2007-04-12;2007;April;REPORT;Positive;0.6316770911216736;more fundamentally stronger than currently expected wage developments could pose significant upward risks to price stability not least in view of the favourable momentum in labour markets observed over the past few quarters

2007-04-12;2007;April;REPORT;Negative;0.992448091506958;whereas in previous months this moderation reflected a decline in the growth rate of household borrowing in an environment of rising mortgage lending rates throughout the euro area and a slowing increase in house prices in some regions in february it was due to a moderation in the growth of loans to nonfinancial corporations
2007-04-12;2007;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.7816852331161499;when assessing such developments it should be borne in mind that monthly figures can be influenced by temporary factors and should thus not be overstated
2007-04-12;2007;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9920253753662109;indeed the strong growth in private sector credit reflects the continuation of the strong trend in the growth of borrowing by nonfinancial corporations seen since mid2004

2007-04-12;2007;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9921932816505432;the continued robust expansion of money and credit reflects the low levels of interest rates over a prolonged period of time and the strengthening of economic activity in the euro area

2007-04-12;2007;April;REPORT;Positive;0.504191517829895;in this environment of ample liquidity the continued vigorous expansion of money and credit points to upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term
2007-04-12;2007;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9920342564582825;monetary developments therefore continue to require very careful monitoring particularly against the background of a solid expansion in economic activity and continued strong property market developments in many parts of the euro area
2007-04-12;2007;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.983992874622345;to sum up in assessing price trends it is important to look through any shortterm volatility in inflation rates
2007-04-12;2007;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9871731996536255;the relevant horizon for monetary policy is the medium term

2007-04-12;2007;April;REPORT;Positive;0.4221726357936859;given the vigorous monetary and credit growth in an environment of already ample liquidity a crosscheck of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis supports the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium to longer term
2007-04-12;2007;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9802400469779968;accordingly the governing council will continue to monitor very closely all developments
2007-04-12;2007;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9664596915245056;indeed it is essential to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise

2007-04-12;2007;April;REPORT;Positive;0.6951855421066284;indeed as regards fiscal policy it is of the utmost importance to use the momentum of the improved economic situation and to press ahead vigorously with budgetary consolidation
2007-04-12;2007;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9907321333885193;government deficit and debttogdp ratios in euro area countries in 2006 have turned out to be significantly better than anticipated
2007-04-12;2007;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9907138347625732;but this positive outcome largely reflects buoyant tax revenues in the context of a favourable macroeconomic environment offsetting in some cases higher than planned public expenditure
2007-04-12;2007;April;REPORT;Positive;0.98996502161026;the better than expected fiscal outcomes in 2006 should lead to more ambitious targets for 2007 and beyond allowing revenue windfalls to be fully allocated to deficit and debt reduction
2007-04-12;2007;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9778562188148499;furthermore procyclical fiscal policies should be avoided in all countries

2007-04-12;2007;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9797124862670898;we also support ambitious structural reforms which would further contribute to the smooth functioning of monetary union and support growth potential and job creation
2007-04-12;2007;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9869834184646606;in particular improving labour market flexibility to better align wage and productivity developments and facilitating labour mobility would further strengthen the resilience of countries to shocks and ensure their competitiveness
