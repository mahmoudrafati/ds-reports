2007-07-05;2007;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.6657304763793945;such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting sustainable economic growth and job creation in the euro area
2007-07-05;2007;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9419136047363281;allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail starting with the economic analysis
2007-07-05;2007;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9922572374343872;the latest data and survey releases have remained broadly positive supporting the view that economic activity in the euro area in the second quarter of 2007 continued to expand at solid rates in line with our baseline scenario
2007-07-05;2007;July;REPORT;Negative;0.7555023431777954;looking ahead the mediumterm outlook for economic activity remains favourable
2007-07-05;2007;July;REPORT;Positive;0.8997077941894531;the conditions are in place for the euro area economy to continue to grow at a sustained rate
2007-07-05;2007;July;REPORT;Positive;0.898387610912323;as regards the external environment global economic growth has become more balanced across regions and while moderating somewhat remains robust

2007-07-05;2007;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9374032616615295;the risks surrounding this favourable outlook for economic growth are broadly balanced over the shorter term
2007-07-05;2007;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9412817358970642;at medium to longer horizons the balance of risks remains on the downside owing mainly to external factors
2007-07-05;2007;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9887357354164124;these relate in particular to fears of a rise in protectionist pressures the possibility of further increases in oil prices concerns about possible disorderly developments owing to global imbalances and potential shifts in financial market sentiment

2007-07-05;2007;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9849855899810791;looking ahead the shortterm profile of annual inflation rates continues to be determined largely by current and past energy price developments as last years volatility in energy prices leads to significant base effects
2007-07-05;2007;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.6963768005371094;on the basis of the current level of oil prices and oil price futures which show an upward slope annual inflation rates are likely to fall only slightly in the months ahead before rising again significantly towards the end of the year
2007-07-05;2007;July;REPORT;Negative;0.829101026058197;at the policyrelevant mediumterm horizon risks to the outlook for price stability remain on the upside
2007-07-05;2007;July;REPORT;Negative;0.893600344657898;these risks relate notably to the domestic side
2007-07-05;2007;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9919202327728271;in particular as capacity utilisation in the euro area economy is high and labour markets continue to improve constraints are emerging which could lead in particular to stronger than expected wage developments
2007-07-05;2007;July;REPORT;Negative;0.8368292450904846;in addition pricing power in market segments with low competition may increase in such an environment
2007-07-05;2007;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9724901914596558;such developments would pose significant upward risks to price stability
2007-07-05;2007;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.7539557218551636;it is therefore crucial that all parties concerned meet their responsibilities
2007-07-05;2007;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9577832818031311;wage agreements in particular should be sufficiently differentiated to take into account price competitiveness positions the still high level of unemployment in many economies and sectorspecific productivity developments
2007-07-05;2007;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9400593042373657;the governing council stresses the importance of avoiding wage developments that would eventually lead to inflationary pressures and harm the purchasing power of all euro area citizens
2007-07-05;2007;July;REPORT;Negative;0.915132999420166;in addition upside risks to price stability arise from increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those anticipated thus far and the potentially procyclical stance of fiscal policy in some countries
2007-07-05;2007;July;REPORT;Negative;0.7233458161354065;finally on the external side upside risks stem from the possibility of further unexpected oil price rises
2007-07-05;2007;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9430916905403137;the monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer horizons
2007-07-05;2007;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9907028675079346;the underlying rate of monetary expansion remains strong in a context of already ample liquidity
2007-07-05;2007;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9865320324897766;the ongoing strength of monetary expansion is reflected in the continued rapid growth of m3 which increased at an annual rate of 107 in may as well as the still high level of credit growth
2007-07-05;2007;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9918389916419983;the strong rate of monetary and credit expansion reflects in part favourable financing conditions and solid economic growth
2007-07-05;2007;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9779660105705261;when identifying and assessing the policyrelevant underlying trends in monetary and credit expansion it is important to look through shorterterm volatility and the effects of changes in the slope of the yield curve and external factors that are likely to prove temporary
2007-07-05;2007;July;REPORT;Positive;0.8901416063308716;taking this perspective there are several indications that higher shortterm interest rates are now influencing monetary dynamics although they have not as yet significantly dampened the overall strength of the underlying rate of monetary and credit expansion
2007-07-05;2007;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.883503258228302;for example increases in shortterm rates have contributed to a more moderate expansion of the narrow aggregate m1 in recent quarters
2007-07-05;2007;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9664076566696167;equally the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector has shown some signs of stabilising since mid2006 albeit at doubledigit levels
2007-07-05;2007;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8093876838684082;the stabilisation of loan growth is now becoming more broadbased and is apparent in borrowing by both nonfinancial corporations and households
2007-07-05;2007;July;REPORT;Negative;0.98936927318573;in the latter case the stabilisation of loan growth also reflects some moderation in house price dynamics although house price growth nonetheless remains at high levels on average in the euro area
2007-07-05;2007;July;REPORT;Positive;0.8948681950569153;given the continued vigour of money and credit expansion there are clear indications of upside risks to price stability at medium to longerterm horizons
2007-07-05;2007;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9642186760902405;following several years of robust monetary growth the liquidity situation in the euro area remains ample
2007-07-05;2007;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9876097440719604;in this environment monetary developments continue to require very careful monitoring particularly against the background of the expansion in economic activity and still strong property market developments
2007-07-05;2007;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.984531819820404;to sum up in assessing price trends it is important to look beyond any shortterm volatility in inflation rates
2007-07-05;2007;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9871731996536255;the relevant horizon for monetary policy is the medium term
2007-07-05;2007;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9778013825416565;risks to the mediumterm outlook for price stability remain on the upside relating in particular to the domestic side
2007-07-05;2007;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9913892149925232;as capacity utilisation is high and labour markets continue to improve constraints are emerging which could lead in particular to stronger than expected wage and profit margin developments
2007-07-05;2007;July;REPORT;Positive;0.4221726357936859;given the vigorous monetary and credit growth in an environment of already ample liquidity a crosscheck of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis supports the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium to longer term
2007-07-05;2007;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9787163138389587;accordingly the governing council will monitor closely all developments in order to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise and medium to longerterm inflation expectations in the euro area remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability
2007-07-05;2007;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.48149389028549194;looking ahead acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term remains warranted

2007-07-05;2007;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8116670250892639;in the current overall benign economic environment it is imperative that all governments comply with the provisions of the stability and growth pact on fiscal consolidation in economic good times and that all the countries concerned honour the commitments they made at the eurogroup meeting in berlin on 20 april 2007 as agreed in berlin taking advantage of the favourable cyclical conditions would enable most euro area countries to achieve their mediumterm objectives in 2008 or 2009 and all of them should aim for 2010 at the latest
2007-07-05;2007;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9485781788825989;these pledges should be reflected in the 2008 budget plans so as to avoid repeating governments past failure to adjust fiscal balances in economic good times
2007-07-05;2007;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8938068747520447;at the same time the governing council welcomes the emphasis placed by the ecofin council on measures to improve the quality and efficiency of public finances
2007-07-05;2007;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9467920660972595;as regards structural reforms the governing council fully supports all measures that improve the functioning of product labour and financial markets
