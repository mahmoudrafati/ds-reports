2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9455198645591736;transcript of the press briefing held by jeanclaude trichet president of the european central bank following the meeting of the governing council on 2 august 2007 trichet let me just say a few words and then i will be ready to respond to questions as usual
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Positive;0.9910707473754883;recent economic developments and survey indicators confirm that sustained economic growth continued in the euro area through the second quarter
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Positive;0.6301754117012024;rising oil prices emerging capacity constraints and the potential for stronger wage and cost dynamics among other factors imply upside risks to price stability over the medium term
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.5106205344200134;the existence of upside risks to price stability at medium to longerterm horizons is confirmed by the strength of the underlying rate of monetary expansion strong vigilance is therefore of the essence to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9834311604499817;both our previous economic and monetary analysis as expressed in particular in the last press conference have been fully confirmed by the ongoing information we have received since the last meeting of the governing council
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9791077971458435;let me also stress that we never precommit we decide at the moment of the meeting of the governing council on the basis of the information that we have facts and figures and according to the judgement that we make at that moment
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.5368383526802063;i reemphasise that we never precommit
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Negative;0.99068683385849;let me also say that we are experiencing a period of market nervousness a period where we see volatility in markets in general and reappreciation of risks
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Positive;0.8922697305679321;we think that these developments in financial markets deserve attention
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.8445701003074646;shifts in market sentiment need careful monitoring
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Positive;0.6795692443847656;we will continue to pay great attention to the developments in the market over the period to come
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9355962872505188;i am now open to questions
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9105541706085205;question just three quick questions first of all in your brief remarks do you intend for us to reinterpret the meaning of strong vigilance as opposed to how it has been used in the past
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Negative;0.8271006941795349;my second question is much of the nervousness that you describe and that we have been seeing in financial markets has to do with the unwinding of novel financial instruments which we are now learning have become conduits for instability around the world but i wondered whether you could also say whether you felt that was the whole picture or whether recent financial innovations were also contributing to the stability of financial markets
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.8570829629898071;and my third question is could you comment on the macroeconomic effect of rising interest rates through this year especially now that longterm interest rates have done what they historically have done and now that risk premiums are being reassessed
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.6297588348388672;do you see macroeconomic effects of rising interest rates
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9530335664749146;trichet on the first question i do not ask for any new interpretation of the words i have pronounced
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.978749692440033;they have exactly the same meaning as before
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.7625433206558228;i have always said when using the words strong vigilance do not forget that we never precommit
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.6464399099349976;there is nothing new there
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Negative;0.6536341905593872;on the second point i told you and colleagues that are here that we thought at the level of the governing council and also in the constituency of central bankers at a global level that there had been in the past a degree of underpricing of risks some underassessment of risks
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9624410271644592;and i said that at a moment when there was no particular turbulence on the market but it was our judgement our collegial appreciation
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.87135249376297;in the present episode we see a process of reappreciation of risks in general
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9867554903030396;and i would qualify this episode as a process of reappreciation of risks which can be interpreted as a phenomenon of normalisation of risk pricing in a number of markets
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9793410897254944;we will follow this evolution very carefully
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Positive;0.7195592522621155;i said a number of weeks or months ago  and i said it repeatedly  that we were calling for an orderly and smooth reappreciation of risks
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.6258818507194519;we asked market participants and investors to be as keen as possible to avoid sharp and abrupt corrections
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9377821683883667;now let me turn to your third question
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9586169719696045;the information we are giving at the moment is very much in the minds of a very large number of observers economists and market participants
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.5035739541053772;and i trust that what we are doing is to pave the way for economic growth to be as sustainable as everybody hopes
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Positive;0.986211895942688;we have good news in the real economy
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.7928910851478577;you gave a lot of attention to the fact that the imf had revised up global growth and euro area growth
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Negative;0.8392015099525452;a lot of attention was also given to the fact that our unemployment rate in the euro area is now at the lowest level since 26 years so this is something which is substantial
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Positive;0.5969034433364868;it is our duty to preserve stability to anchor inflationary expectations and through that mean to permit sustainable growth to continue as everybody expects it will do
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.8226551413536072;this is the way we are contributing to sustainable growth
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.8746534585952759;question following up on that question the current phase of market movements that we see is that something that you would characterise as a smooth reappreciation of risk or is that something that is abrupt and undesirable
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9377220273017883;and then also as a second question i know that the ecb never precommits itself but sometimes you find it necessary or advisable to give guidance to financial markets and in the wake of announcements from the ecb markets essentially are now priced very heavily for the ecb raising rates in september
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9225981831550598;is that something you think is appropriate and what is your view on the pricing of risks for december which has actually fallen back a lot in the space of the recent market turbulence
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.8931462168693542;trichet on the first question i will stick to what i said
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.6878864169120789;we are in an episode where prices that were underassessing an element of risk in a number of markets are normalising
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9662372469902039;i will not give any other qualification to the situation it is a process of normalisation
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9674406051635742;the first quality to be demonstrated in circumstances when we see significant increases in measures of volatility in a large range of markets and asset classes by market participants and investors and of course by authorities is to keep their composure
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9787073135375977;that is something important and it would permit the evolution of the market to be as effective as possible in terms of going back to a normal assessment of risks in general
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9341133832931519;as regards mediumterm future interest rates after september i will say absolutely nothing
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Positive;0.8460409641265869;my message today is a message of strong vigilance without forgetting that we never precommit
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9324989914894104;beyond that i will say absolutely nothing
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.97518390417099;we will assess the situation and judge on the basis of facts and figures and the development of the situation
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9277485013008118;question president trichet i understand that you have used the word strong vigilance and this also goes hand in hand with no precommitment but could you tell us as we interpret this word whether policy will still be on the accommodative side in september
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9675849080085754;trichet i will tell you that when the time comes in september after our decision in the press conference
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.7490724921226501;question i have two short questions
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.7613949775695801;in light of recent market turbulences what is your assessment of the liquidity in the euro area at the moment
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9212773442268372;and you will release the bank lending survey tomorrow so do you have any new information on credit standards within the euro area and are you seeing changes in the credit standards from banks visàvis corporate and household borrowers
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9700927138328552;trichet i would only speak about the figures that were published and to which i alluded in my brief words at the very beginning
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9637213945388794;drawing on the figures we have on the monetary analysis side of the two pillars loans to the private sector grew at a rate of 108 in june a little bit more than in may and loans to nonfinancial corporations at 133 in june against 128 in may
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.6926376223564148;m3 as you know is very dynamic
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.973128616809845;so we are in a universe which is characterised by a continuation of the observation that we had made before
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.8326526284217834;question i have three questions
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9551152586936951;is calling this press conference today part of an effort to ensure that market participants keep their cool
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Negative;0.8102614879608154;secondly would you say that financing conditions remain favourable as you have said in the last two statements
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9679152369499207;and third is the concept of consensus getting a reworking on the governing council right now
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.8553549647331238;can you give us a little sense of how the discussion was and whether or not there is more debate over the topic of consensus
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9551939964294434;trichet on your first question i will only repeat that keeping ones composure is important in any circumstances but certainly in circumstances of market nervousness as is the case presently
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9669327735900879;as for the second question i will say how i qualify the situation at our next press conference
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Positive;0.9554480910301208;today i have said that we are in a situation which in our opinion calls for strong vigilance and that our previous diagnosis has been fully confirmed
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9613380432128906;on the third question i would say that we have had absolutely no change in our own methodology and way of assessing the situation and expressing views
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.6314601302146912;question the recent turbulences in financial markets have had an effect on private sector financial institutions to an extent which at least provoked the german authorities to step in and rescue a german lender
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Negative;0.8857454061508179;there were times in economic history when central banks also felt they had to do something in order to prevent a banking crisis
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.642246663570404;do you think we have reached this stage now and should the ecb take part in these rescue operations we are seeing
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9545663595199585;trichet i will stick to what my colleague axel weber has said on this particular case and what has been said since last monday
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9200301766395569;i will not add anything to that
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.6938775777816772;question a question on italy there is a lot of talk in italy about the possibility of selling reserves to reduce debt and selling gold in particular
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.8753641843795776;do you have any reaction on this
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.982421338558197;trichet at this stage i have no other comment that the rule of the treaty must be respected fully in all circumstances
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9771538972854614;on the basis of very recent news that has come we will analyse the situation very very carefully
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9762153625488281;but i repeat the rule of the treaty must be fully respected
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9250491857528687;and this calls for a very rapid and precise examination of what is at stake
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9707682132720947;question mr president was the decision to use the word vigilance today unanimous
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9724492430686951;trichet we had exactly the same kind of methodology as we had before
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9746527075767517;i convey this message and this word on behalf of the governing council
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.8571691513061523;question what role did the strength of the euro play in your discussions today
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Negative;0.6480075120925903;and are you seeing excessive volatility in the currency movements
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9526383876800537;trichet our decision today was not to change interest rates
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9832911491394043;and we always look at all parameters without any exception in taking our decision without giving this particular parameter that you have mentioned more than its share in our overall assessment
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.8975294232368469;question i dont think anybody expected this outturn today with the press conference
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9558041095733643;it was seen as probably the least likely scenario as to how you might communicate the message that you had to communicate today
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.7398155331611633;what accounted for that and are you concerned that there will be some questions about the communication parameters
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9187124371528625;and my final question is do you think that this might lead you to consider having a regular press conference every august in the future
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.8391566276550293;i mean weve had two years now where there have been lastminute surprises
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9799144864082336;trichet this is not a press conference this is a press briefing and we are very keen to issue information not anonymously but publicly as frequently and as soon as it is necessary because as you know we have a policy of communicating only publicly
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9809142351150513;all other communications are null and void and are made on the basis of something which is not in line with the decision of the governing council
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9788267612457275;that being said we constantly reflect on what we could do in order to be as efficient as possible in terms of our relationship with you
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9680647253990173;let me add that it was worth having this press briefing also in view of how many of you did come
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9730532169342041;question are you worried about a possible banking crisis
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.5305561423301697;there is a german smaller bank so to say which instead of having a hole of 35 billion is possibly going to have a 17 billion and so on hole and people are already saying in the market that this will entrain very big consequences especially also in the german market
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9634181261062622;trichet on the particular issue that you have mentioned i will not add anything to what has been said by the german entities concerned themselves by the authorities and by axel weber
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.8605712652206421;on the overall assessment of the situation on the markets i feel that we are observing a reassessment of risks
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.6459874510765076;i mentioned already what our judgement was some time ago and again i see a phenomenon of normalisation of the assessment and pricing of risks
2007-08-02;2007;August;REPORT;Positive;0.779477596282959;i also said that in circumstances that are characterised by increasing volatility and by the reassessment of a number of risks in a number of markets it was important that the market participants investors and authorities keep their composure maintain their sangfroid
