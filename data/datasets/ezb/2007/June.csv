2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9892338514328003;at todays meeting we decided to raise the key ecb interest rates by 25 basis points
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9855250716209412;this decision was taken in view of the prevailing upside risks to price stability over the medium term that we have identified through both our economic and monetary analyses
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9630575776100159;todays decision will contribute to ensuring that medium to longerterm inflation expectations in the euro area remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability

2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Negative;0.5584136843681335;after todays increase given the positive economic environment in the euro area our monetary policy is still on the accommodative side with overall financing conditions favourable money and credit growth vigorous and liquidity in the euro area ample
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.8742175698280334;looking ahead acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term is warranted
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9906086921691895;the governing council will monitor closely all developments to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9419136047363281;allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail starting with the economic analysis
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9922628402709961;incoming information clearly confirms that the euro area economy continues to expand at a pace which is significantly stronger than generally expected a year ago
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9066880345344543;with a quarteronquarter rate of 06 real gdp growth in the first quarter of 2007 was again somewhat above previous expectations
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9914109706878662;other available information on economic activity notably various surveys of business and consumer confidence suggests that solid growth has continued into the second quarter
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Negative;0.7555023431777954;looking ahead the mediumterm outlook for economic activity remains favourable
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Positive;0.8997077941894531;the conditions are in place for the euro area economy to continue to grow at a sustained rate
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Positive;0.898387610912323;as regards the external environment global economic growth has become more balanced across regions and while moderating somewhat remains robust
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9703206419944763;external conditions thus continue to provide support for euro area exports
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9923896193504333;domestic demand in the euro area is also expected to maintain its relatively strong momentum
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9922086000442505;investment should remain dynamic benefiting from financing conditions which remain favourable accumulated and ongoing strong corporate earnings balance sheet restructuring as well as business efficiency gains achieved over an extended period
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Positive;0.979353666305542;meanwhile consumption should be supported by developments in real disposable income as labour market conditions continue to improve
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9728325009346008;this outlook is also reflected in the new eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9840752482414246;the projections foresee average annual real gdp growth in a range between 23 and 29 in 2007 and between 18 and 28 in 2008 in comparison with the previous ecb staff projections the ranges projected for real gdp growth in 2007 are within the upper part of the ranges from march
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9327110052108765;for 2008 the ranges have been revised marginally downwards following the increase in oil prices over recent months
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9767727255821228;in the governing councils view the risks surrounding this favourable outlook for economic growth are broadly balanced over the shorter term
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9412817358970642;at medium to longer horizons the balance of risks remains on the downside owing mainly to external factors
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9887357354164124;these relate in particular to fears of a rise in protectionist pressures the possibility of further increases in oil prices concerns about possible disorderly developments owing to global imbalances and potential shifts in financial market sentiment
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.4916909635066986;as regards price developments oil prices have risen again over recent months
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9384341239929199;accordingly as reflected in eurostats flash estimate annual hicp inflation was 19 in may 2007 unchanged from april but somewhat higher than expected a few months ago
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9849855899810791;looking ahead the shortterm profile of annual inflation rates continues to be determined largely by current and past energy price developments as last years volatility in energy prices leads to significant base effects
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.8035094141960144;on the basis of the current level of oil prices and oil price futures which show an upward slope annual inflation rates are likely to fall slightly in the months ahead before rising again significantly towards the end of the year
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.7603703141212463;consistent with this view eurosystem staff projects average annual hicp inflation of between 18 and 22 in 2007 and between 14 and 26 in 2008 compared with the march 2007 ecb staff projections the range projected for inflation in 2007 is somewhat higher largely reflecting higher oil prices
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9882688522338867;the projected range for inflation in 2008 is unchanged
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9700341820716858;in this context let me remind you of the conditional nature of these projections which are based on a series of technical assumptions including assumptions for future short and longterm interest rates that are based on market expectations derived from the yield curve as well as assumptions for oil and nonenergy commodity prices
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.768903911113739;at the policyrelevant mediumterm horizon risks to the outlook for price stability remain on the upside in the governing councils view
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Negative;0.893600344657898;these risks relate notably to the domestic side
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9921702742576599;in particular capacity utilisation in the euro area economy is increasing and labour markets are gradually improving
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Negative;0.8816918134689331;accordingly there is a risk that wage developments will be stronger than expected which would pose significant upward risks to price stability
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Negative;0.8368292450904846;in addition pricing power in market segments with low competition may increase in such an environment
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.7539557218551636;it is therefore crucial that all parties concerned meet their responsibilities
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9577832818031311;wage agreements in particular should be sufficiently differentiated to take into account price competitiveness positions the still high level of unemployment in many economies and sectorspecific productivity developments
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9641847610473633;the governing council stresses that wage developments should be avoided which would eventually lead to inflationary pressures and harm the purchasing power of all euro area citizens
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9315047264099121;in addition upside risks to price stability arise from increases in administered prices beyond those anticipated thus far
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Negative;0.7233458161354065;finally on the external side upside risks stem from the possibility of further unexpected oil price rises
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9430916905403137;the monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer horizons
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9907028675079346;the underlying rate of monetary expansion remains strong in a context of already ample liquidity
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9838031530380249;the ongoing strength of monetary expansion is reflected in the continued rapid growth of m3 which reached an annual rate of 104 in april as well as the still high level of credit growth
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9918389916419983;the strong rate of monetary and credit expansion reflects in part favourable financing conditions and solid economic growth
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.7596288919448853;in the short term monetary and credit developments can be affected inter alia by the shape of the yield curve and external factors and be subject to some degree of volatility
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9820578098297119;in assessing the policyrelevant underlying trends in monetary and credit growth it is important to look through such transitory aspects
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Positive;0.8901416063308716;taking this perspective there are several indications that higher shortterm interest rates are now influencing monetary dynamics although they have not as yet significantly dampened the overall strength of the underlying rate of monetary and credit expansion
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.883503258228302;for example increases in shortterm rates have contributed to a more moderate expansion of the narrow aggregate m1 in recent quarters
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9664076566696167;equally the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector has shown some signs of stabilising since mid2006 albeit at doubledigit levels
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.960869312286377;the stabilisation of loan growth is now becoming more broadbased as evidenced in recent months by developments in borrowing by nonfinancial corporations and by households
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9927676916122437;at the same time house price growth has come down somewhat although remaining at high levels on average in the euro area
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Positive;0.8971249461174011;taking into account both shortterm factors and the underlying trend of the continued vigorous expansion of money and credit there are clear indications of upside risks to price stability at medium to longerterm horizons
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9642186760902405;following several years of robust monetary growth the liquidity situation in the euro area remains ample
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9876097440719604;in this environment monetary developments continue to require very careful monitoring particularly against the background of the expansion in economic activity and still strong property market developments
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.984531819820404;to sum up in assessing price trends it is important to look beyond any shortterm volatility in inflation rates
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9871731996536255;the relevant horizon for monetary policy is the medium term
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9778013825416565;risks to the mediumterm outlook for price stability remain on the upside relating in particular to the domestic side
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9914469718933105;as capacity utilisation increases and labour markets gradually improve constraints are emerging which could lead in particular to stronger than expected wage developments
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Positive;0.4221726357936859;given the vigorous monetary and credit growth in an environment of already ample liquidity a crosscheck of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis supports the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium to longer term
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9906237721443176;accordingly the governing council will monitor closely all developments in order to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9884417057037354;this will support the solid anchoring of medium to longerterm inflation expectations in the euro area at levels consistent with price stability
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.8742175698280334;looking ahead acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term is warranted
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9875479936599731;as regards fiscal policy all countries should be in line with the rules and provisions of the stability and growth pact
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Positive;0.5426212549209595;this will be crucial for the smooth functioning of monetary union given that the stability and growth pact is an indispensable part of its institutional setting
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9902432560920715;following the significant budgetary improvement recorded in 2006 the latest available forecasts suggest a further reduction in the government deficittogdp ratio of the euro area over the period 200708 this reflects in particular projected ongoing strong revenue collection in the context of a favourable macroeconomic outlook
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Negative;0.990825355052948;however the structural improvement is more muted
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9118286371231079;the current economic good times should be used to rapidly redress the remaining budgetary imbalances in euro area countries as well as to accelerate the adjustment towards their mediumterm objectives of sound budget positions with a focus on expenditure restraint
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9573004245758057;as agreed by the euro area finance ministers at the eurogroup meeting in berlin on 20 april taking advantage of the favourable cyclical conditions would enable most euro area members to achieve their mediumterm objectives in 2008 or 2009 and all of them should aim for 2010 at the latest
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Negative;0.7735823392868042;this is particularly important with a view to reducing the still high government debt ratios and preparing for the fiscal challenges arising from population ageing
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.7622593641281128;in order to ensure that fiscal developments are monitored effectively the governing council supports all efforts by eurostat to improve the fiscal data situation
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Positive;0.8512139320373535;it also welcomes the increased emphasis placed by the ecofin council on measures to improve the quality of public finances and increase the efficiency of public administration
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9631703495979309;as regards structural reforms the governing council fully supports any efforts that enhance competition increase productivity and foster economic flexibility thus promoting higher sustainable real gdp growth and employment
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9641087651252747;in this respect we strongly back reforms focusing on reducing labour market rigidities product market barriers and administrative burdens and on stimulating technological innovation
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9489150047302246;exploiting the complementary nature of reforms would increase their benefits in terms of longterm economic dynamism and price stability
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Negative;0.93441241979599;furthermore the importance of a successful conclusion of the doha round of trade talks for productivity and growth in europe should not be underestimated
2007-06-06;2007;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9764494895935059;in the end higher productivity growth will allow increases in real wages without negatively affecting employment thereby supporting the income growth of the euro area workforce
