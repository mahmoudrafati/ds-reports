2007-01-11;2007;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9922216534614563;drawing on the latest information the evidence from various confidence surveys and indicatorbased estimates supports the assessment that robust economic growth has continued and that the situation in labour markets has improved further
2007-01-11;2007;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9894772171974182;while some volatility in the quarteronquarter growth rates around the turn of the year may be observed  associated with the impact of changes in indirect taxes in a large euro area country  the information available continues to be in line with our baseline scenario

2007-01-11;2007;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9879881143569946;overall global growth should remain robust and therefore continue to provide support for euro area exports

2007-01-11;2007;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9929327964782715;consumption should also strengthen further over time in line with developments in real disposable income as employment conditions continue to improve
2007-01-11;2007;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9637256264686584;in the governing councils view the risks surrounding this broadly favourable outlook for economic growth over the coming years lie mainly on the downside
2007-01-11;2007;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9877282381057739;the main risks relate to fears of a rise in protectionist pressures the possibility of a renewed increase in oil prices and concerns about possible disorderly developments due to global imbalances

2007-01-11;2007;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9817894101142883;on account of their volatility over recent months and owing to base effects energy prices will continue to play an important role in determining the profile of annual rates of hicp inflation in early 2007 together with the impact of higher indirect taxes
2007-01-11;2007;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9700352549552917;looking further ahead annual inflation rates are projected to hover around 2 over this year and next
2007-01-11;2007;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9901461005210876;in the governing councils view the outlook for price developments remains subject to upside risks stemming in particular from a stronger than anticipated passthrough of previous oil price increases increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those announced thus far and the possibility of renewed oil price increases
2007-01-11;2007;January;REPORT;Positive;0.991192638874054;more fundamentally given the favourable momentum of real gdp growth over the past few quarters and positive labour market developments wage dynamics could be stronger than currently expected
2007-01-11;2007;January;REPORT;Negative;0.36680540442466736;it is therefore crucial that social partners continue to meet their responsibilities
2007-01-11;2007;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9421824216842651;in this context wage agreements should take into account productivity developments while recognising the still high level of unemployment and price competitiveness positions
2007-01-11;2007;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9608092308044434;as stated on previous occasions it is also important that wage settlements move away from automatic backwardlooking indexation mechanisms
2007-01-11;2007;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.7950588464736938;turning to the monetary analysis annual m3 growth rose to 93 in november
2007-01-11;2007;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9844542145729065;this represents its highest annual rate of growth since the introduction of the euro and indeed its strongest aggregate growth in the euro area group of countries since 1990 while the significance of monthly figures should not be overstated as they may also be influenced by temporary factors the series of strong monetary data over the past couple of months underscore the continued very dynamic underlying rate of broad money expansion in the euro area
2007-01-11;2007;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9537070393562317;rising shortterm interest rates in combination with low longterm interest rates have exerted only a limited influence over monetary developments in recent months
2007-01-11;2007;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.6565584540367126;this has mainly taken the form of shifts among the components of m3 rather than constraining the overall expansion of m3 itself
2007-01-11;2007;January;REPORT;Negative;0.838636577129364;in particular over recent months the annual growth rate of m1 has moderated somewhat reflecting shifts from overnight deposits into other components of m3 that offer more marketrelated returns
2007-01-11;2007;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9904636144638062;all in all the rate of monetary and credit expansion remains rapid reflecting the low level of interest rates and the strengthening of economic activity in the euro area

2007-01-11;2007;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9699181914329529;while  in the context of rising interest rates  the growth of household borrowing has shown signs of stabilisation in recent months albeit at very high rates the growth of borrowing by nonfinancial corporations continues to trend upwards
2007-01-11;2007;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9900016784667969;thus credit continues to expand rapidly and in a broadbased fashion thereby remaining the main driver of the current strong monetary growth when viewed from the counterpart side of the mfi balance sheet
2007-01-11;2007;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9358294010162354;taking a medium to longerterm perspective the latest developments are consistent with a continuation of the persistent upward trend in the underlying rate of monetary expansion
2007-01-11;2007;January;REPORT;Positive;0.8709598779678345;following several years of robust monetary growth the liquidity situation in the euro area is ample by all plausible measures
2007-01-11;2007;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9854577779769897;continued strong monetary and credit growth in an environment of ample liquidity point to upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term
2007-01-11;2007;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9918150305747986;monetary developments therefore continue to require very careful monitoring particularly against the background of improved economic conditions and continued strong property market developments in many parts of the euro area
2007-01-11;2007;January;REPORT;Negative;0.8038811683654785;to sum up annual inflation rates are projected to hover around 2 this year and next with risks to this outlook remaining on the upside
2007-01-11;2007;January;REPORT;Positive;0.6450712084770203;given the very strong monetary and credit growth in an environment of already ample liquidity a crosscheck of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis supports the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium to longer term
2007-01-11;2007;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9687767624855042;hence very close monitoring of all developments is of the essence in order to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise
2007-01-11;2007;January;REPORT;Positive;0.987084686756134;this will permit medium to longerterm inflation expectations in the euro area to remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability
2007-01-11;2007;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.8964850902557373;therefore looking ahead acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term is warranted
2007-01-11;2007;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9859944581985474;as regards fiscal policy almost all euro area countries have submitted their updated stability programmes
2007-01-11;2007;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9585829377174377;while these programmes generally indicate that governments plan to proceed towards sound budgetary positions there are also indications that budget targets do not consistently imply sufficient consolidation and that concrete and credible measures have not yet been specified in all programmes
2007-01-11;2007;January;REPORT;Negative;0.8749952912330627;these indications are a cause of concern and entail risks for the future
2007-01-11;2007;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.8966562151908875;against the background of current good times it is essential that sound budgetary positions are reached in countries with fiscal imbalances and that a procyclical loosening is avoided in all member countries
2007-01-11;2007;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9884569644927979;moreover countries need to improve the quality of their tax and expenditure policies as part of a comprehensive mediumterm strategy so as to strengthen confidence in a growth and employmentfriendly and sustainable fiscal policy environment
2007-01-11;2007;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.5100917220115662;with regard to structural reforms over recent years euro area countries have become increasingly aware of the necessity to adjust to the challenges of increased global competition ageing populations and accelerating technological change
2007-01-11;2007;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.6856235265731812;in response some have undertaken reform efforts to create more job opportunities
2007-01-11;2007;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9881731867790222;both as a reflection of these reforms and as a result of wage moderation in some countries the euro area has seen a remarkable dynamism in employment growth over the recent period
2007-01-11;2007;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.965456485748291;notably around 12 million new jobs were created in the euro area in the eightyear period since the start of stage three of emu
2007-01-11;2007;January;REPORT;Negative;0.980231761932373;this compares favourably with the little more than two million new jobs created in the same group of countries in the eight years before 1999 however the governing council notes that significant structural impediments continue to exist and contribute to explaining why unemployment rates are still unacceptably high and participation in the labour market is still low by international standards
2007-01-11;2007;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.987623929977417;with other countries in the world also increasing the competitiveness of their markets it is essential for each euro area country to minimise the market distortions induced by its particular regulations and for the euro area as a whole to remove remaining barriers to market integration
2007-01-11;2007;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9342048168182373;this requires the implementation of comprehensive reforms necessary to deepen market integration soften labour market rigidities and improve wage flexibility in order to continue fostering growth and new employment opportunities
