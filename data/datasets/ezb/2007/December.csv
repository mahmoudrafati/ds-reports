2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.953532338142395;let me report on the outcome of our meeting which was also attended by the president of the eurogroup prime minister juncker and commissioner almunia
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9924543499946594;on the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses we decided at todays meeting to leave the key ecb interest rates unchanged
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9583799839019775;the latest information has confirmed the existence of strong shortterm upward pressure on inflation with the hicp inflation rate reaching 30 in november
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.7046251893043518;it has also fully confirmed our assessment that there are upside risks to price stability over the medium term
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Positive;0.7797975540161133;against this background and with money and credit growth remaining very vigorous in the euro area the governing council stands ready to counter upside risks to price stability as required by its mandate
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9825339913368225;the economic fundamentals of the euro area remain sound
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Negative;0.993543267250061;however the reappraisal of risk in financial markets is still evolving and is accompanied by continued uncertainty about the potential impact on the real economy
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9770286679267883;we will therefore monitor very closely all developments
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9793877601623535;by acting in a firm and timely manner on the basis of our assessment we will ensure that secondround effects and risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Negative;0.8477491140365601;firmly anchoring medium and longterm inflation expectations in line with price stability is all the more important at times of financial market volatility and increased uncertainty
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Positive;0.7328131794929504;as regards the financial markets we will continue to pay great attention to developments over the coming weeks
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9419136047363281;allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail starting with the economic analysis
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9516623616218567;according to eurostats first estimate the quarteronquarter growth rate of euro area real gdp in the third quarter of 2007 was 07 in line with the earlier flash estimate
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Positive;0.977939784526825;domestic demand remained the main driver of economic growth in the third quarter confirming the sustained nature of economic expansion in the euro area
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.8224259614944458;the latest information on economic activity from various confidence surveys and indicatorbased estimates supports the assessment that economic growth has continued into the fourth quarter of this year though probably at a more moderate pace than in the third quarter
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9842156767845154;overall the fundamentals of the euro area remain sound
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9710427522659302;profitability has been sustained employment growth has been robust and the unemployment rate has fallen to levels not seen for 25 years
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9758089780807495;these factors are also reflected in the december 2007 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.981306254863739;annual real gdp growth is projected to lie in the range of 24 to 28 in 2007 and be between 15 and 25 in 2008 and between 16 and 26 in 2009 in comparison with the september ecb staff projections the range projected for real gdp growth in 2008 has been revised slightly downwards whereas for 2007 the new range lies within the upper part of the previous one
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Positive;0.6883452534675598;available forecasts from international organisations broadly confirm this outlook
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Positive;0.8560925722122192;the scenario of sustained real gdp growth broadly in line with trend potential is based on the expectation that the global economy will remain resilient with the slowdown of economic growth in the united states partly offset by the continued strength of emerging market economies
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9507501125335693;external demand should therefore provide ongoing support to euro area exports and investment
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9918068647384644;consumption growth should also contribute to economic expansion in line with developments in real disposable income as continued employment growth provides supportive conditions
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Negative;0.991765558719635;that said in view of the potential impact of ongoing financial market volatility and repricing of risk on the real economy the level of uncertainty remains high
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Negative;0.9814505577087402;in the governing councils view the risks surrounding this outlook for economic growth lie on the downside
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Negative;0.9914305806159973;they relate mainly to the potential for a broader impact from the ongoing reappraisal of risk in financial markets on financing conditions and confidence and on world and euro area growth possible further oil and commodity price rises as well as concerns about protectionist pressures and possible disorderly developments owing to global imbalances
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9773406982421875;as regards price developments according to eurostats flash estimate the annual hicp inflation rate increased sharply again in november 2007 to 30 from 26 in october
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9907071590423584;oil prices have risen strongly in recent months and food prices have increased substantially reflecting higher global demand
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9611878991127014;in addition as emphasised on previous occasions we are currently in the midst of a period in which unfavourable effects from energy prices are having a strong upward impact on annual hicp inflation rates owing to the marked decline in oil prices a year ago
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Negative;0.9768386483192444;looking ahead the hicp inflation rate is expected to remain significantly above 2 in the coming months and is likely to moderate only gradually in the course of 2008 hence the period of temporarily high rates of inflation would be somewhat more protracted than previously expected
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9914884567260742;the december eurosystem staff projections foresee annual hicp inflation to be between 20 and 22 in 2007 but then to rise to between 20 and 30 in 2008 for 2009 hicp inflation is projected to lie between 12 and 24
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9832688570022583;compared with the september 2007 ecb staff projections the projected ranges for hicp inflation in 2007 and 2008 have shifted upwards
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9886237382888794;forecasts from international organisations which incorporate recent inflation developments give a broadly similar picture
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Negative;0.7730309367179871;these projections largely mirror the assumed path of oil and food prices for which available futures prices suggest a deceleration in the course of next year
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Positive;0.8122752904891968;on the domestic side unit labour cost growth is projected to increase over the projection horizon
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9827781319618225;in this context it is important to emphasise that the staff projections assume that recent oil and food price dynamics and their impact on hicp inflation will not have broadlybased secondround effects on wagesetting behaviour
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.8816901445388794;this is a key assumption
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Negative;0.8370073437690735;a further key assumption is that growth in profit margins will moderate over the projection horizon
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Negative;0.6070599555969238;in combination these two assumptions imply in the context of the staff projections a continuation of overall contained domestic cost pressures which contributes to the moderation in inflation projected in 2009 in the governing councils view risks to this mediumterm outlook for price developments are fully confirmed to lie on the upside
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Positive;0.49454599618911743;these risks include the possibility of further rises in oil and agricultural prices  continuing the strong momentum observed in recent months as well as increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those foreseen thus far
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9917078614234924;moreover taking into account the existence of capacity constraints the favourable momentum of real gdp growth observed over the past few quarters and the positive developments in labour markets stronger than currently expected wage growth may emerge
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Negative;0.7562282085418701;furthermore an increase in pricing power in market segments with low competition could materialise
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.8821301460266113;it is therefore crucial that all parties concerned meet their responsibilities and that secondround effects on wage and pricesetting stemming from recent commodity price rises be avoided
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.989905059337616;to that end any explicit or de facto indexation of nominal wages to prices should be eliminated
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.946990430355072;the monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longerterm horizons
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Positive;0.972329318523407;money and credit have both continued to grow vigorously in recent months
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.6400408148765564;the annual growth rate of m3 in october at 123 is likely to have been influenced by a number of temporary factors such as the flattening of the yield curve the financial market turmoil and specific transactions associated with the restructuring of certain banking groups
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9904776811599731;however even taking these special factors into account the underlying rate of monetary expansion remains strong
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Positive;0.974612295627594;moreover the sustained expansion of loans to the domestic private sector which grew at an annual rate of 112 in october points to the continued vigour of underlying monetary dynamics
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9740720391273499;monetary developments therefore continue to require very careful monitoring both to detect underlying trends associated with inflationary pressures at longer horizons and to better understand shorterterm dynamics
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.971123993396759;such monitoring will also provide a more complete picture of the response of the private sector to the increased volatility in financial markets
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9512377381324768;a broad assessment of underlying trends in money and credit growth is particularly important at present given recent financial market developments
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Negative;0.8774281740188599;heightened financial volatility may influence the shortterm behaviour of moneyholders and thereby complicate the extraction of the underlying trend monetary developments
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.8890215158462524;at the same time monetary and credit data can also offer an important insight into how financial institutions households and firms have responded to the financial market turmoil
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Negative;0.967821478843689;for the time being however there is little evidence that the financial market turbulence since early august has strongly influenced the dynamics of broad money and credit aggregates although specific balance sheet items such as holdings of money market fund sharesunits may have been affected
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Positive;0.8999490737915039;indeed the growth of bank loans to households and nonfinancial corporations has remained robust in recent months which may suggest that the supply of credit has not been impaired
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9809836745262146;further data and analysis will be required to develop a more complete view of the impact of the financial market developments on bank balance sheets financing conditions and money and credit growth
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9606742858886719;to sum up a crosscheck of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis fully confirms the assessment that there are upside risks to price stability over the medium term in a context of vigorous money and credit growth and against the background of sound economic fundamentals in the euro area
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Negative;0.9944576025009155;at the same time the reappraisal of risk in financial markets is still evolving and uncertainty about the potential impact on the real economy has continued
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9821255207061768;consequently the governing council will monitor very closely all developments
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.913724958896637;our monetary policy stands ready to counter upside risks to price stability as required by our mandate
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9868893623352051;in particular for the recent increase in inflation to remain temporary it is of the essence that no secondround effects materialise via an impact from current inflation rates on wage and pricesetting behaviour
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.6938357949256897;by acting in a firm and timely manner on the basis of our assessment we will ensure that secondround effects and risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise and that medium and longterm inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with price stability
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9354200959205627;this is all the more important in the current context
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Positive;0.7328131794929504;as regards the financial markets we will continue to pay great attention to developments over the coming weeks
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9915531277656555;turning to fiscal policy the european commissions autumn 2007 economic forecast generally confirms the picture of improving budget balances in the euro area this year
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Negative;0.9933486580848694;however progress with structural fiscal consolidation in countries with remaining budget imbalances is generally disappointing
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Negative;0.991827130317688;this lack of ambition unnecessarily prolongs the correction of remaining fiscal deficits and could lead to negative surprises should the macroeconomic environment turn less favourable
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9890636801719666;in this context member states should meet the commitment they made in the eurogroups berlin agreement of april 2007 namely that most euro area members would achieve their mediumterm objectives in 2008 or 2009 and all should aim for 2010 at the latest
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.5107782483100891;with regard to structural reforms it is important that governments continue their efforts to make progress
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9895495176315308;the improvements in the employment situation over recent years show the fruits of past reforms
2007-12-06;2007;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9669989943504333;it is essential that the reform momentum to enhance competition productivity growth and labour market flexibility is maintained and that there are no reversals of the reform process in the countries of the euro area
