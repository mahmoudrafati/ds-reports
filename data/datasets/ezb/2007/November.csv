2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9459799528121948;let me report on the outcome of our meeting which was also attended by commissioner almunia
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9924543499946594;on the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses we decided at todays meeting to leave the key ecb interest rates unchanged
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Positive;0.7486064434051514;the information that has become available since our previous meeting fully confirms that the outlook for price stability over the medium term is subject to upside risks
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Positive;0.7502683401107788;against this background and with money and credit growth vigorous in the euro area our monetary policy stands ready to counter upside risks to price stability as required by our mandate
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Negative;0.703720211982727;the economic fundamentals of the euro area remain sound and support a favourable mediumterm outlook for economic activity
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Negative;0.991878867149353;however the ongoing reappraisal of risk in financial markets has led to continued uncertainty
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Positive;0.8132866024971008;this warrants a thorough examination of additional information before drawing further conclusions for monetary policy in the context of our medium termoriented monetary policy strategy focused on maintaining price stability
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9814644455909729;accordingly the governing council will monitor very closely all developments
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Negative;0.4890762269496918;by acting in a firm and timely manner on the basis of our assessment we will ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise and that medium and longterm inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with price stability which is all the more important at times of financial market volatility and increased uncertainty
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9549660682678223;this will favour an environment conducive to sustained economic growth wellfunctioning markets and job creation
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Positive;0.564751923084259;as regards the financial markets we will continue to pay great attention to developments over the period to come
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9419136047363281;allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail starting with the economic analysis
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Positive;0.8592402338981628;on the basis of the available data it appears that the sustained real economic growth experienced in the euro area in the first half of 2007 has continued through the third quarter as reflected in the data for industrial production and retail sales that have been released since our meeting in early october
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9900985360145569;while financial market volatility seems to have contributed to a decline in euro area consumer and business confidence indicators in the past few months these indicators generally remain above their historical averages and continue to point to ongoing sustained growth
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9909494519233704;overall the fundamentals of the euro area remain sound including in particular sustained corporate earnings and profitability robust employment growth and falling unemployment to levels not seen for 25 years
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9128768444061279;available forecasts for 2008 continue to confirm our main scenario of real gdp growing at around trend potential
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9153661727905273;this scenario is based on the expectation that the global economy will remain resilient with the slowdown of economic growth in the united states partly offset by the sustained strength of emerging market economies
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9921430349349976;continued strong external demand should provide ongoing support to euro area exports and investment
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9918518662452698;consumption growth in the euro area should also contribute to economic growth in line with developments in real disposable income as continued employment growth provides supportive conditions
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9913235902786255;that said in view of the potential impact of prolonged financial market volatility and the repricing of risk on the real economy the level of uncertainty surrounding this broadly favourable outlook for economic activity remains high
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9822837710380554;on balance risks to the outlook for growth are judged to lie on the downside
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Negative;0.991675853729248;these downside risks relate mainly to the potential for a broader impact from the ongoing reappraisal of risk in financial markets on confidence and financing conditions further oil and commodity price rises as well as concerns about protectionist pressures and possible disorderly developments owing to global imbalances
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Positive;0.6666338443756104;as regards price developments according to eurostats flash estimate the annual hicp inflation rate increased very strongly to 26 in october 2007 from 21 in september
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8583330512046814;this sharp increase is a matter of particular concern and it is essential that it does not affect medium to longerterm inflation expectations
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9773964881896973;to that effect we have already indicated on previous occasions that we are now in a period during which unfavourable effects from energy prices will have a strong upward impact on annual hicp inflation rates owing mainly to the marked decline in energy prices a year ago
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9782198667526245;in addition these effects have been strengthened by recent substantial further increases in oil nonoil commodity and in particular food prices
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Positive;0.7670813798904419;overall we expect the hicp inflation rate to remain significantly above 2 in the coming months before moderating again in the course of 2008 risks to the mediumterm outlook for price developments are fully confirmed to lie on the upside
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Negative;0.7284525632858276;these risks include the possibility of persistently high oil and agricultural prices continuing the strong momentum observed in recent months as well as unanticipated increases in administered prices and indirect taxes
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9890797734260559;moreover taking into account the existence of capacity constraints the favourable momentum of real gdp growth observed over the past few quarters and the positive signs from labour markets stronger than currently expected wage developments may occur
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Negative;0.7562282085418701;furthermore an increase in pricing power in market segments with low competition could materialise
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9729253649711609;such developments would pose upward risks to price stability
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.844560980796814;it is therefore crucial that all parties concerned meet their responsibilities and that secondround effects be avoided
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9685433506965637;in addition the explicit or de facto indexation of nominal wages to prices should be reduced and ultimately eliminated
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.946990430355072;the monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longerterm horizons
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Positive;0.7036946415901184;the strength of both money and credit growth in recent months  with the annual growth rates of m3 and mfi loans to the private sector both at more than 11 in september  may have been influenced by a number of temporary or special factors such as the flattening of the yield curve and the recent financial market volatility
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Positive;0.991199791431427;however even taking into account these special factors the underlying rate of money and credit expansion remains strong
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9728379845619202;monetary developments therefore continue to require very careful monitoring so as to detect underlying trends on the one hand and to better understand shorterterm dynamics on the other
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.966397225856781;this monitoring will provide a more complete picture of the response of the private sector to the increased volatility in financial markets
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9675566554069519;a broad assessment of underlying trends in money and credit growth is particularly important given recent financial market developments since financial volatility may influence the shortterm behaviour of moneyholders and thereby affect monetary developments
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9194526672363281;monetary and credit data can therefore offer an important insight into how financial institutions households and firms have responded to the financial market volatility
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9783353209495544;indeed previous episodes of heightened financial market uncertainty have been associated with large portfolio shifts into safe and liquid monetary assets
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.774164617061615;for the time being however there is little evidence that such shifts have influenced the dynamics of broad money and credit aggregates since the onset of financial market volatility in early august although specific balance sheet items such as holdings of money market fund sharesunits may have been strongly affected
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9050067663192749;the rate of growth of bank loans to households and nonfinancial corporations has remained robust in recent months tentatively suggesting that there is no impairment in credit supply
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Positive;0.953051745891571;however it cannot be excluded that the strong loan flows partly reflect the reintermediation of some financing onto bank balance sheets given illiquidity in some segments of the assetbacked securities markets
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9820876717567444;further data and analysis will be required to develop a more complete view of the impact of the financial market volatility on bank balance sheets financing conditions and money and credit growth
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Positive;0.96518874168396;to sum up a crosscheck of the information identified under the economic analysis with the outcome of the monetary analysis has fully confirmed the existence of upside risks to price stability over the medium term with money and credit growth vigorous in the euro area and against the background of sound economic fundamentals in the euro area
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9786699414253235;at the same time given the continued uncertainty additional information is needed before further conclusions for monetary policy can be drawn
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9821255207061768;consequently the governing council will monitor very closely all developments
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.913724958896637;our monetary policy stands ready to counter upside risks to price stability as required by our mandate
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8670549392700195;by acting in a firm and timely manner on the basis of our assessment we will ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise and that medium and longterm inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with price stability which is all the more important in the current context
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Positive;0.564751923084259;as regards the financial markets we will continue to pay great attention to developments over the period to come
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Positive;0.917595624923706;turning to fiscal policy the governing council welcomes the ecofin councils agreement to strengthen the preventive arm of the stability and growth pact
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Positive;0.5777667760848999;the governing council also welcomes the recent confirmation by the ecofin council of a reinforcement of its commitment to the full implementation of the pact
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9835350513458252;in particular the provisions of the preventive arm including the call for a structural adjustment of at least 05 of gdp per annum need to be adhered to by all countries with fiscal imbalances
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9879647493362427;in this regard 2008 budget plans in a number of countries point to a procyclical fiscal stance and an unwarranted relaxation of consolidation efforts
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9909008741378784;this gives rise to concern as consolidation shortfalls undermine in particular the eurogroup agreement to achieve sound budgetary positions by 2010 at the latest
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9839162230491638;with regard to structural reforms the governing council stresses that a key effect of welldesigned structural reforms is a sustainable improvement in the employment and income situation of workers and households
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9835968613624573;reforms which increase the incentives for firms and individuals to invest in human capital tend to enhance overall labour demand and productivity
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9820066094398499;reducing nonwage labour costs would also enhance employment and the net income levels of workers
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9432269930839539;moreover labour market regulations should not discourage firms from offering jobs or workers from accepting them
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Negative;0.6355739831924438;it is encouraging to see that past labour market reforms have contributed to job creation and reduced unemployment
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.7760254144668579;it is important that governments continue in this direction and do not reverse past reforms just at the point when they are starting to bear fruit
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8178577423095703;moreover the governing council reiterates its full support for all efforts which foster market flexibility and enhance competition
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9802144765853882;this also applies to the agricultural markets
2007-11-08;2007;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9860301613807678;against the background of a marked increase in international food commodity prices further liberalisation and reforms in eu agricultural markets would help to enhance their efficiency and benefit european consumers through lower prices
