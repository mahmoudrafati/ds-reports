2007-05-10;2007;May;REPORT;Negative;0.793487012386322;these relate notably to the increasing capacity utilisation in the euro area economy the possibility of further oil price rises and additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those announced and decided thus far
2007-05-10;2007;May;REPORT;Positive;0.6316770911216736;more fundamentally stronger than currently expected wage developments could pose significant upward risks to price stability not least in view of the favourable momentum in labour markets observed over the past few quarters

2007-05-10;2007;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9518749117851257;it is crucial that the social partners meet their responsibilities so as to continue to avoid wage developments that would eventually lead to inflationary pressures and harm the purchasing power of all euro area citizens
2007-05-10;2007;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.7463198304176331;in this context it is also important to point out that wage agreements should be sufficiently differentiated and take into account price competitiveness positions the still high level of unemployment in many economies and productivity developments across sectors
2007-05-10;2007;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9430916905403137;the monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer horizons
2007-05-10;2007;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9907028675079346;the underlying rate of monetary expansion remains strong in a context of already ample liquidity

2007-05-10;2007;May;REPORT;Positive;0.4295075833797455;looking through such transitory aspects there are however several indications that higher shortterm interest rates are influencing monetary dynamics although they have not as yet significantly dampened the overall strength of these dynamics
2007-05-10;2007;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9823901653289795;for example increases in shortterm rates have served to moderate the expansion of the narrow aggregate m1 in recent quarters but its annual growth is still robust

2007-05-10;2007;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9901978969573975;in this environment monetary developments continue to require very careful monitoring particularly against the background of a solid expansion in economic activity and still strong property market developments

2007-05-10;2007;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9871731996536255;the relevant horizon for monetary policy is the medium term

2007-05-10;2007;May;REPORT;Positive;0.4221726357936859;given the vigorous monetary and credit growth in an environment of already ample liquidity a crosscheck of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis supports the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium to longer term
2007-05-10;2007;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9613538980484009;accordingly the governing council will continue to be strongly vigilant in order to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise
2007-05-10;2007;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9884417057037354;this will support the solid anchoring of medium to longerterm inflation expectations in the euro area at levels consistent with price stability

2007-05-10;2007;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.891727864742279;this would allow euro area countries to prepare themselves for less favourable economic conditions

2007-05-10;2007;May;REPORT;Positive;0.8986802101135254;it is important that this favourable trend in labour markets continues so contributing to a prolonged and robust upswing
2007-05-10;2007;May;REPORT;Positive;0.7940723896026611;in this respect sufficient wage differentiation is required so as to improve employment opportunities for less skilled workers and in sectors and regions with high unemployment
2007-05-10;2007;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9512878060340881;furthermore the removal of impediments to labour mobility would help to address local imbalances in labour markets and to enhance the adjustment flexibility of euro area economies to economic shocks
