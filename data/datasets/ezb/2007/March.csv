2007-03-08;2007;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9892338514328003;at todays meeting we decided to raise the key ecb interest rates by 25 basis points
2007-03-08;2007;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9826475977897644;this decision was taken in view of the upside risks to price stability over the medium term that we have identified through both our economic and monetary analyses
2007-03-08;2007;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9630575776100159;todays decision will contribute to ensuring that medium to longerterm inflation expectations in the euro area remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability

2007-03-08;2007;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8964850902557373;therefore looking ahead acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term is warranted
2007-03-08;2007;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9793334603309631;the governing council will monitor very closely all developments so that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise

2007-03-08;2007;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.792219340801239;our current assessment is that the quarterly profile of real gdp growth is likely to be somewhat smoother in response to the impact of indirect tax changes in one large euro area country than had originally been anticipated
2007-03-08;2007;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9923954010009766;the strength of real gdp growth in the fourth quarter is thus indicative of ongoing robust growth in the euro area
2007-03-08;2007;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9864851236343384;both domestic demand and exports made significant contributions to real gdp growth confirming the sustained and broadbased nature of the current expansion
2007-03-08;2007;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9466232657432556;the information on economic activity from various confidence surveys and indicatorbased estimates supports the assessment that robust economic growth has continued into 2007 looking ahead the mediumterm outlook for economic activity remains favourable
2007-03-08;2007;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9419371485710144;the conditions are in place for the euro area economy to grow solidly
2007-03-08;2007;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9377151131629944;as regards the external environment global economic growth has become more balanced across regions and while moderating somewhat remains robust supported in part by lower oil prices
2007-03-08;2007;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9776949286460876;external conditions thus provide support for euro area exports
2007-03-08;2007;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9923896193504333;domestic demand in the euro area is also expected to maintain its relatively strong momentum
2007-03-08;2007;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9913383722305298;investment should remain dynamic benefiting from an extended period of very favourable financing conditions balance sheet restructuring accumulated and ongoing strong corporate earnings and gains in business efficiency
2007-03-08;2007;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9929327964782715;consumption should also strengthen further over time in line with developments in real disposable income as employment conditions continue to improve
2007-03-08;2007;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9719940423965454;this outlook is also reflected in the new ecb staff macroeconomic projections
2007-03-08;2007;March;REPORT;Positive;0.7959040999412537;the projections foresee average annual real gdp growth in a range between 21 and 29 in 2007 and between 19 and 29 in 2008 in comparison with the december eurosystem staff projections the ranges projected for real gdp growth in 2007 and 2008 have been revised upwards largely reflecting the strength of gdp growth in the second half of 2006 and the lower energy prices which if sustained would have a positive impact on real disposable income
2007-03-08;2007;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9767727255821228;in the governing councils view the risks surrounding this favourable outlook for economic growth are broadly balanced over the shorter term
2007-03-08;2007;March;REPORT;Negative;0.8712846040725708;at longer horizons risks lie mainly on the downside
2007-03-08;2007;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9852707386016846;the main risks relate to the possibility of a renewed increase in oil prices fears of a rise in protectionist pressures and concerns about possible disorderly developments owing to global imbalances
2007-03-08;2007;March;REPORT;Negative;0.8737526535987854;as regards price developments according to eurostats flash estimate annual hicp inflation was 18 in february 2007 unchanged from january 2007 the fall in headline inflation rates since the summer of 2006 has been predominantly due to lower energy prices
2007-03-08;2007;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9672284722328186;looking ahead last years volatility in energy prices will lead to significant base effects affecting the profile of annual inflation rates this year
2007-03-08;2007;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9676657319068909;on the basis of the current level of oil prices and oil price futures annual inflation rates are likely to fall during the spring and summer before rising again towards the end of the year and then most likely hovering again at around 2
2007-03-08;2007;March;REPORT;Negative;0.8353345990180969;the new ecb staff macroeconomic projections foresee annual hicp inflation averaging between 15 and 21 in 2007 and between 14 and 26 in 2008 compared with the december 2006 eurosystem staff projections the upper bound of the range projected for inflation in 2007 is somewhat lower largely reflecting the fall in oil prices
2007-03-08;2007;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9781736731529236;by contrast the projected range for inflation in 2008 is slightly higher largely on account of the anticipated stronger economic growth which could exert more intense pressure on factor utilisation and factor costs
2007-03-08;2007;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9356358647346497;in this context let me remind you of the conditional nature of these projections which are based on a series of technical assumptions including market expectations for future short and longterm interest rates as well as for oil and nonenergy commodity prices
2007-03-08;2007;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.529888391494751;at the policyrelevant mediumterm horizon the outlook for price developments remains in the governing councils view subject to upside risks
2007-03-08;2007;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.7424666285514832;these relate to the possibility of renewed oil price increases and additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those announced and decided thus far
2007-03-08;2007;March;REPORT;Negative;0.5088275074958801;more fundamentally stronger than currently expected wage developments would pose significant upward risks to price stability not least in view of the favourable momentum of real gdp growth observed over the past few quarters
2007-03-08;2007;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.41268405318260193;it is therefore crucial that the social partners continue to meet their responsibilities
2007-03-08;2007;March;REPORT;Positive;0.630834698677063;in this context wage agreements should take into account price competitiveness positions the still high level of unemployment in many economies as well as productivity developments
2007-03-08;2007;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9886052012443542;the governing council will monitor the upcoming wage negotiations in the euro area countries very carefully
2007-03-08;2007;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9430916905403137;the monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer horizons
2007-03-08;2007;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9674031138420105;annual m3 growth was unchanged at 98 in january thus remaining at the highest rate observed since the introduction of the euro
2007-03-08;2007;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9911565780639648;at 106 the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector also remained strong in january
2007-03-08;2007;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9911705255508423;strong growth in private sector credit reflects the continuation of the upward trend in the growth of borrowing by nonfinancial corporations seen since mid2004
2007-03-08;2007;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9928814172744751;meanwhile in the context of rising mortgage rates throughout the euro area and a slowing increase in house prices in some regions the growth of household borrowing has shown some further signs of moderation in recent months albeit remaining at still high rates
2007-03-08;2007;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9792202711105347;taking the appropriate medium to longerterm perspective for assessing trends in money and credit growth the latest developments confirm the continuation of a persistent upward trend in the underlying rate of monetary expansion
2007-03-08;2007;March;REPORT;Positive;0.8709598779678345;following several years of robust monetary growth the liquidity situation in the euro area is ample by all plausible measures
2007-03-08;2007;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9921877384185791;the robust expansion of money and credit reflects the accommodative monetary policy stance over a prolonged period of time and the strengthening of economic activity in the euro area
2007-03-08;2007;March;REPORT;Positive;0.8625317811965942;in an environment of ample liquidity it points to upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term
2007-03-08;2007;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9920342564582825;monetary developments therefore continue to require very careful monitoring particularly against the background of a solid expansion in economic activity and continued strong property market developments in many parts of the euro area
2007-03-08;2007;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.983992874622345;to sum up in assessing price trends it is important to look through any shortterm volatility in inflation rates
2007-03-08;2007;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9871731996536255;the relevant horizon for monetary policy is the medium term
2007-03-08;2007;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9916496276855469;risks to the mediumterm outlook for price stability remain on the upside relating in particular to stronger than currently expected wage developments in a context of robust ongoing growth in employment and economic activity
2007-03-08;2007;March;REPORT;Positive;0.4221726357936859;given the vigorous monetary and credit growth in an environment of already ample liquidity a crosscheck of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis supports the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium to longer term
2007-03-08;2007;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9586382508277893;the governing council will continue to monitor very closely all developments so that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise
2007-03-08;2007;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9884417057037354;this will support the solid anchoring of medium to longerterm inflation expectations in the euro area at levels consistent with price stability
2007-03-08;2007;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.6089648008346558;therefore looking ahead acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term remains warranted
2007-03-08;2007;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9920027256011963;as regards fiscal policy there is growing confirmation that the favourable cyclical developments led to better than expected budgetary outcomes in 2006 in a number of countries and in the euro area as a whole
2007-03-08;2007;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.7886765003204346;however updated stability programmes foresee only moderate progress with fiscal consolidation in the coming years
2007-03-08;2007;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9606706500053406;in this respect some countries consolidation targets appear not fully in line with the requirements of the revised stability and growth pact
2007-03-08;2007;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9781692028045654;risks stem in particular from a lack of wellspecified and credible measures notably on the expenditure side of budgets
2007-03-08;2007;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9257563948631287;given the favourable economic environment the governing council considers it essential that procyclical policies are avoided in all euro area countries and that sufficiently ambitious fiscal consolidation efforts are made in the countries with remaining budgetary imbalances andor high public debt outstanding
2007-03-08;2007;March;REPORT;Positive;0.8996419310569763;the opportunity should be seized to attain sound public finances within the programme horizons and by 2010 at the latest in all euro area countries
2007-03-08;2007;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9558254480361938;fiscal consolidation that is part of a mediumtermoriented credible and expenditurebased reform strategy would support longerterm output and employment growth and help prepare for the fiscal impact of population ageing
2007-03-08;2007;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9695551991462708;as regards structural reforms the european council will discuss the current state of and future progress in the implementation of the lisbon strategy at its meeting which starts today
2007-03-08;2007;March;REPORT;Positive;0.989828884601593;it is positive to see that reforms and moderate increases in labour costs have helped to bring about higher employment and lower unemployment in recent years although progress has been uneven across eu member states
2007-03-08;2007;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9826545119285583;we encourage action to create incentives and structures which support the integration of all groups into the labour market including those for which employment rates have been relatively low in the past
2007-03-08;2007;March;REPORT;Positive;0.8954088091850281;reforms of tax and benefit systems should enhance incentives to work and to create jobs
2007-03-08;2007;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9061533808708191;reducing labour taxes including social security contributions and thereby labour costs would support employment while setting minimum wages at a level not in line with productivity reduces the employment chances of less skilled workers
2007-03-08;2007;March;REPORT;Positive;0.8475398421287537;we fully support policies to improve education and the adoption of technological innovations in order to raise productivity growth
