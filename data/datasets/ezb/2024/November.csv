2024-11-14;2024;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9936571717262268;a large persistent undershooting of the 2 inflation target requiring a sustained policy response remained unlikely
2024-11-14;2024;November;REPORT;Negative;0.98590487241745;this was mainly because structural inflationary trends such as geopolitical fragmentation and climate change were likely to lead to more frequent adverse supply shocks
2024-11-14;2024;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9087604880332947;such a scenario of undershooting probably required a combination of factors that were not yet present
2024-11-14;2024;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9930566549301147;these included disappointing economic growth that moved into recessionary territory a weakening in the financial system wage pressures fading away and a downward shift in inflation expectations
2024-11-14;2024;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9928060173988342;by contrast it was also suggested that the change in the inflation outlook had been more significant with recent downside surprises and rapid changes in market expectations pointing to an increasing risk of undershooting the target in the course of 2025 possibly in a sustained manner especially if wage growth moderated substantially
2024-11-14;2024;November;REPORT;Negative;0.8803346157073975;this could now be seen as a greater risk than overshooting the targetturning to underlying inflation members noted that most measures had either declined or were unchanged
2024-11-14;2024;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9568610787391663;domestic inflation was still elevated as wage pressures in the euro area remained strong
2024-11-14;2024;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9855419397354126;at the same time it was important to consider the full range of underlying inflation indicators
2024-11-14;2024;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9822078347206116;of these only domestic inflation remained substantially above 2 while the pcci was firmly anchored at 2
2024-11-14;2024;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9771489500999451;there was also a case for placing greater emphasis on more forwardlooking indicators of underlying inflation
2024-11-14;2024;November;REPORT;Negative;0.572913408279419;core inflation had fallen in september although it remained relatively high and there was still fairly limited progress in its overall recent trendthe developments in domestic and core inflation were partly linked to persistently high services inflation
2024-11-14;2024;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9033891558647156;nevertheless there had recently been some positive signs which could suggest that the worst had passed
2024-11-14;2024;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.4959613084793091;for example for the first time since the surge in inflation little or no incremental price inflation had been recorded in services when base effects were excluded and services inflation momentum was declining albeit from high levels
2024-11-14;2024;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9912286996841431;it was argued however that more readings would be needed for a clearer picture and that key data confirming a significant decline in domestic and services inflation would only arrive in the first half of 2025 labour cost dynamics would also continue to be a key concern for domestic inflation and wage pressures needed to be carefully monitored
2024-11-14;2024;November;REPORT;Negative;0.966497540473938;despite slight declines wage growth was still elevated and was expected to remain high and volatile for the rest of the year given the significant role of oneoff payments and the staggered nature of wage adjustments
2024-11-14;2024;November;REPORT;Positive;0.6847335696220398;at the same time labour cost pressures were set to continue easing gradually with wage growth likely to moderate and profits partially buffering their impact on overall inflation
2024-11-14;2024;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9911860823631287;again it was stressed that key data confirming a significant deceleration in wage growth and unit labour costs would likely only arrive in 2025 also in view of disappointing productivity growthfinally members generally agreed that monetary policy transmission from the past tightening continued to dampen economic activity even though some signs of easing were already starting to be visible as restrictiveness was gradually but progressively withdrawn
2024-11-14;2024;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9937798380851746;financing conditions remained restrictive and continued to weigh overall on consumption and investment and this exerted downward pressure on growth and inflation
2024-11-14;2024;November;REPORT;Negative;0.8971839547157288;at the same time with the recent easing in monetary and financial conditions and the recent decline in expected real interest rates across much of the maturity spectrum the policy stance might be approaching the estimated neutral territory earlier than previously thoughtit was underlined that transmission from past monetary tightening was ongoing owing to various lags even as the first effects of easing materialised
2024-11-14;2024;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9570797681808472;many holders of fixed rate mortgages for example had not yet seen their interest rates increase
2024-11-14;2024;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.7312988638877869;however mortgage payments were still set to go up even if interest rates were now falling in aggregate because the mortgages had been taken out when interest rates were very low
2024-11-14;2024;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9137667417526245;it was suggested that savings might have been more responsive to interest rates than implied by models estimated on the small changes observed in the past whereas the increases in interest rates had been very large and rapid to counter the recent inflation surge
2024-11-14;2024;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9939093589782715;it was also argued that high interest rates continued to weigh on investment even with longerterm real interest rates now in neutral territory
2024-11-14;2024;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9939290285110474;in this context continuing restrictiveness at the short end of the yield curve could be dampening aggregate demand by more than implied by models
2024-11-14;2024;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9262465834617615;finally it was emphasised that the strength of monetary policy transmission interacted with the weakness of the economy for example making banks more reluctant to lendat the same time the gradually fading effects of restrictive monetary policy were expected to support consumption and investment in the future
2024-11-14;2024;November;REPORT;Positive;0.981947660446167;there were also initial signs that the recent easing of monetary policy restriction and the anticipation of more to come were starting to be transmitted to the economy in the interest ratesensitive housing sector in line with its quick responsiveness to the start of the hiking cycle in 2022 looking ahead other cyclical components such as the construction sector would probably be supported and demand more generally should be boosted by the easing of financial conditions while manufacturing sectors facing structural challenges were unlikely to benefit as much
2024-11-14;2024;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.982451856136322;still the recent easing of restriction would need time to work its way through the economy and the lagged effects from past rate hikes would extend beyond the end of 2024monetary policy decisions and communicationagainst this background members considered the proposal by mr lane to lower the three key ecb interest rates by 25 basis points
2024-11-14;2024;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9941310286521912;in particular based on the updated assessment of the inflation outlook the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission it was now appropriate to take another step in moderating the degree of monetary policy restriction by lowering the deposit facility rate  the rate through which the governing council steered the monetary policy stance
2024-11-14;2024;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9771991968154907;the incoming information on inflation had shown that the disinflationary process was well on track
2024-11-14;2024;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9663479924201965;there was increasing confidence that inflation would converge to the 2 mediumterm inflation target in a timely manner

2024-11-14;2024;November;REPORT;Negative;0.7976849675178528;the latest reading was seen as a continuation of a sequence while it was contended that the fall in september mainly linked to lower energy prices was insufficient by itself to justify a rate cut
2024-11-14;2024;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9838364720344543;wage growth had been evolving broadly in line with the projections
2024-11-14;2024;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9018840193748474;there were also initial signs of improvement in services inflation as well as indications that services and domestic inflation would decline materially in the coming year
2024-11-14;2024;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9871675372123718;among measures of underlying inflation only domestic inflation continued to be substantially above 2
2024-11-14;2024;November;REPORT;Positive;0.8868321180343628;comfort could also be drawn from the recent performance and stability of the staff inflation projections which had improved over the past year
2024-11-14;2024;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.6512085199356079;in addition inflation expectations across a range of measures were well anchored at about 2
2024-11-14;2024;November;REPORT;Negative;0.98628169298172;at the same time it was still too early to declare victory in the fight against inflation especially since the main decline in services inflation and wage growth had yet to materialise
2024-11-14;2024;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.89045649766922;it was also important to see a configuration of wages productivity growth and profit margins that was consistent with not only reaching the 2 target but also staying there sustainably
2024-11-14;2024;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9532164335250854;the inflation outlook had been affected by recent downside surprises in indicators of economic activity and it was regarded as important that monetary policy fulfil its primary objective of price stability without harming the real economy by more than was necessary
2024-11-14;2024;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9936461448669434;in this context it was maintained that the weaker growth outlook primarily reflected structural rather than cyclical demand factors outside the realm of monetary policy
2024-11-14;2024;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9817669987678528;risk management considerations were widely seen as a key element supporting a decision to cut interest rates at the current meeting
2024-11-14;2024;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9488043785095215;in particular if the slowdown signalled by indicators of economic activity and the downside surprise to inflation proved to be temporary a decision to cut rates now could ex post turn out as merely having brought forward a december cut
2024-11-14;2024;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9320558309555054;as such there was little risk associated with cutting especially given that interest rates would remain in restrictive territory and continue to support the disinflationary process
2024-11-14;2024;November;REPORT;Positive;0.8832263946533203;by contrast if the recent data signalled a more persistent weakness which confirmed a stronger disinflationary process cutting today would be justified as a timely adjustment of policy to changing macroeconomic conditions
2024-11-14;2024;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9396414756774902;this reasoning also meant that the risks from cutting at the present meeting and potentially being too early were lower than the risks of waiting and potentially acting too late
2024-11-14;2024;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9879186749458313;as such it was also contended that acting now could provide insurance against downside risks that could lead to an undershooting of the target further ahead and would support a soft landing
2024-11-14;2024;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9802660346031189;furthermore the point was made that a decision to cut interest rates now was a response to the materialisation of the downside risks identified in the past rather than to prevailing or new risksagainst this background all members supported the proposal by mr lane to reduce the degree of monetary policy restriction through a third 25 basis point rate cut
2024-11-14;2024;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9938684105873108;this was a datadriven decision justified by a wide range of indicators of the inflation outlook pointing in the same direction
2024-11-14;2024;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9867331385612488;moreover it reflected an interpretation of these data trends and continuity with respect to previous cutting decisions rather than a dependence on any individual data point
2024-11-14;2024;November;REPORT;Negative;0.524571418762207;it was also consistent with the policy considerations put forward at the previous meeting which had highlighted that the governing council might decide to move more quickly should the data come in weaker than anticipated
2024-11-14;2024;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9655123949050903;a few members initially expressed a view that they would have preferred to accrue more information and to wait until december when a comprehensive assessment of the mediumterm outlook for inflation was available
2024-11-14;2024;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9681941270828247;however these members could see the precautionary risk management case for cutting now and thus expressed their readiness to support the proposallooking ahead members emphasised that they remained determined to ensure that inflation would return to the 2 mediumterm target in a timely manner and that they would keep policy rates sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary to achieve this aim
2024-11-14;2024;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9906287789344788;they would also continue to follow a datadependent and meetingbymeeting approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction

2024-11-14;2024;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.984529972076416;it was underlined that the speed at which the degree of restrictiveness should be reduced depended on the evolution of incoming data which should continue to be evaluated against all three of the established elements of the reaction function
2024-11-14;2024;November;REPORT;Negative;0.7569290399551392;in particular the materialisation of different risk factors could either accelerate or decelerate the disinflationary process
