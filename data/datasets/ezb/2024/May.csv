2024-05-10;2024;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9847868084907532;while there had been some signs of stabilisation in credit conditions at a restrictive level further weak credit data were suggesting that the credit channel of monetary policy transmission was more powerful than previously expected

2024-05-10;2024;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9791087508201599;with inflation declining and a delayed pickup in economic growth it was regarded as important to assess how restrictive the monetary policy stance was as a basis for future monetary policy decisions
2024-05-10;2024;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9654198288917542;it was underlined that there was considerable uncertainty about the degree of restrictiveness of the ecbs monetary policy stance both measured against unobservable concepts like the neutral rate of interest and judged by the transmission lags to the capital labour and goods markets in the real economy and ultimately to inflationone way of assessing the restrictiveness of monetary policy was to evaluate the level of policy rates relative to available modelbased estimates of the natural or neutral rate of interest
2024-05-10;2024;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9281994104385376;in this context it was argued that ongoing structural changes might have led to an increase in such benchmark rates
2024-05-10;2024;May;REPORT;Positive;0.80470210313797;these changes included the anticipation of the significant global investment needs to address climate change and the green transition geopolitical shifts and trade fragmentation leading to deglobalisation and advances in artificial intelligence and digitalisation

2024-05-10;2024;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.8611506223678589;moreover policy rates were seen as likely to remain in restrictive territory for some time while the effects of the present restrictive policy stance would continue to be felt even after the start of the easing phase

2024-05-10;2024;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9891981482505798;the risk of undershooting the inflation target and eventually having to pay too high a price in terms of declining activity was now seen as being at least as high as the risk of acting too early and overshooting the target over the medium term
2024-05-10;2024;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9161744713783264;all in all a broad consensus emerged whereby members agreed it was prudent to wait until the next monetary policy meeting to see further evidence of and gain sufficient confidence in a timely and sustained return of inflation to target
2024-05-10;2024;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9774086475372314;compared with the outlook in march no major surprise had been observed that would justify action at the present meeting
2024-05-10;2024;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.987015962600708;conversely as long as the available data continued to confirm the projections looking ahead the policy path underlying the projections was seen as broadly consistent with a return of inflation to target in the medium term
2024-05-10;2024;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9807612895965576;members stressed the value of waiting until june for further evidence confirming or indicating a change to the outlook but also the value of taking into account any existing or new risks materialising by june including renewed risks to inflation posed by a possible escalation of geopolitical tensions
2024-05-10;2024;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.978522002696991;the next projections in june would allow a more comprehensive analysis of the main risks and their implications for price stability

2024-05-10;2024;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.5549485087394714;data dependence meant not overly focusing on one data point as the path many indicators took was likely to be bumpy
