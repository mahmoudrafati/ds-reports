2024-08-22;2024;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9617339372634888;this supported a pause at the current meeting
2024-08-22;2024;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9662656188011169;such a cautious approach was particularly warranted given the prevailing uncertainties about the evolution of wages profits productivity and services inflation
2024-08-22;2024;August;REPORT;Positive;0.9061679840087891;all of these would need further monitoring and assessment as new data arrived in order to gain further confidence in the inflation outlook

2024-08-22;2024;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9608865976333618;a cautious approach would also allow the governing council to respond by following a more gradual path of reducing policy rates if inflation was more persistent than currently foreseen
