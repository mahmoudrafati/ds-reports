2004-12-02;2004;December;REPORT;Negative;0.9812796115875244;downside risks to these projections stem in particular from potentially unfavourable developments in the oil market
2004-12-02;2004;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9141872525215149;in order to limit such risks secondround effects in wage and pricesetting must be avoided and fiscal authorities should refrain from taking measures which would prolong or distort the necessary adjustment process

2004-12-02;2004;December;REPORT;Negative;0.5155618786811829;looking further ahead however the information available so far indicates that hicp inflation would fall below 2 in the course of 2005 if no further adverse shocks occurred and it does not suggest that stronger underlying inflationary pressures are building up in the euro area
2004-12-02;2004;December;REPORT;Negative;0.8655910491943359;wage increases have remained contained over recent quarters and in the context of ongoing moderate growth and weak labour markets this trend should continue in the future

2004-12-02;2004;December;REPORT;Negative;0.9647220969200134;the latest monetary data confirm that the downward trend in annual m3 growth observed from the middle of 2003 has not continued in recent months and has even reversed
2004-12-02;2004;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.7075539231300354;over the course of 2004 monetary dynamics have been driven by two opposing forces
2004-12-02;2004;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9829214215278625;on the one hand the historically very low level of interest rates in the euro area has stimulated m3 dynamics in particular demand for the most liquid components of m3 contained in the narrow aggregate m1
2004-12-02;2004;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9513772130012512;on the other hand portfolio allocation behaviour has tended to normalise over the past year following the exceptionally strong preference for liquidity observed during the period of heightened economic and financial uncertainty between 2001 and mid2003
2004-12-02;2004;December;REPORT;Negative;0.762124240398407;however investors preference for liquid assets seems to have remained greater than would typically be expected at the current stage of the economic cycle possibly due to the fact that the economic and financial uncertainties in recent years have been relatively strong and protracted
2004-12-02;2004;December;REPORT;Negative;0.79799485206604;the very low level of interest rates is also fuelling private sector demand for credit
2004-12-02;2004;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9927607774734497;in particular the demand for loans for house purchase has continued to be robust supported also by strong house price dynamics in several euro area countries

2004-12-02;2004;December;REPORT;Negative;0.9825124740600586;this could pose risks to price stability over the medium term
2004-12-02;2004;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9310886859893799;to sum up the economic analysis suggests that underlying domestic inflationary pressures are contained but a number of mediumterm upside risks to price stability need to be monitored closely
2004-12-02;2004;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.5996671915054321;crosschecking with the monetary analysis supports the case for continued vigilance with regard to the materialisation of risks to price stability over the medium term
2004-12-02;2004;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.8586813807487488;it is of the essence to avoid any spillover from shortterm consumer price developments to longterm inflation expectations
2004-12-02;2004;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9891633987426758;as regards fiscal policies forthcoming budgets and stability programmes should send strong and confidencebuilding signals namely that sound public finances and growthfriendly structural adjustments in public finances are being pursued

2004-12-02;2004;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9659098386764526;the pact and the excessive deficit procedure should be fully respected in their current form while their implementation could be improved in particular as regards the preventive arm of the pact

2004-12-02;2004;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9885268211364746;progress in this direction will not only enhance the underlying growth potential of the euro area economy over the medium term but will also help to bolster consumer and business confidence over a shorter horizon
