2004-07-01;2004;July;REPORT;Positive;0.49044346809387207;while somewhat stronger inflationary pressure is likely to persist over the short term the outlook still remains in line with price stability over the medium term
2004-07-01;2004;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9889763593673706;therefore the governing council decided to retain its monetary policy stance leaving the key ecb interest rates unchanged
2004-07-01;2004;July;REPORT;Negative;0.49311164021492004;by historical standards interest rates are low both in nominal and in real terms also lending support to economic activity
2004-07-01;2004;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9646196365356445;the governing council will remain vigilant with regard to all developments which could affect the risks to price stability over the medium term
2004-07-01;2004;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9354288578033447;let me now explain our assessment in more detail turning first to the economic analysis
2004-07-01;2004;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9904691576957703;following quarterly real gdp growth of 06 in the first quarter of this year the latest data releases confirm that the economic recovery in the euro area is continuing
2004-07-01;2004;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9792711734771729;all in all the latest indicators of output and expenditure as well as the most recent survey data remain consistent with ongoing growth in real activity during the second quarter
2004-07-01;2004;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9863611459732056;looking ahead we remain confident that the recovery of economic activity will continue
2004-07-01;2004;July;REPORT;Positive;0.49892252683639526;the conditions for a broadening and strengthening of the recovery are in place
2004-07-01;2004;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9917729496955872;on the external side economic growth outside the euro area remains strong which should promote euro area exports
2004-07-01;2004;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9919889569282532;on the domestic side investment should benefit from the positive external environment and the favourable financing conditions within the euro area
2004-07-01;2004;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9921560287475586;as corporate restructuring gathers pace and business efficiency advances the resulting improvements in profits should further underpin business investment
2004-07-01;2004;July;REPORT;Positive;0.991771399974823;moreover the recovery of private consumption should proceed in line with increases in real disposable income and the anticipated subsequent strengthening of employment growth
2004-07-01;2004;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9887828230857849;available forecasts from international and private organisations paint a broadly similar picture of the outlook for the euro area
2004-07-01;2004;July;REPORT;Positive;0.5701367855072021;the expectation of a continued economic recovery is also in line with recent developments in financial markets
2004-07-01;2004;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.940456748008728;of course this scenario of an ongoing economic recovery may be influenced by a number of factors working in opposite directions
2004-07-01;2004;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9917691946029663;on the upside euro area growth in the first quarter was stronger than anticipated and this momentum may strengthen shorterterm dynamics
2004-07-01;2004;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9922367930412292;ongoing robust growth in the global economy could also lead to stronger than expected activity in the euro area
2004-07-01;2004;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9926204681396484;on the downside despite having declined somewhat oil prices remain at high levels and may largely through their impact on the euro areas terms of trade dampen growth
2004-07-01;2004;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9917083382606506;furthermore over longer horizons there are concerns relating to the persistence of global imbalances
2004-07-01;2004;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9628225564956665;turning to price developments there is a need to distinguish between shortterm developments and the mediumterm trend when assessing risks to price stability
2004-07-01;2004;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9897961020469666;over the short term oil prices continue to exert upward pressure on the general price level
2004-07-01;2004;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9888045191764832;according to eurostats flash estimate annual hicp inflation was 24 in june having stood at 25 in may
2004-07-01;2004;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9700904488563538;although oil prices have fallen over the last weeks markets expect them to remain high for some time
2004-07-01;2004;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9076990485191345;were this to occur inflation rates would most likely remain above 2 for longer than previously expected
2004-07-01;2004;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.97878497838974;looking beyond the short term however the outlook remains consistent with price stability provided that wages develop moderately in line with the latest evidence available
2004-07-01;2004;July;REPORT;Negative;0.976732075214386;nevertheless there are some upside risks to price stability
2004-07-01;2004;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9717674851417542;the strength of global economic dynamism may continue to exert upward pressure on commodity prices including oil prices
2004-07-01;2004;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9641019701957703;moreover following rather strong increases in the past the further evolution of indirect taxes and administered prices is difficult to incorporate into any forwardlooking assessment at this point in time because such information usually becomes available only later in the year
2004-07-01;2004;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9696853160858154;against this background the potential risk of secondround effects via wage and pricing behaviour needs to be monitored closely
2004-07-01;2004;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8273827433586121;social partners can make an important contribution to facilitating the maintenance of price stability by focusing on the mediumterm outlook for price developments rather than on currently observed rates of inflation
2004-07-01;2004;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.3973977863788605;this would also be conducive to fostering employment growth
2004-07-01;2004;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9386497735977173;finally measures of longterm inflation expectations derived from financial market indicators remain relatively high
2004-07-01;2004;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8181924223899841;while these indicators should be interpreted with caution their development calls for particular vigilance
2004-07-01;2004;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9818300604820251;moving to the monetary analysis the overall picture remains unchanged from our previous assessment
2004-07-01;2004;July;REPORT;Negative;0.8399012684822083;annual m3 growth rates have fallen over recent months
2004-07-01;2004;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9911004900932312;while this decline partly reflects base effects the portfolio decisions of firms and households are also returning to normal as financial uncertainties have receded
2004-07-01;2004;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9688313603401184;indeed there are signs that savings are increasingly being allocated to longterm assets outside m3 rather than to liquid monetary assets
2004-07-01;2004;July;REPORT;Positive;0.550342321395874;however despite the recent moderation of annual m3 growth there remains substantially more liquidity in the euro area than is needed to finance noninflationary growth
2004-07-01;2004;July;REPORT;Positive;0.7047021389007568;while a significant part of the excess liquidity has accumulated as a result of past portfolio shifts low interest rates have also fuelled the buildup of liquid assets
2004-07-01;2004;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9421057105064392;the low level of interest rates also supports credit growth
2004-07-01;2004;July;REPORT;Negative;0.7852933406829834;the stock of excess liquidity if it persists may pose an upside risk to price stability over the medium term
2004-07-01;2004;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9835464954376221;to sum up the economic analysis indicates that the mediumterm outlook for price developments remains in line with price stability while ongoing close monitoring is necessary
2004-07-01;2004;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.575721025466919;crosschecking with the monetary analysis supports this conclusion including the case for continued vigilance with regard to the materialisation of upside risks to price stability
2004-07-01;2004;July;REPORT;Negative;0.6174702048301697;the governing council also discussed a number of issues relating to economic policies in the euro area
2004-07-01;2004;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.7613049745559692;first as regards fiscal policies it is now of the highest priority that all countries concerned reestablish their commitment to consolidation in order to avoid past mistakes of unbalanced policies in a recovery period
2004-07-01;2004;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9258571267127991;indeed the recovery offers the opportunity to put public finances on a sounder track
2004-07-01;2004;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9773516058921814;this requires a strict control of expenditure in the implementation of this years budget and a comprehensive reform strategy as a basis for next years fiscal planning
2004-07-01;2004;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9916343688964844;credible expenditurebased reforms are needed to sustain budgetary consolidation and promote the soundness of social security systems thereby strengthening confidence in the short term and economic growth prospects in the medium term
2004-07-01;2004;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.6299246549606323;maintaining the existing institutional framework and implementing it consistently is essential to safeguard the soundness of public finances and the macroeconomic environment
2004-07-01;2004;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9418665170669556;in the view of the governing council the stability and growth pact should not be changed even though its implementation within the current framework could be improved further
2004-07-01;2004;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9301918745040894;a second issue we have discussed in depth over recent weeks has been the need to clearly step up the pace of structural reforms in the labour and product markets
2004-07-01;2004;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9951056241989136;in this connection the governing council expressed concern about growth in euro area labour productivity having been on a downward trend since the mid1990s
2004-07-01;2004;July;REPORT;Negative;0.5515974164009094;while this partly reflects improvements in employment it is also the consequence of suboptimal progress in fostering overall economic efficiency
2004-07-01;2004;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.7997516393661499;reaping the benefits of the technological advances and efficiency gains associated with producing and using new information and communication technologies requires in particular the removal of structural rigidities
2004-07-01;2004;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9401131272315979;in this respect stimulating further product market competition particularly in the services sectors and facilitating industrial restructuring could speed up innovation and the adoption of the new technologies
2004-07-01;2004;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9559061527252197;at the same time strengthening and spreading technological advances across the individual sectors of the euro area economy must go hand in hand with increased efforts to enhance human capital and adjust educational systems to the changing needs of the labour market
2004-07-01;2004;July;REPORT;Positive;0.990054726600647;since the mid1990s somewhat stronger average employment growth has partly compensated for the negative impact of lower productivity gains on overall output growth
2004-07-01;2004;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9931411147117615;however despite past improvements in employment the labour supply and its utilisation in the euro area remain low on international comparison
2004-07-01;2004;July;REPORT;Negative;0.7752701640129089;a relatively smaller proportion of the workingage population participates in the labour market a higher proportion of those participating is unemployed and those who are employed work on average far fewer hours per year than elsewhere
2004-07-01;2004;July;REPORT;Negative;0.5602571368217468;hence there is a need for further policy changes in the euro area that underpin the labour supply and its utilisation and thereby raise the mediumterm growth prospects so as to preserve average living standards in the face of an ageing population
