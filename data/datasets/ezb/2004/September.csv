2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9429973363876343;introductory statement to the press conference jeanclaude trichet president of the ecblucas papademos vice president of the ecb2 september 2004 with the transcript of the questions and answers ladies and gentlemen the vicepresident and i will now report on the outcome of todays meeting of the governing council of the ecb which was also attended by the president of the ecofin council mr zalm and commissioner almunia
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Positive;0.9907315373420715;we noted that the information which has become available in recent months indicates that the economic recovery in the euro area has maintained its momentum and should remain firm in the coming quarters
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Positive;0.4804975092411041;we have also witnessed somewhat higher inflation rates mainly due to developments in oil prices
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8566877841949463;at present our judgement is that although some upside risks to price stability exist the overall prospects remain in line with price stability over the medium term
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9903542995452881;accordingly we have retained our monetary policy stance and left the key ecb interest rates unchanged
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Negative;0.986842691898346;the level of interest rates is very low by historical standards both in nominal and in real terms lending support to economic activity
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Negative;0.6350464224815369;we will remain vigilant with regard to all developments which could imply risks to price stability over the medium term
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9345163106918335;i shall now explain our assessment in more detail turning first to the economic analysis
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Positive;0.9890329837799072;the latest data releases confirm that the economic recovery in the euro area is continuing
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Positive;0.514763355255127;according to eurostats flash estimate real gdp grew by 05 quarter on quarter in the second quarter of this year having recorded a 06 increase in the first quarter
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.5136522054672241;these growth rates are the strongest in the euro area for some time
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Positive;0.9729613661766052;the latest indicators of output and demand remain consistent with ongoing growth in real activity increasingly supported by domestic demand also in the third quarter of 2004 looking ahead the conditions for a continuation of the recovery remain in place
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Positive;0.9914173483848572;economic growth outside the euro area continues to be robust overall even if subject to temporary fluctuations and should continue to support euro area export growth
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Positive;0.9925629496574402;on the domestic side investment should benefit from the positive global environment and the very favourable financing conditions
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Positive;0.990313708782196;improvements in corporate efficiency and higher profits are also supporting business investment
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Positive;0.9882657527923584;moreover private consumption should continue its gradual recovery broadly in line with growth in real disposable income which with the usual lag should be further underpinned by an increase in employment growth later on
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Positive;0.9803609848022461;against this background we expect the economic recovery in the euro area to continue and to become more broadly based over the coming quarters leading to a somewhat stronger upswing in the course of 2005 this is also reflected in the ecb staff projections which will be published today
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8060160279273987;they envisage euro area real gdp growth of between 16 and 22 on average in 2004 rising to between 18 and 28 in 2005 these growth rates are close to estimates for longrun potential growth and for both years they are slightly higher than was expected in the june eurosystem staff projections
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9841794371604919;available forecasts from international organisations and other sources convey a broadly similar picture
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9622906446456909;overall the risks to these projections seem to be broadly balanced
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Positive;0.9918439984321594;on the upside the ongoing momentum of the recovery may again imply more positive developments for economic growth in the coming quarters
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9939331412315369;on the downside there are still concerns about continuing economic imbalances in other parts of the world
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9001332521438599;these imbalances could affect the sustainability of the economic recovery
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9896278381347656;another downside risk to the growth projections relates to oil prices
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9883235692977905;if these were to remain higher than currently expected by markets this could dampen both foreign and domestic demand
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9712501764297485;in assessing these risks however it should be taken into account that when expressed in euro the recent rise in oil prices has been significantly smaller than in previous episodes when oil price increases had a major impact on the world economy
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9944705963134766;in addition in real terms oil prices are significantly below the peaks they have reached in the past
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9929208159446716;moreover when compared with the 1970s and 1980s the oil intensity of production in the euro area and elsewhere has fallen significantly
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Positive;0.99055415391922;finally it should be kept in mind that in contrast to previous periods of oil price turmoil this years rise in oil prices is not only due to supplyside factors but is also driven by the strong global expansion
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9826760292053223;all these factors put the downside risks to economic activity coming from oil prices into perspective
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9550076723098755;however recent oil price developments have had a visible direct impact on price developments in the euro area
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Negative;0.8929772973060608;eurostats flash estimate for annual hicp inflation in august was 23 unchanged from july on the basis of current market expectations for oil prices it appears unlikely that annual inflation rates will return to levels below 2 in the remainder of this year
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Positive;0.6605801582336426;looking ahead however there are no indications at present of stronger underlying inflationary pressures building up domestically
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9861899018287659;recent wage developments have been moderate and this trend is expected to continue for some time to come in view of the continued high level of unemployment in the euro area
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9917519688606262;if this is the case and provided that oneoff shocks to prices from other sources such as those seen in 2004 are not repeated annual inflation rates should drop below 2 in 2005 against this background the ecb staff projections put average annual hicp inflation at between 21 and 23 for 2004 and between 13 and 23 for 2005 the lower end of these ranges is slightly higher than what was projected in june for both 2004 and 2005 the ecb staff projections for inflation are broadly consistent with other recently released forecasts
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9485613703727722;however several upward risks to the projections for inflation exist
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Negative;0.5480838418006897;concerns relate in particular to oil price developments which may continue to have a visible impact on inflation
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9835523962974548;oil price rises also imply the risk of secondround effects emerging in wage and pricesetting a risk which intensifies when the economic upswing strengthens
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Negative;0.8949654698371887;a further upward risk relates to the future evolution of indirect taxes and administered prices
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.664405882358551;indeed upside risks to inflation are also reflected in the continued elevated levels of measures of longterm inflation expectations derived from financial market indicators
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8034980297088623;while these indicators should always be interpreted with caution their current level calls for particular vigilance
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Positive;0.9763613939285278;turning to the monetary analysis the annual rate of m3 growth has moderated significantly since the summer of 2003 this moderation largely represents a normalisation of portfolio allocation behaviour following the easing of the exceptional economic and financial uncertainty which prevailed between 2001 and early 2003 nonetheless m3 growth remains resilient
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.5515923500061035;it appears that the reversal of past portfolio shifts is proceeding more slowly than would have been expected on the basis of historical regularities
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Positive;0.8897784352302551;this may reflect an increased risk aversion of households and firms given the stock market losses they experienced between 2000 and the spring of 2003 in addition the low level of interest rates continues to support monetary expansion especially of the most liquid assets included in the narrow aggregate m1
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Positive;0.9885615706443787;the low level of interest rates also seems to be fuelling the growth of loans to the private sector which has risen to a relatively robust rate over recent months
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.847454845905304;in this respect the growth rate of mortgage loans to households is rather high and is associated with fairly dynamic housing market developments and real estate prices in several euro area countries
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Positive;0.6403646469116211;there remains substantially more liquidity in the euro area than is needed to finance noninflationary growth
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8875350952148438;at present it is not clear how this excess liquidity will be used in the future
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9352121353149414;if significant parts of these liquid holdings were to be transformed into transaction balances particularly at a time when confidence and economic activity were strengthening inflationary risks would rise
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Positive;0.990126371383667;in addition high excess liquidity and strong credit growth could become a source for strong asset price increases
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.95918869972229;to sum up while the economic analysis indicates that prospects are consistent with price stability being maintained over the medium term a number of upside risks need to be carefully monitored
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Positive;0.9333322048187256;crosschecking with the monetary analysis also supports the case for strong vigilance with regard to the materialisation of risks to price stability
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Negative;0.6436011791229248;as regards fiscal policy first data for 2004 indicate that most euro area countries are likely to miss the original budgetary targets set in their updated stability programmes
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Negative;0.8855698108673096;in some cases countries seem to have based their programmes on overly optimistic assumptions for economic developments
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Negative;0.795604944229126;in addition some countries have been implementing fewer consolidation measures than originally planned
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9565682411193848;as a consequence the aggregate fiscal balance for the euro area is not likely to improve in 2004 progress in fiscal consolidation needs to be prioritised and should be part of a comprehensive and growthfriendly reform agenda
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8532597422599792;the governing council remains convinced that there was and there is no need for changes to the text of the treaty and of the stability and growth pact
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9898077845573425;the pact is an appropriate framework for dealing with countries fiscal developments on a level playingfield
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9855056405067444;at the same time we consider that improvements could be introduced in the implementation of the pact
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9804510474205017;in line with the broad economic policy guidelines macroeconomic policies need to be oriented towards growth and stability in the euro area
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8955843448638916;this also requires sustained efforts to increase the flexibility of labour and product markets in the euro area
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8526619076728821;in this respect several governments in the euro area have taken courageous steps over recent months
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Positive;0.982658863067627;it is important that the reform momentum is maintained taking advantage of the economic recovery
2004-09-02;2004;September;REPORT;Positive;0.9865017533302307;this will not only increase overall economic efficiency and enhance longerterm growth prospects in the euro area but will also strengthen the basis for a sustained economic upswing in the euro area
