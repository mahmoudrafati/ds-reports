2004-06-03;2004;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9834893941879272;as you are aware twice a year eurosystem staff that is staff of the ecb and the euro area national central banks jointly produce a set of macroeconomic projections
2004-06-03;2004;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9882679581642151;these serve as one of the inputs into the deliberations of the governing council
2004-06-03;2004;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9873932600021362;subsequently the projections are published in the june and december issues of the monthly bulletin
2004-06-03;2004;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9847783446311951;as you also know in the interim period that is for march and september ecb staff produce what is basically an update of the eurosystem staff projections
2004-06-03;2004;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9854985475540161;these projections also serve as input into the meetings of the governing council but so far have not been published
2004-06-03;2004;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9708924889564514;the positive experience and familiarity gained over the past few years with the publication of macroeconomic projections have given us the confidence to go a step further by also publishing the interim ecb staff projections
2004-06-03;2004;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9900946021080017;therefore in the spirit of transparency and accountability the ecb staff projections will also be published from september 2004 onwards

2004-06-03;2004;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9327086210250854;this advance copy will be made available shortly after the end of this press conference both in hard copy and on the ecbs website
2004-06-03;2004;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.987628698348999;the same procedure will be applied in september and every three months thereafter
2004-06-03;2004;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9796054363250732;the fact that we have decided to publish the interim ecb staff projections in future does not change their role as one of the inputs into our deliberations
2004-06-03;2004;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9899911880493164;the governing council continues to base its monetary policy decisions on a comprehensive economic analysis which is crosschecked with the monetary analysis
2004-06-03;2004;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9471414089202881;let me now turn to todays monetary policy discussion
2004-06-03;2004;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9921547770500183;in summary we noted that the economic recovery has strengthened over recent months
2004-06-03;2004;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9888462424278259;at the same time we have also witnessed stronger inflationary pressures over the short term
2004-06-03;2004;June;REPORT;Negative;0.7813926339149475;nevertheless we are still of the view that the mediumterm outlook remains in line with price stability
2004-06-03;2004;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9855727553367615;accordingly we left the key ecb interest rates unchanged
2004-06-03;2004;June;REPORT;Positive;0.8399237990379333;the low level of interest rates continues to support the economic recovery
2004-06-03;2004;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.8557834029197693;we will remain vigilant with regard to all developments which could affect the risks to price stability over the medium term
2004-06-03;2004;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9488022327423096;i shall now explain our assessment in more detail
2004-06-03;2004;June;REPORT;Positive;0.8984447717666626;in the context of our economic analysis the latest data releases confirm that the economic recovery in the euro area is under way
2004-06-03;2004;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9764096736907959;according to eurostat real gdp grew by 06 quarter on quarter in the first quarter of this year and quarterly real gdp growth for the fourth quarter of last year was revised upwards from 03 to 04
2004-06-03;2004;June;REPORT;Positive;0.993019163608551;the more pronounced pace of real gdp growth mainly reflected both stronger private consumption and buoyant exports
2004-06-03;2004;June;REPORT;Positive;0.917285680770874;latest survey data still provide mixed signals with regard to the underlying strength of the recovery but remain fully consistent with ongoing growth in the current quarter
2004-06-03;2004;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.3733370304107666;looking ahead the conditions for a continuation of the recovery remain in place
2004-06-03;2004;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9919666647911072;economic growth outside the euro area continues to be strong and should promote export growth
2004-06-03;2004;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9924848675727844;on the domestic side investment should benefit from the positive global environment as well as from the favourable financing conditions
2004-06-03;2004;June;REPORT;Positive;0.990313708782196;improvements in corporate efficiency and higher profits are also supporting business investment
2004-06-03;2004;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9891862273216248;moreover private consumption should gradually recover from the stagnation witnessed during most of 2003 broadly in line with growth in real disposable income which with the usual lag should be further underpinned by an increase in employment growth later on
2004-06-03;2004;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9925287961959839;accordingly we expect an ongoing recovery in euro area economic growth over the coming quarters leading to a broader and stronger upswing in the course of next year
2004-06-03;2004;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9717487096786499;this is also reflected in the eurosystem staff projections which envisage euro area real gdp growth of between 14 and 20 on average in 2004 rising to between 17 and 27 in 2005 available forecasts from international and private organisations convey a broadly similar picture
2004-06-03;2004;June;REPORT;Negative;0.8724255561828613;with regard to this scenario there are risks and uncertainties in both directions
2004-06-03;2004;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9916896820068359;on the one hand the current rather robust pace of economic growth outside the euro area the recent development in private consumption as well as some survey data imply a potential for stronger growth dynamics particularly in the short term
2004-06-03;2004;June;REPORT;Negative;0.985501229763031;on the other hand high oil prices could pose a downside risk
2004-06-03;2004;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9925641417503357;over a longer horizon concerns also remain about the persistence of global imbalances
2004-06-03;2004;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9858381152153015;concerning prices recent oil price developments have created considerable upward pressure on consumer prices
2004-06-03;2004;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9919052124023438;according to eurostats flash estimate annual hicp inflation was 25 in may partly due to base effects after standing at 20 in april
2004-06-03;2004;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9833215475082397;markets expect oil prices to decline gradually from recent peaks
2004-06-03;2004;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9155458211898804;if they were to remain at their recent high levels it is to be expected that inflation rates would continue to be higher than previously anticipated and stay above 2 for longer than just a few months ahead
2004-06-03;2004;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9730762243270874;when assessing price trends over the medium term however the outlook remains favourable
2004-06-03;2004;June;REPORT;Negative;0.8482696413993835;in particular overall import price developments should remain moderate and inflationary pressure from wages and unit labour costs should be contained
2004-06-03;2004;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9893291592597961;both factors should help to bring annual rates of consumer price inflation back to below 2 in 2005 these views are in line with the eurosystem staff projections which put average annual hicp inflation at between 19 and 23 in 2004 and between 11 and 23 in 2005 they are also broadly consistent with recently released forecasts by international and private organisations
2004-06-03;2004;June;REPORT;Negative;0.46654343605041504;these forecasts and projections are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties
2004-06-03;2004;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.5441807508468628;concerns relate in particular to oil price developments
2004-06-03;2004;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9759677648544312;moreover there is insufficient knowledge today about future changes in indirect taxes and administered prices information on these items typically becomes available only towards the end of the year
2004-06-03;2004;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.973919689655304;against this background the potential risk for secondround effects via wages needs to be monitored closely
2004-06-03;2004;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9655967354774475;finally there has been an increase in measures of longterm inflation expectations derived from financial market indicators
2004-06-03;2004;June;REPORT;Negative;0.5323477387428284;while these indicators should be interpreted with caution the recent upward trend calls for particular vigilance
2004-06-03;2004;June;REPORT;Positive;0.6147803068161011;moving on to the monetary analysis we have seen increasing evidence of a normalisation of the portfolio behaviour of private investors
2004-06-03;2004;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9950670003890991;as a consequence annual m3 growth has fallen quite significantly over recent quarters
2004-06-03;2004;June;REPORT;Positive;0.8663265705108643;still the low level of interest rates continues to fuel monetary growth and the amount of excess liquidity remains high in the euro area
2004-06-03;2004;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9914034008979797;in an economic upswing the persistence of excess liquidity could lead to inflationary pressures over the medium term
2004-06-03;2004;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.939650297164917;to sum up the economic analysis indicates that the main scenario for the outlook for price developments over the medium term remains in line with price stability
2004-06-03;2004;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.818661093711853;however shortterm pressures on inflation have increased recently and some upside risks need to be taken into account
2004-06-03;2004;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9463142156600952;crosschecking with the monetary analysis also supports the case for vigilance with regard to the materialisation of risks to price stability
2004-06-03;2004;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9908218383789062;given the signs that the economic recovery will continue it is particularly important that fiscal policies and structural reforms play their part in improving the economic fundamentals of the euro area
2004-06-03;2004;June;REPORT;Negative;0.6438969373703003;it is regretful that recent fiscal developments have not been helpful in this respect
2004-06-03;2004;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9932697415351868;a growing number of countries are reporting significant imbalances and fiscal consolidation efforts fall disappointingly short of commitments
2004-06-03;2004;June;REPORT;Positive;0.8589058518409729;in order to strengthen confidence in a sustainable upswing it is now essential that clarity about the future course of consolidation of fiscal policies is reestablished in all countries concerned
2004-06-03;2004;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9627031087875366;this requires credible measures with an emphasis on structural expenditure reform so that imbalances are redressed taxbenefit systems become more growthfriendly and social security systems are put on a sound financial footing
2004-06-03;2004;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9880073070526123;these measures together with a revived momentum towards effectively implementing structural reforms in labour and product markets would provide very valuable support to the current economic upswing
