2004-11-04;2004;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9101117253303528;this is a worrisome development but there is no strong indication as yet that mediumterm inflationary pressures are building up in the euro area
2004-11-04;2004;November;REPORT;Negative;0.995403528213501;in particular wage growth appears to remain limited in the context of ongoing moderate real gdp growth and weak labour markets
2004-11-04;2004;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8528397679328918;against this background we have decided to leave the key ecb interest rates unchanged at their present levels which are very low by historical standards
2004-11-04;2004;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9329506158828735;however there are upside risks to price stability over the medium term
2004-11-04;2004;November;REPORT;Negative;0.35549014806747437;strong vigilance is therefore warranted with regard to all developments which could increase such risks
2004-11-04;2004;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9345163106918335;i shall now explain our assessment in more detail turning first to the economic analysis
2004-11-04;2004;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9855446219444275;the economic recovery started in the second half of 2003 and we saw positive developments in the first half of 2004 although shortterm indicators have become more mixed the basic determinants of economic activity remain consistent with continuing economic growth in 2005 on the external side we see some moderation taking place following a period in which the world economy has experienced its strongest dynamism in many years
2004-11-04;2004;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9912426471710205;nevertheless euro area exports should continue to benefit from positive global demand conditions in 2005 on the domestic side investment should be supported by the global environment the very favourable financing conditions in the euro area improved earnings and greater corporate efficiency gained through business restructuring
2004-11-04;2004;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9901711344718933;furthermore scope exists in the euro area as a whole for private consumption to strengthen particularly once labour market prospects improve more visibly
2004-11-04;2004;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9908744096755981;however this outlook is surrounded by continuing uncertainty in particular stemming from recent developments in oil markets
2004-11-04;2004;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9454680681228638;on the one hand the magnitude and nature of this shock differ from earlier experiences when oil price rises were much stronger and mainly due to supply constraints
2004-11-04;2004;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9549303650856018;in addition the oil intensity of production is significantly lower in the euro area
2004-11-04;2004;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9929991960525513;on the other hand recent oil price increases constitute a nonetheless sizeable adverse shock to the euro area economy
2004-11-04;2004;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9920873045921326;if oil prices were to remain at current levels or even increase further they would dampen the strength of the recovery both inside and outside the euro area
2004-11-04;2004;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9253146052360535;under certain conditions a smoother absorption of the oil price shock can be ensured in particular secondround effects in wage and pricesetting must continue to be avoided and fiscal authorities should refrain from taking measures which would prolong the necessary adjustment process
2004-11-04;2004;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9891071915626526;with regard to consumer prices annual inflation increased to 25 in october according to eurostats flash estimate
2004-11-04;2004;November;REPORT;Positive;0.677196204662323;this was a strong increase after the decline to 21 in september from 23 in august and shows that oil price developments have had a sizeable direct impact on the euro area hicp in recent weeks
2004-11-04;2004;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9352053999900818;moreover the oil price shock may feed through the economy and generate further indirect effects as indicated by developments in producer prices
2004-11-04;2004;November;REPORT;Negative;0.43894273042678833;looking further ahead however the information available so far does not suggest that stronger underlying inflationary pressures are building up in the euro area
2004-11-04;2004;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9939051270484924;wage increases have remained limited since the last quarter of 2003 and this trend is expected to persist in the context of ongoing moderate growth and weak labour markets
2004-11-04;2004;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9788022041320801;nevertheless a number of upward risks to the outlook for price stability have emerged over recent months
2004-11-04;2004;November;REPORT;Negative;0.5536424517631531;risks are mainly associated with oil price developments possible renewed increases in indirect taxes and administrative prices and potential secondround effects stemming from wage and pricesetting behaviour
2004-11-04;2004;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9833595752716064;further indications for the mediumterm outlook are provided by the monetary analysis
2004-11-04;2004;November;REPORT;Negative;0.995242714881897;the downward trend in annual m3 growth in the first half of this year appears to have come to a halt in recent months
2004-11-04;2004;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9807010889053345;the shorterterm dynamics of m3 have strengthened and its annual growth rates are rising
2004-11-04;2004;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.969541072845459;these developments reflect the stimulative effect of the historically low level of interest rates in the euro area on monetary expansion
2004-11-04;2004;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9880869388580322;demand for the most liquid components of m3 contained in the narrow aggregate m1 is particularly strong
2004-11-04;2004;November;REPORT;Negative;0.7375035881996155;the low level of interest rates is also fuelling private sector demand for credit

2004-11-04;2004;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9560868740081787;this could pose inflationary risks in the future if the excess liquidity is not progressively reduced as a result of reverse portfolio shifts
2004-11-04;2004;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9612069725990295;moreover persistently high excess liquidity and strong credit growth could become a source of unsustainable asset price increases particularly in property markets
2004-11-04;2004;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9279701709747314;to sum up the economic analysis suggests that underlying inflationary pressures are still contained but a number of mediumterm upside risks to price stability need to be monitored closely
2004-11-04;2004;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9268835783004761;it is particularly important that these do not affect longterm inflation expectations
2004-11-04;2004;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9602656364440918;crosschecking with the monetary analysis continues to support the case for strong vigilance with regard to the materialisation of risks to price stability

2004-11-04;2004;November;REPORT;Positive;0.986738920211792;most countries have presented their budget plans for 2005 in some cases there are encouraging signs that member states are planning to correct excessive deficits or make progress towards closetobalance or insurplus budgetary positions
2004-11-04;2004;November;REPORT;Negative;0.6567070484161377;however there are other cases where there are significant risks that commitments under the stability and growth pact will not be met or where imbalances are on the rise and new breaches of the 3 reference value might occur
2004-11-04;2004;November;REPORT;Negative;0.5572035908699036;it is therefore imperative that 2005 budgets prioritise consolidation where this is necessary
2004-11-04;2004;November;REPORT;Positive;0.8771074414253235;moreover it is of vital importance that the reliable compilation and timely reporting of government finance statistics are ensured
