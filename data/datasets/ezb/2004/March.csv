2004-03-04;2004;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9296226501464844;this fall was mainly due to base effects stemming from energy prices as a sharp increase in oil prices which occurred in early 2003 dropped out of the calculation of the annual rate in february 2004 over the coming months volatility in annual inflation rates is likely to be observed mainly due to further base effects from energy prices as well as to increases in indirect taxes
