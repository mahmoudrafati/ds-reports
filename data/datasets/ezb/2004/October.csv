2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.6395145058631897;todays meeting is the tenth time that the governing council has met outside frankfurt and i would like to thank governor quaden for his invitation
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.5051446557044983;let me also express our gratitude to the staff of the nationale bank van belgiÃ«banque nationale de belgique for their kind hospitality and perfect organisation of todays meeting
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9709808230400085;let me now report on the outcome of todays meeting
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9772734045982361;as regards economic growth while some uncertainty has recently arisen concerning the expected strengthening of activity the economic recovery in the euro area is ongoing
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Positive;0.5330896973609924;looking at price developments high oil prices have had a visible direct impact on inflation rates this year
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Positive;0.619987964630127;however the risk of secondround effects still seems to be contained and the overall outlook remains consistent with price stability over the medium term
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9881485104560852;accordingly we have left the key ecb interest rates unchanged
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9772710204124451;this means that the level of interest rates continues to be very low by historical standards in both nominal and real terms
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Positive;0.8792697787284851;strong vigilance is warranted with regard to all developments which could imply risks to price stability over the medium term
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9345163106918335;i shall now explain our assessment in more detail turning first to the economic analysis
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.824644923210144;the information available to date indicates that the economic recovery in the euro area is continuing
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9890193343162537;in particular survey indicators up to september point to ongoing growth in industrial production and the services sector
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9916459918022156;moreover the gradual recovery in consumer confidence is proceeding and there are some tentative signs of an improvement in the prospects for employment although available indicators for household spending do not yet point to an immediate strengthening of consumption growth
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.7787039279937744;all in all the growth momentum seen in the euro area in the first half of 2004 should be broadly maintained in the coming quarters in line with available forecasts from international organisations
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9913438558578491;on the external side euro area exports should continue to benefit from favourable global demand conditions not least from trade with the new eu member states where import demand has been strengthening
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9924951791763306;on the domestic side investment should benefit from the positive global environment and the very favourable financing conditions in the euro area
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9885989427566528;as companies restructure improvements in corporate efficiency and higher profits are also supporting business investment
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9597959518432617;moreover there is scope for a recovery in euro area private consumption in line with growth in real disposable income
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9861010909080505;any central scenario for future developments is surrounded by a good deal of uncertainty which at present is particularly related to oil prices
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9926257729530334;if oil prices were to remain high or even increase further it could dampen the strength of the recovery both inside and outside the euro area even though the oil intensity of production has fallen significantly since the 1970s and 1980s
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.5884656310081482;all in all while the burden resulting from higher oil prices cannot be avoided its mediumterm impact should be of a more limited magnitude than in the past
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9567396640777588;obviously for this outcome to materialise all parties concerned must live up to their responsibilities
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9441589713096619;turning to consumer prices the oil market developments have had a direct impact on the euro area hicp
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9908692836761475;following an annual rate of inflation of 17 in the first quarter of 2004 inflation reached 23 in the second quarter and remained at that level in july and august
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Negative;0.5851168036460876;according to eurostats flash estimate annual hicp inflation seems to have fallen slightly in september to 22
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8311961889266968;higher energy prices may have been more than compensated by lower food prices partly due to base effects resulting from last years strong increases in this subcategory
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9780983924865723;still on the basis of current market expectations for oil prices it appears unlikely that annual inflation rates will return to levels below 2 in the remainder of this year
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Negative;0.4951121509075165;nevertheless looking further ahead the available information does not indicate that stronger underlying inflationary pressures are building up domestically
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Positive;0.7944814562797546;recent wage developments have remained moderate and this trend should continue
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9604430794715881;on the basis of this assumption and provided that there are no further significant shocks to prices annual inflation rates should drop below 2 in 2005 several upward risks to the outlook for price stability continue to exist
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.5542417764663696;concerns again relate to oil price developments in particular to the extent that secondround effects stemming from wage and pricesetting behaviour materialise
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8796030282974243;it is therefore of the utmost importance to avoid inappropriate reactions as observed in past episodes of strong oil price increases
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Negative;0.8540708422660828;a further upward risk relates to the future development of indirect taxes and administered prices
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.7528418302536011;these upside risks call for ongoing vigilance which is a necessary condition for keeping medium to longterm inflation expectations in line with our definition of price stability
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Positive;0.8860741853713989;as regards the monetary analysis m3 growth remains resilient
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Positive;0.5555111765861511;the downward trend in annual m3 growth from mid2003 appears to have halted over the summer months and the shorterterm dynamics of m3 have strengthened
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.6629135012626648;this reflects the fact that the historically low level of interest rates in the euro area continues to support monetary expansion especially of the most liquid assets included in the narrow aggregate m1
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Positive;0.8945392370223999;the low level of interest rates also fuels the growth of mfi credit
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9894108176231384;the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector remains robust largely driven by the dynamism of mortgage loans
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9903942942619324;these are also supported by strong house price increases in several euro area countries
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Positive;0.6403646469116211;there remains substantially more liquidity in the euro area than is needed to finance noninflationary growth
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9433002471923828;at present it is not clear how this excess liquidity which is mainly the result of past portfolio shifts will be used in the future
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9352121353149414;if significant parts of these liquid holdings were to be transformed into transaction balances particularly at a time when confidence and economic activity were strengthening inflationary risks would rise
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9883020520210266;in addition high excess liquidity and strong credit growth could become a source of substantial asset price increases
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9198145866394043;to sum up annual inflation rates should fall below 2 in 2005 but a number of mediumterm upside risks to price stability need to be carefully monitored
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9333322048187256;crosschecking with the monetary analysis also supports the case for strong vigilance with regard to the materialisation of risks to price stability
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.4958696961402893;let me also address the current evidence on fiscal developments where the latest budgetary notifications are a source of concern
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9300422072410583;while some countries will maintain a sound budgetary position a significant number of euro area countries are expected to record deficits near to or above 3
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9771843552589417;the aggregate euro area fiscal deficittogdp ratio is expected to increase somewhat as is the debttogdp ratio
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9714820981025696;in the coming years important challenges for the consolidation of public finances will have to be faced
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.49117511510849;member states need to renew their consolidation efforts and should not rely on oneoff measures so as to comply with their commitments under the stability and growth pact and to foster confidence
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.6067736148834229;they must also set the right priorities in public finances towards structural reform innovation and competitiveness
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9629331827163696;this would very much support the lisbon agenda and thereby promote economic growth foster job creation and reduce unemployment
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Positive;0.5124328136444092;concerning the european fiscal framework the governing council is convinced that substantial improvements in the implementation of the stability and growth pact are possible and would be beneficial while we would warn against a change to the text of the treaty or the regulations which form the basis of the pact
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.7242739200592041;we consider the pact as key to ensuring macroeconomic stability on a sustainable basis
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.959010660648346;it is a framework which is necessary to preserve sound fiscal policies in the euro area for which strict surveillance and effective peer pressure on national budget policies are indispensable
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9400079250335693;it is of vital importance to the credibility of the budgetary surveillance that the reliable compilation and timely reporting of government finance statistics is ensured
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9798830151557922;the european accounting rules must be fully respected when recording all types of expenditure and revenue
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9804630875587463;this should be done in a manner that is consistent and stable over time and homogeneous across countries
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9650236368179321;the procedures must not be vulnerable to political and electoral cycles as stated by the ecofin council
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9740737080574036;countries should consider the quality and integrity of their statistics as a priority matter
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9066407084465027;finally let me report on the detailed discussion we had today on employment and unemployment developments in the euro area
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9900480508804321;two observations stand out when we look at the period of relatively slow real gdp expansion since early 2001 first after an initial rise the euro area unemployment rate has remained broadly unchanged since early 2003 and second there seems to have been a relatively limited negative impact on employment growth over the past few years
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9376034736633301;the following factors might help to explain this pattern
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9863866567611694;while the period of slow growth has been relatively long from a historical perspective the cyclical amplitudes have been smaller and have not therefore triggered very sharp reactions of employment and unemployment
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.7817510962486267;in addition wage developments have been more favourable than in previous episodes and firms may have  to a greater extent than previously  adjusted labour input downwards in term of hours rather than in terms of employees
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.6980942487716675;this in turn might indicate that firms have gained an element of flexibility to adjust costs
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9834941625595093;looking forward from a cyclical point of view employment should recover and unemployment could start falling in the course of next year if overall demand develops as expected
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9923783540725708;this should support economic growth through an increase in labour income and a positive impact on consumer confidence and thus on consumption
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9847664833068848;however structural problems remain large
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.7498214244842529;this is highlighted for example by the fact that over 40 of all unemployed people in the euro area have been without a job for more than a year
2004-10-07;2004;October;REPORT;Negative;0.8012219667434692;in order to decisively overcome the obstacles towards more employment growth and to reduce the trend or structural level of unemployment further comprehensive labour market reforms are of the essence
