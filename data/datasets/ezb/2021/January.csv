2021-01-14;2021;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9113730788230896;given that the return to the governing councils inflation aim was delayed by the pandemic it was widely considered an appropriate and proportional response to the prevailing type of shock to increase the horizon of net purchases under the pepp until march 2022 extend the reinvestments of the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the pepp until the end of 2023 and to add more tltro iii operations extending the pandemicrelated low interest rate period to june 2022 overall it was agreed that the proposed longer horizon of the pepp and tltro iii was broadly in line with the expected duration of the pandemic crisis the continued uncertainty about the rollout of the vaccines and the expected return of economic activity to its prepandemic level
2021-01-14;2021;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9643703103065491;it was also agreed that the assessment by mr lane that on balance the benefits of pepp purchases and the tltro iii outweighed the potential costs continued to hold
2021-01-14;2021;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.6905195116996765;the pepp was seen as the cornerstone of the governing councils monetary policy package as thanks to its flexibility it had proven particularly effective in ensuring the eurosystem maintained a stabilising presence in the markets providing a backstop against a disorderly repricing of risk
2021-01-14;2021;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9665773510932922;the pepp also contributed to easing the monetary policy stance in response to the downward impact of the pandemic on the path of inflation
2021-01-14;2021;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9754928350448608;an expansion of the pepp envelope by 500 billion in addition to the 20 billion of monthly purchases under the app was generally seen as appropriate to underpin the governing councils commitment to maintaining favourable financing conditions over the extended pandemic period
2021-01-14;2021;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.865400493144989;a more moderate increase in the pepp envelope was advocated by a number of members based on the argument that significant space for purchases was still available from past decisions and that in an environment of high uncertainty it was worth keeping some powder dry by maintaining the option to further adjust the envelope in the future
2021-01-14;2021;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.7837046980857849;however some arguments were also made in favour of a larger envelope
2021-01-14;2021;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.7196603417396545;while the already accommodative level of current financing conditions was acknowledged it was argued that the proposed increase in the pepp envelope was insufficient to ease financing conditions further and bring inflation closer to the governing councils aim also in the light of the fact that the additional envelope of 120 billion for the app would run out by the end of 2020 members highlighted the flexibility embodied in the pepp
2021-01-14;2021;January;REPORT;Negative;0.5882126092910767;it was argued that the focus on preserving favourable financing conditions implied a move away from a constant monthly pace of purchases towards adjusting the pace according to market conditions with a view to preventing a tightening of financing conditions inconsistent with countering the downward impact of the pandemic on the projected path of inflation
2021-01-14;2021;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9289987683296204;this approach combined with forceful communication could allow the governing council to reduce the pace of purchases while having an equivalent effect on financing conditions
2021-01-14;2021;January;REPORT;Positive;0.8184776902198792;this could result in greater efficiency and in using less than the entire envelope over the duration of the programme
2021-01-14;2021;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9876735806465149;the flexibility in the allocation of the pepp purchases over time was seen as being well aligned with the principle of proportionality and the governing councils monetary policy stance
2021-01-14;2021;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9895616173744202;at the same time it was seen as essential for the governing council to state that it stood ready to increase the envelope further if needed
2021-01-14;2021;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9913517236709595;attention was drawn to possible constraints on and side effects of additional purchases such as the risks of moral hazard fiscal dominance and distorted market functioning
2021-01-14;2021;January;REPORT;Positive;0.8043534159660339;safeguards to guarantee a sufficient distance from monetary financing concerns  such as the guidance for the allocation of the stock of asset purchases according to the capital key  were seen as important to maintain legitimacy and independence
2021-01-14;2021;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9493436217308044;it was emphasised that in the present environment fiscal policy remained the most appropriate response to the pandemicdriven crisis and monetary policy should play a secondary role
2021-01-14;2021;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9925351142883301;members also exchanged views on how to assess favourable financing conditions and felt that financing conditions should be considered in a holistic way with their appropriate level also depending on the inflation outlook
2021-01-14;2021;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9651839733123779;it was deemed important to explain that maintaining favourable financing conditions allowed for some flexibility if the fundamentals changed or if conditions tightened endogenously in response to economic developments
2021-01-14;2021;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9897090792655945;in addition the relevant financing conditions were seen to pertain to all private and public sectors of the economy comprising interest rates as well as credit volumes and conditions
2021-01-14;2021;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9519372582435608;with regard to the recalibration of the tltro iii conditions the three proposed changes  the extension of the pandemicrelated low interest rate period the addition of more operations and the increase in the amount that could potentially be borrowed  were seen as appropriate ways to preserve attractive funding conditions and to help banks to secure the liquidity required to keep extending loans to households and firms on favourable lending terms
2021-01-14;2021;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9552039504051208;the new lending performance target was considered an important element giving banks an incentive to provide additional credit whereas the current attractive pricing of tltro iii seemed sufficient to provide ongoing backing for bankbased monetary policy transmission
2021-01-14;2021;January;REPORT;Positive;0.8980043530464172;the proposed increase in the amount that could potentially be borrowed under tltro iii was seen as supporting the flow of credit to the real economy allowing banks to secure liquidity on very favourable terms
2021-01-14;2021;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9849896430969238;it was recalled that this amount was defined in relation to euro area banks stock of eligible loans which amounted to just over half of their total loan book
2021-01-14;2021;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9896613359451294;a number of reservations were expressed with regard to the proposed increase in the borrowing allowance to 60 related in particular to concerns that it would make banks increasingly dependent on the eurosystem as their funding source and could induce banks to invest more in sovereign debt
2021-01-14;2021;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9871776103973389;against this background broad agreement was reached to raise the borrowing allowance to 55 of the stock of eligible loans
2021-01-14;2021;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9878589510917664;as regards communication members widely agreed with the elements proposed by mr lane in his introduction
2021-01-14;2021;January;REPORT;Positive;0.8907018899917603;although uncertainty continued to be pronounced it was deemed important to acknowledge the positive news that had emerged since the last meeting and its impact on the balance of risk
2021-01-14;2021;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9827849268913269;at the same time it was felt that the governing council needed to stress that the mediumterm inflation outlook was far from an inflation rate of below but close to 2
2021-01-14;2021;January;REPORT;Negative;0.8291801810264587;the view was expressed that the governing council could not afford to be perceived as complacent about the inflation path embodied in the projections

2021-01-14;2021;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9786586761474609;an important shift in implementing the pepp was to be highlighted and it should be underlined that if favourable financing conditions could be maintained with asset purchase flows that did not exhaust the full amount available under the pepp the envelope need not be used in full
2021-01-14;2021;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9126060009002686;at the same time the governing council should also indicate its willingness to recalibrate the pepp in the future as needed to ensure that overall financing conditions were sufficiently favourable to counteract the impact of the pandemic on the mediumterm inflation outlook
2021-01-14;2021;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.983260452747345;in this context it was noted that the important role that the reinvestment of principal payments played for the monetary policy stance had to be underlined as well
2021-01-14;2021;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.994201123714447;furthermore the governing council needed to announce that it would carefully monitor whether its measures were sufficient to guarantee a return of inflation to its aim and to reiterate that it stood ready to adjust all of its instruments as appropriate to ensure that inflation moved towards its aim in a sustained manner in line with its commitment to symmetry
