2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9403382539749146;29 july 2021 meeting of 7 july 2021 account of the monetary policy meeting of the governing council of the european central bank held in frankfurt am main on wednesday 7 july 2021 conclusion of the ecbs strategy review 202021 the president started her introduction by looking back at the strategy review that the governing council had been conducting over the previous 18 months drawing on an immense collective effort by staff at the ecb and the national central banks ncbs of the euro area
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9107180237770081;while taking the ecbs primary mandate of price stability as a given the review had allowed the governing council to challenge its thinking engage with numerous stakeholders reflect discuss and reach common ground on how to adapt its strategy
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9766245484352112;the new strategy which would be reflected in the document entitled the ecbs monetary policy strategy statement intended for publication on the ecbs website was a strong foundation that would help guide the governing council in the conduct of its monetary policy in the years to come
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9756383895874023;the president then reviewed the key elements of the new strategy in more detail
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9917663931846619;the governing council judged that the harmonised index of consumer prices hicp remained the appropriate price measure for assessing the achievement of its price stability objective
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9849867224693298;at the same time european citizens had called for a broader coverage of housing costs in the hicp
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.988436222076416;the governing council had therefore recommended a roadmap for the inclusion of owneroccupied housing in the hicp although it recognised that this was a multiyear project to be led by eurostat
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.990465521812439;in the transition period the main reference index for monetary policy remained the current hicp but initial estimates of owneroccupied housing costs would play a supplementary role alongside the set of broader inflation measures and would help the governing council to assess the contribution of housing costs to inflation
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9852956533432007;to improve clarity about the price stability objective and with the aim of better anchoring inflation expectations the governing council had decided to amend its formulation
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9895623326301575;the governing council considered that price stability was best maintained by aiming for a two per cent inflation target over the medium term
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9843111634254456;a two per cent inflation target was consistent with standard definitions of price stability and provided a safety margin to protect the effectiveness of monetary policy in responding to disinflationary shocks and to guard against the risk of deflation
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9865608811378479;the formulation in terms of a specific quantitative target was clear and easy to communicate and thereby provided a strong anchor for inflation expectations which was essential for maintaining price stability
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9911023378372192;it would replace the doublekey formulation which featured a definition of price stability in terms of a range of positive inflation rates below two per cent and within that range an inflation aim of below but close to two per cent
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9058820009231567;the previous formulation was widely seen as too complicated and occasionally giving rise to misperceptions about the ecbs aspirations
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9894585609436035;the new formulation removed possible ambiguities and resolutely conveyed that two per cent was not a ceiling
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9921244978904724;the governing councils commitment to the two per cent target was symmetric
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9937792420387268;symmetry meant that the governing council considered negative and positive deviations of inflation from the target to be equally undesirable
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9859157800674438;to maintain the symmetry of its inflation target the governing council recognised the importance of taking into account the implications of the effective lower bound on nominal interest rates
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Negative;0.970559298992157;in particular when these rates tended to be low throughout the business cycle like at present the economy operated not too far from the lower bound
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.5507182478904724;episodes in which the policy rate was constrained at the lower bound were often associated with disinflationary pressure
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.7853679060935974;addressing this required especially forceful or persistent monetary policy measures to avoid negative deviations from the inflation target becoming entrenched
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9823251962661743;in these conditions in the face of large adverse shocks the governing councils policy response would appropriately grounded in a careful proportionality analysis include especially forceful monetary policy measures
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9707560539245605;in addition closer to the effective lower bound it might also call for a more persistent use of the ecbs monetary policy instruments
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9785891175270081;this might also imply a transitory period in which inflation was moderately above target
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9636492133140564;the ecbs new strategy would confirm the mediumterm orientation of its monetary policy which since the ecbs inception had been an important principle of the strategy
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9842389822006226;the governing council recognised that monetary policy could not and should not attempt to finetune shortterm developments in inflation
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9441143274307251;monetary policy affected the economy with variable time lags
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9917627573013306;the mediumterm orientation allowed the governing council to be forwardlooking and respond flexibly to fluctuations in output and inflation
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8480968475341797;flexibility was important since the appropriate policy response depended on the circumstances as well as on the source magnitude and persistence of the shocks affecting the economy
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9923155307769775;the mediumterm orientation also allowed the governing council to cater for other considerations relevant to the pursuit of price stability
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9731978178024292;employment financial stability risks and climate change were some of the areas that had been assessed in great depth during the strategy review
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9892863631248474;the governing council had also carefully reviewed the appropriateness of the instruments in its monetary policy toolkit
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9933115243911743;it was clear that the key ecb interest rates  the rate on the main refinancing operations the deposit facility rate and the marginal lending rate  would remain its primary instruments
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8676312565803528;but in a low interest rate environment in which the policy rates were more likely to encounter and remain constrained at the lower bound the governing council would continue to employ other instruments when needed
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9904154539108276;forward guidance asset purchases and longerterm refinancing operations over the past decade had helped mitigate the limitations generated by the lower bound and would remain an integral part of the governing councils toolkit to be used as appropriate
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9723302125930786;the governing council had also reflected on the ecbs analytical framework and had introduced important changes
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.983071506023407;the framework provided the foundation for the governing councils monetary policy decisions including the regular proportionality assessment of the effectiveness efficiency and side effects of its measures
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9870988726615906;historically the ecb had been known for its two pillars which identified risks to price stability from two distinct perspectives the economic analysis and the monetary analysis
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9913356304168701;these two sources of risks to price stability were crosschecked against each other to form an overall assessment
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9249087572097778;the new strategy acknowledged the advantages of having two specialised areas of analyses on the economy but also recognised the value of integrating the analysis in a world in which there were multiple feedback channels from the monetary and financial spheres to the broader economy and vice versa
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9755217432975769;the new integrated assessment built on the evolution that the economic and monetary analyses had undergone over time
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9727823734283447;the monetary analysis had increasingly focused on assessing the transmission of monetary policy measures as well as the risks to price stability from financial imbalances
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Negative;0.7798784971237183;meanwhile  owing to a weakening of the link between monetary aggregates and inflation  the original focus of the monetary analysis had become less important
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9299122095108032;at the same time the global financial crisis had brought to the fore the relevance of macrofinancial linkages that further emphasised the need for integrated analyses
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Negative;0.8353503346443176;climate change was an existential challenge for the world and it was of strategic importance for the ecbs mandate
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9925869107246399;the governing council would therefore account explicitly for the implications of climate change and the carbon transition in its new strategy
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9502284526824951;moreover the governing council would commit to an ambitious action plan as outlined in the dedicated press release
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9588630795478821;the action plan covered several key areas
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Positive;0.5644679665565491;first the ecb would further expand its analytical capacity in macroeconomic modelling and develop statistical indicators and new tools to assess the implications of climate change for monetary policy transmission and price stability
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9811692833900452;second it would introduce environmental sustainability disclosure requirements for eligibility for collateral and asset purchases
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9855718612670898;third it would adapt its risk assessment framework its corporate sector asset purchases and the collateral framework for climaterelated risks
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9880202412605286;during its strategy review the governing council had also addressed the communication of the ecbs monetary policy
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9651557803153992;it had heard directly how its policies affected the lives of european citizens and their desire to better understand those policies
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9542149901390076;the 2003 review had taken place well before smartphones were around so there had been a strong case for enhancing the ecbs communication with the outside world
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9906455278396606;some changes to be adopted in the following weeks would relate to regular communication
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9878352284431458;for example a new more narrativebased and more concise monetary policy statement would replace the introductory statement at monetary policy press conferences
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9688048362731934;but also the monetary policy communication geared towards the wider public would be adapted through a more visualised and more accessible approach
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.977916419506073;reflecting the successful experience with the listening events the governing council would continue to interact on a regular basis with the public via eurosystem outreach events
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9808529019355774;the strategy review 202021 had taken place 18 years after the previous one
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.5889248847961426;looking ahead the rapidly changing world meant that the governing council could not wait for another 18 years before undertaking the next review
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9901981353759766;a regular review cycle with the governing council periodically reassessing the appropriateness of its monetary policy strategy would ensure that the strategy remained fit for purpose
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Positive;0.6510006785392761;it would also further enhance the ecbs transparency and accountability to european citizens
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9864804148674011;the next assessment was expected to be carried out in 2025 in their subsequent discussion members expressed their appreciation for the excellent preparation as well as the background documentation that staff had prepared
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.5586029291152954;the underlying wellbalanced and comprehensive work provided a sound basis for implementing the agreed outcome
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9644931554794312;gratitude was also expressed to the president for initiating the review and to mr lane for guiding and leading the work
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9536235928535461;the fruitful collaboration between the ecb and ncbs was highlighted and it was suggested that this could serve as a model for further projects or taskforces
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9680452942848206;it was stressed that the revised strategy should be seen as an evolution of the original strategy which had been in place since 1998 and was clarified in 2003 the original strategy had served the ecb well but needed updating to account for the profound structural changes that the euro area economy had undergone in the meantime
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9677416086196899;it was also to be highlighted that the expansion of the existing strategy had benefited from analysis conducted by ecb and ncb staff that had fed into the strategy review
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9039602279663086;at the same time a wealth of research over the past years had helped to synthesise the experiences under the previous strategy and to mould it into the new one which from now on would guide the governing councils decisions ensuring consistency in the conduct of the ecbs monetary policy
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9755555391311646;members unanimously supported the new formulation of the ecbs price stability objective
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9932208061218262;an inflation target of 2 was judged to be in line with international practice and to provide an appropriate balance between avoiding the welfare cost of inflation and maintaining enough room for manoeuvre for monetary policy in the face of adverse shocks
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.7672452926635742;the symmetric formulation of the target would confirm and add credibility to the governing councils commitment to symmetry as communicated in its previous monetary policy decisions
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8657936453819275;it was also acknowledged that the existence of an effective lower bound on nominal interest rates required an especially forceful or persistent reaction to large adverse shocks which might also imply that inflation could moderately exceed 2 for a transitory period
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9905115962028503;while the set of key ecb interest rates remained the governing councils primary instrument forward guidance asset purchases and longerterm refinancing operations would remain an integral part of the ecbs toolkit to be used as appropriate and grounded in careful proportionality assessments including analysis of the benefits and possible side effects of monetary policy measures
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9806483387947083;such proportionality assessments also took into account the uncertainty about the effectiveness and side effects of policy instruments as well as the risks of the unanchoring of longerterm inflation expectations from the two per cent target
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9842121005058289;regarding the measurement of inflation the hicp was considered the best available price measure due to its quality and timeliness
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9756028652191162;however taking into account the feedback from the eurosystems outreach activities it was felt that further efforts should be made to incorporate the cost of owneroccupied housing into the hicp
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9826474785804749;the net acquisition approach was seen as the preferred method to do so
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8493518233299255;members very much welcomed the european statistical systems related work and recommended a fourstage roadmap towards full inclusion in the hicp
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9752441048622131;it was stressed that during the transition period the main reference index for monetary policy would remain the current hicp
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9038141369819641;it was also noted that the consumption component  not the investment component  of owneroccupied housing was key as the governing council was not intending to target asset prices
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.7984257936477661;regarding the climaterelated action plan it was highlighted that climate change was impacting the ecbs primary mandate through various channels
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9781810641288757;although the main responsibility to address climate change lay with governments the ecb was obliged to contribute in this domain within its mandate
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9442065954208374;members agreed with the proposed action plan and committed to further incorporating climate change considerations into the ecbs monetary policy framework to expanding its analytical capacity in macroeconomic modelling statistics and monetary policy with regard to climate change to including climate change considerations in monetary policy operations in the areas of disclosure risk assessment collateral framework and corporate sector asset purchases and to implementing the action plan in line with progress on the eu policies and initiatives in the field of environmental sustainability disclosure and reporting
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.5263689160346985;as regards communication the engagement with the public and the publics interest in the ecbs policy were considered a great asset
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Positive;0.5594322085380554;the interest citizens expressed in monetary policy was seen as encouraging the governing council to continue its efforts to explain its monetary policy decisions in an accessible way to the wider public
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9892926216125488;while the 8 july press conference would announce the outcome of the review the implementation of the changes planned would become visible in the communication following the governing councils 2122 july monetary policy meeting
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9858021140098572;taking into account the foregoing upon a proposal by the president the governing council unanimously approved the ecbs monetary policy strategy statement the longer explanatory note entitled overview of the monetary policy strategy and the press release entitled ecb presents action plan to include climate change considerations in its monetary policy strategy
2021-07-29;2021;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9785014986991882;these would be published on the ecbs website ahead of the press conference to be given by the president and vicepresident on the following day
