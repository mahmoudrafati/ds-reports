2021-10-28;2021;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9478232264518738;the upswing in inflation largely reflects a combination of three factors

2021-10-28;2021;October;REPORT;Negative;0.980348527431488;we continue to foresee inflation in the medium term remaining below our two per cent target
2021-10-28;2021;October;REPORT;Positive;0.8163743615150452;our policy measures including our revised forward guidance on the key ecb interest rates are crucial to helping the economy shift to a sustained recovery and ultimately to bringing inflation over the medium term to our target
