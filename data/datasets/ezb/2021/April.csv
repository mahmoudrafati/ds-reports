2021-04-08;2021;April;REPORT;Negative;0.6213327050209045;moreover it was argued that higher real rates were not necessarily a cause for concern and should not trigger a policy intervention if they reflected higher growth prospects rather than higher real term premia
2021-04-08;2021;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.7188399434089661;in this context a remark was made that assessing developments in real interest rates was subject to uncertainty as regards the measurement of the relevant inflation expectations
2021-04-08;2021;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8308068513870239;in view of the governing councils commitment to maintaining favourable financing conditions adopted at its early december meeting there was broad consensus among members that the recent rises in riskfree rates and gdpweighted sovereign yields required a scalingup of the pace of purchases under the pepp
2021-04-08;2021;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8235867023468018;since longerterm sovereign yields figured prominently among the key variables used to evaluate financing conditions and were indicative of future changes in other components of financing conditions a significant increase in the pace of pepp purchases for the next three months was widely seen as warranted
2021-04-08;2021;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9697492122650146;all in all members expressed broad support for mr lanes proposal to conduct purchases under the pepp over the next quarter at a significantly higher pace than during the first few months of the year
2021-04-08;2021;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9929560422897339;a significant increase in the purchase pace for the next three months was seen as warranted by the observed tightening of financing conditions and the lack of a material improvement in the growth and inflation outlook
2021-04-08;2021;April;REPORT;Positive;0.7881746888160706;the proposal was also deemed proportionate in the light of the ecbs mandate balancing increased optimism about the mediumterm outlook against the considerable uncertainty that still prevailed in the shorter term
2021-04-08;2021;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9899689555168152;consideration was given to the appropriate size of the increase in the pace of purchases
2021-04-08;2021;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9848854541778564;it was highlighted that to give a clear message to markets on the governing councils reaction function the purchase volume needed to be increased significantly as proposed by mr lane
2021-04-08;2021;April;REPORT;Positive;0.8395119309425354;this would send a strong signal that the governing council wanted to lean against the tightening of financing conditions
2021-04-08;2021;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9906870722770691;however it was also argued that a more moderate increase in the pace would better reflect the assessment of more balanced risks to the outlook also in the light of previous decisions when a similar pace had been chosen but economic conditions had been worse
2021-04-08;2021;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9906210899353027;although riskfree rates and gdpweighted sovereign bond yields had increased it was observed that this had occurred mostly on account of higher expected inflation and a better outlook for the global economy
2021-04-08;2021;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.6166563630104065;in this context it was remarked that the governing council needed to avoid giving the impression of being overly focused on sovereign yields or reacting mechanically to a set of indicators of financing conditions
2021-04-08;2021;April;REPORT;Negative;0.7103306651115417;moreover the view was put forward that the tightening might not be sizeable and persistent enough to affect broader financing conditions materially
2021-04-08;2021;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9857969880104065;overall there was wide agreement that the purchase pace needed to take into account a joint assessment of the favourability of current financing conditions and the inflation outlook
2021-04-08;2021;April;REPORT;Negative;0.7588154673576355;against this background all members joined a broad consensus around the proposal put forward by mr lane on the understanding that the total pepp envelope was not being called into question in the current conditions and that the pace of purchases could be reduced in the future
2021-04-08;2021;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9852086305618286;in this context the flexibility of purchases over time was seen as essential for reacting to changes in financing conditions as needed over time
2021-04-08;2021;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9933387637138367;the decision to accelerate the purchase pace significantly would show that the governing council was willing to use the flexibility of the programme without changing the overall envelope or duration of the programme
2021-04-08;2021;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9893602132797241;the envelope could however be recalibrated if required in order to maintain favourable financing conditions to help counter the negative pandemic shock to the path of inflation
2021-04-08;2021;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9410682320594788;equally if favourable financing conditions could be maintained with asset purchase flows that did not exhaust the envelope over the net purchase horizon of the pepp the envelope need not be used in full
2021-04-08;2021;April;REPORT;Negative;0.5228928923606873;it was underlined that the flexibility embodied in the pepp was symmetric implying that the purchase pace could be increased and decreased according to market conditions
2021-04-08;2021;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9909180402755737;looking ahead members agreed that the governing council would undertake a quarterly joint assessment of financing conditions and the inflation outlook in order to determine the pace of purchases needed to keep financing conditions favourable
2021-04-08;2021;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9830232262611389;at the same time it was also deemed important that in the intervening period flexibility in the pace of purchases continued to be applied according to market conditions
2021-04-08;2021;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9905076026916504;as regards communication it was seen as essential that the governing council reiterated its commitment to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments as appropriate to ensure that inflation moved towards its aim in a sustained manner in line with its commitment to symmetry
2021-04-08;2021;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9690144658088684;it was important to provide reassurance that the governing council would maintain an accommodative monetary policy for as long as necessary and saw no risk of overheating in the euro area in the present environment
2021-04-08;2021;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9853058457374573;finally in view of the sharp contraction of the euro area economy and the uneven recovery across sectors it was deemed important to emphasise the need for continued support from fiscal policies to sustain the recovery

2021-04-08;2021;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9886553287506104;first the governing council would continue to conduct net asset purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme pepp with a total envelope of 1850 billion until at least the end of march 2022 and in any case until it judged that the coronavirus crisis phase was over
2021-04-08;2021;April;REPORT;Positive;0.6794212460517883;based on a joint assessment of financing conditions and the inflation outlook the governing council expected purchases under the pepp over the next quarter to be conducted at a significantly higher pace than during the first months of the year
2021-04-08;2021;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9619469046592712;the governing council would purchase flexibly according to market conditions and with a view to preventing a tightening of financing conditions that was inconsistent with countering the downward impact of the pandemic on the projected path of inflation
2021-04-08;2021;April;REPORT;Positive;0.7451436519622803;in addition the flexibility of purchases over time across asset classes and among jurisdictions would continue to support the smooth transmission of monetary policy

2021-04-08;2021;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9897304773330688;the governing council would continue to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the pepp until at least the end of 2023 in any case the future rolloff of the pepp portfolio would be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance
2021-04-08;2021;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9796141982078552;second net purchases under the asset purchase programme app would continue at a monthly pace of 20 billion
2021-04-08;2021;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9931260347366333;the governing council continued to expect monthly net asset purchases under the app to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of its policy rates and to end shortly before it started raising the key ecb interest rates
2021-04-08;2021;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9726808667182922;the governing council also intended to continue reinvesting in full the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the app for an extended period of time past the date when it started raising the key ecb interest rates and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation
2021-04-08;2021;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9904327392578125;third the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility would remain unchanged at 000 025 and 050 respectively
2021-04-08;2021;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9919579029083252;the governing council expected the key ecb interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels until it had seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to but below 2 within its projection horizon and such convergence had been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics
2021-04-08;2021;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9712967276573181;finally the governing council would continue to provide ample liquidity through its refinancing operations
