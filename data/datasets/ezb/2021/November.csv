2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9942187070846558;in this respect the labour market was seen still to contain a substantial amount of hidden slack which was related to employees in job retention schemes and to restraints on mobility and migration
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8980767726898193;while the possibility of secondround effects was considered to be limited in the presence of labour market slack it was argued that price effects could be greater than currently estimated if labour force participation did not return to precrisis levels
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9626935124397278;moreover with infection rates still high and subsidies still generous under job retention schemes workers reservation wages might have increased although this effect was likely to vanish as the labour market normalised after the pandemic
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Positive;0.8961808681488037;while there was agreement that the bargaining power of trade unions and the scope for wage indexation had decreased over time it was pointed out that wage negotiations were now taking place against the background of high inflation rates well above the ecbs target
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9776026606559753;in their discussion members also recalled other factors that were relevant for the mediumterm inflation outlook
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.963973343372345;it was argued that thus far the projections did not include the rise in carbon prices that would be needed to reach the objectives set in the paris agreement
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8969732522964478;it was acknowledged that energy prices needed to rise in order to affect the behaviour of consumers and enterprises through relative price changes visàvis nonenergy components but the question was raised as to whether the ultimate effects of higher energy prices on economic activity and inflation would be positive or negative
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9082927703857422;related to this doubts were expressed about the use of typically downwardsloping oil price futures curves as projection assumptions when fossil fuel prices were bound to remain elevated or rise further
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9530892968177795;additionally growth of owneroccupied housing costs which at present were not included in the hicp had accelerated to a rate of 45 year on year in the second quarter of 2021 this was a source of concern at a time when the latest estimates suggested that owneroccupied housing would have contributed 0405 percentage points to inflation in the second quarter of the year according to an experimental hicp while the difference between such an experimentally augmented hicp and the official hicp would have amounted to 0203 percentage points
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.537246584892273;at the same time it was cautioned that this supplementary cost indicator should not always be expected to make a positive contribution to inflation as it partly reflected developments in house prices that could be subject to strong mean reversion over time
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9498410820960999;finally it was recalled that some of the models used in the macroeconomic projections might not adequately capture prevailing inflation dynamics as these were based on mean reversion to the low historical trend seen over the past few years
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.989822268486023;as regards inflation expectations members took note of the further increase in longerterm surveybased indicators and marketbased measures of inflation expectations that ms schnabel and mr lane had reported in their introductions
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9543153047561646;expectations were now seen as being close to or having already reached the 2 target
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Negative;0.8885293006896973;it was pointed out that this was only a gradual move towards levels more in line with the new inflation target and that such reanchoring should not be confused with an unanchoring on the upside
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9832748770713806;it was acknowledged that the individual expectations measures all had some methodological shortcomings such as a risk premium component or outliers but that it was useful to have a wide range of information which qualitatively all pointed in the same direction
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8474293947219849;the view was expressed that the longer the inflation spike lasted the more it would become entrenched in longerterm inflation expectations
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9791451692581177;it was also suggested that as indicated by the results of household surveys the way households and firms experienced inflation was quite different from the reading of macro data by market analysts and central banks
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9717483520507812;turning to the monetary and financial analysis members widely concurred with the assessment provided by mr lane in his introduction
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9445575475692749;bank lending rates for firms and households remained at historically low levels
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Negative;0.8770512938499451;the growth of loans to nonfinancial corporations remained moderate despite picking up in september
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Positive;0.48209941387176514;the most recent bank lending survey showed that credit conditions for firms had stabilised and were supported  for the first time since 2018  by a reduction in banks risk perceptions
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9909907579421997;it was remarked that the growth rate of lending to households for house purchase stood above 5  the highest level since 2008 at the same time bank balance sheets continued to be supported by favourable funding conditions and remained solid
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9946330785751343;monetary policy stance and policy considerations members widely concurred with the view that at the current juncture the accommodative monetary policy stance had to be reconfirmed and remained appropriate to support the convergence of inflation to the governing councils symmetric 2 target over the medium term
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.6603747010231018;in line with the governing councils new strategy monetary policy had to be patient in the light of the elevated uncertainty in order to support a selfsustained reanchoring of inflation expectations at the target
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Positive;0.5741523504257202;since the monetary policy space was constrained by the effective lower bound on interest rates the increase in the inflation rate was seen as an opportunity to reanchor inflation expectations solidly at the governing councils 2 target over the medium term
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9910474419593811;a continued accommodative monetary policy stance would also be in line with the governing councils new monetary policy strategy which called for policy to be persistent when interest rates were at the lower bound and explicitly allowed for inflation to moderately exceed the target for a transitory period
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Negative;0.8211696743965149;moreover it was conjectured that there had been no fundamental changes in the underlying causes of the low growth and low inflation environment prevailing prior to the pandemic
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Negative;0.6382701396942139;however it was also noted that despite the increase in nominal rates shortterm real interest rates had decreased
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8206978440284729;the remark was made that at some point in the future the very generous monetary policy support to the economy would need to be reassessed in view of the improved inflation outlook and be brought towards a more neutral configuration over time
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9424258470535278;contrary to the situation in the past decade the governing council was now increasingly facing a macroeconomic backdrop of deficient supply rather than deficient demand in an environment of rising inflation expectations and a fast improving labour market
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.611276388168335;at the same time it was recalled that the current macroeconomic outlook depended heavily on the monetary policy support that was in place
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Negative;0.6368404030799866;with regard to financing conditions it was noted that overall financial and financing conditions had remained favourable although market interest rates such as the tenyear ois rate and euro area sovereign bond yields had increased markedly since the governing councils previous quarterly assessment in september
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9607198238372803;the increase in the tenyear ois rate reflected exclusively an increase in measures of inflation compensation
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9047842025756836;a substantial part of the increase in inflation compensation in turn was attributed to an increase in the term premium related to spillovers from abroad
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9118159413337708;at the same time real interest rates had fallen and government and corporate bond spreads had remained contained
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Negative;0.6504105925559998;marketbased and bankbased financing conditions for firms and households remained at or close to historically supportive levels despite an increase in bank and corporate bond yields
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9817197918891907;concerns were voiced that expectations regarding the future path of shortterm money market interest rates were difficult to reconcile with the governing councils forward guidance on interest rates with market participants anticipating a much earlier date for the first rate increase than at the time of the governing councils september meeting
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8874512314796448;the question was raised as to whether market participants might misunderstand the three conditions laid out in the governing councils forward guidance that had to be satisfied before the first increase in policy rates
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9675471782684326;these conditions were that the governing council should see inflation reaching 2 i well ahead of the end of its projection horizon and ii durably for the rest of the projection horizon and that iii in the governing councils judgement realised progress in underlying inflation was sufficiently advanced to be consistent with inflation stabilising at 2 over the medium term
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9873213768005371;it was recalled that  in contrast to surveybased indicators  marketbased measures of inflation compensation and future interest rates contained term premia which had to be disentangled from the pure expectations component
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9640246629714966;the increase in term premia on account of the elevated uncertainty could potentially offer one explanation for the discrepancy between marketbased measures and surveybased indicators although both metrics had shifted significantly since the september meeting
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9073658585548401;two main reasons for this shift were discussed
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9133665561676025;on the one hand the significant increase in marketbased measures of inflation compensation across the maturity spectrum including over the medium term suggested that market participants judged that the interest rate liftoff conditions would be met earlier than the governing council anticipated
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9905191659927368;consistent with the automatic stabiliser function inherent in the governing councils forward guidance it was reasonable to expect changes in the expected time to liftoff as inflation expectations rose
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Positive;0.54332035779953;this suggested that the forward guidance remained credible and that it had contributed to a further easing of financing conditions by lowering real short and mediumterm interest rates
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.5479720830917358;in this context it was noted that there was now a gap between the future path of inflation implied by inflation swap markets and the september 2021 ecb staff projections and attention was drawn to the recent persistent underestimation of inflation in recent staff macroeconomic projections
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Negative;0.8926759362220764;on the other hand market participants were possibly questioning the credibility of the governing councils forward guidance
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9122392535209656;in this context it was stressed that the governing council had to reaffirm all three conditions of its forward guidance and its determination to act forcefully and persistently in line with its revised monetary policy strategy in order to anchor inflation expectations solidly at its 2 target
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.822523295879364;equally the governing council had to reaffirm its assessment that inflation would decline in the course of next year and could still be expected to settle below the ecbs 2 target over the projection horizon
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.4963228106498718;it was underlined that by explicitly stressing the need for durability of the underlying inflation developments the governing councils forward guidance was particularly well suited to looking through costpush shocks such as the ones being experienced
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9813716411590576;members concurred that the current and nearterm increase in inflation was driven largely by temporary factors that would fade in the medium term
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.7502836585044861;at the same time members agreed that price pressures were more persistent than had been foreseen in the september ecb staff projections
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9506922364234924;although it was judged that secondround effects were not visible so far mediumterm price pressures needed to be monitored closely
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.41647517681121826;in this context it was noted that mediumterm inflation expectations  not just those of market participants but also those of economic agents in general  remained well anchored and generally below the 2 target
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9778885841369629;overall it was acknowledged that the mediumterm inflation outlook had improved
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9938260912895203;although the governing councils focus on the mediumterm inflation outlook suggested looking through the projected humpshaped path for inflation that resulted from the temporary nature of the current factors affecting the inflation outlook the uncertainty around the mediumterm prospects was seen as elevated
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8708599209785461;while an increase in the upside risks to inflation had to be acknowledged it was deemed important for the governing council to avoid an overreaction as well as unwarranted inaction and to keep sufficient optionality in calibrating its monetary policy measures to address all inflation scenarios that might unfold
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9824773669242859;based on the joint assessment of financing conditions and the inflation outlook all members agreed with mr lanes proposal to continue conducting net asset purchases under the pepp at a moderately lower pace during the final quarter of the year compared with the previous two quarters while confirming all other monetary policy measures namely the level of the key ecb interest rates the governing councils forward guidance on their likely future evolution the purchases under the asset purchase programme app the reinvestment policies and the longerterm refinancing operations
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9896054267883301;with regard to the upcoming governing council meeting in december the view was held that judging on the basis of the current developments net purchases under the pepp could be expected to come to an end by march 2022 in line with the date that the governing council had announced in its previous communication
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9924463629722595;at the same time it was highlighted that monetary policy decisions needed to be datadriven and all incoming data during the coming months needed to be taken into account
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Negative;0.8896825909614563;while the governing council would benefit from new staff macroeconomic projections at its december meeting it was cautioned that the data available in december would not resolve all the uncertainties around the mediumterm inflation outlook
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.802369236946106;it was seen as important that the governing council should keep sufficient optionality to allow for future monetary policy actions including beyond its december meeting
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9158241152763367;monetary policy decisions and communication regarding communication it was stressed that in view of the significant shift in the path of shortterm money market rates the governing council had to reaffirm its forward guidance and its assessment that while inflation would take longer to decline than previously expected in the medium term it was foreseen as remaining below the 2 target
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.981905460357666;in this context it was necessary to stress the mediumterm inflation outlook and the governing councils determination to act forcefully and persistently in line with its revised monetary policy strategy to anchor inflation expectations solidly at its 2 target
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Negative;0.8702417016029358;at the same time it had to be acknowledged that some of the upside risks to the september 2021 staff projections had materialised and that the recent uptick in inflation was expected to be more persistent than previously anticipated
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9835448861122131;taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members upon a proposal by the president the governing council took the following monetary policy decisions which are set out in more detail in the corresponding ecb press release
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Negative;0.8755097389221191;the governing council continued to judge that favourable financing conditions could be maintained with a moderately lower pace of net asset purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme pepp than in the second and third quarters of the year
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9889428615570068;the governing council also confirmed its other measures namely the level of the key ecb interest rates its forward guidance on their likely future evolution its purchases under the asset purchase programme app its reinvestment policies and its longerterm refinancing operations
2021-11-25;2021;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9926716089248657;the governing council reiterated that it stood ready to adjust all of its instruments as appropriate to ensure that inflation stabilised at its 2 target over the medium term
