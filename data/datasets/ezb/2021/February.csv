2021-02-18;2021;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9929543137550354;however underlying price pressures were expected to remain subdued owing to weak demand notably in the tourism and travelrelated sectors as well as to low wage pressures and the appreciation of the euro
2021-02-18;2021;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9791186451911926;once the impact of the pandemic had faded a recovery in demand supported by accommodative fiscal and monetary policies would put upward pressure on inflation over the medium term

2021-02-18;2021;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9911794066429138;in discussing recent inflation developments members agreed that while broadly in line with the december 2020 staff projections headline inflation was at a very low level and in december underlying inflation had reached a historical low
2021-02-18;2021;February;REPORT;Negative;0.976920485496521;although stronger global demand and higher commodity prices would help to push up inflation price pressures generally remained subdued so that achieving a robust convergence to the ecbs mediumterm inflation aim remained a challenge with favourable developments for the economy and inflation all being contingent on progress in curbing the spread of the pandemic
2021-02-18;2021;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9780069589614868;it was emphasised that the mediumterm outlook for inflation was surrounded by a high level of uncertainty given the unprecedented pandemic situation and longstanding questions about changes in the underlying determinants of inflation
2021-02-18;2021;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9815464615821838;this elevated uncertainty was related not only to the strength of the postpandemic economic recovery but also to the relative importance of demand versus supply factors in different sectors of the economy and to questions about the strength of passthrough from financing conditions to inflation
2021-02-18;2021;February;REPORT;Negative;0.7576563358306885;in addition there continued to be acute measurement issues related to the relevant weights in the price indices during the pandemic period
2021-02-18;2021;February;REPORT;Negative;0.7678017020225525;the projected gradual recovery in inflation in the baseline scenario was seen to remain broadly valid but it was highlighted that inflation was only projected to be 14 in 2023 at the same time there appeared to be little risk of deflation at this juncture with inflation expected to rise in the short term owing to higher energy prices and the reversal of a temporary tax reduction in one jurisdiction together with the rapid recovery in activity expected after restrictions were lifted
2021-02-18;2021;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9836084246635437;it could also not be ruled out that in the course of 2021 inflation dynamics might be stronger than foreseen in the projections at least temporarily in the light of global developments and especially if there was a stronger than expected rebound in activity in the second half of the year
2021-02-18;2021;February;REPORT;Negative;0.6896645426750183;the point was made however that such a temporary boost to inflation should not be mistaken for a sustained increase which was still likely to emerge only slowly
2021-02-18;2021;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9694288969039917;members reviewed the latest exchange rate developments noting that the recent persistent trend appreciation of the euro had reversed since the start of 2021 possible adverse implications of a further appreciation of the euro for the inflation outlook were reiterated

2021-02-18;2021;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.915039598941803;it was also noted however that the increase in marketbased measures in the euro area was mainly due to global factors
2021-02-18;2021;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.984751284122467;turning to the monetary analysis members broadly agreed with the assessment provided by mr lane in his introduction

2021-02-18;2021;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9759441614151001;it was highlighted that recent money growth had been mainly due to the eurosystems ongoing asset purchases with monetary dynamics therefore driven more by developments on the asset side than on the liability side of the eurosystem balance sheet
2021-02-18;2021;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9607816934585571;attention was drawn to the recent developments in loans to the private sector which had been characterised by moderate lending to nonfinancial corporations and resilient lending to households
2021-02-18;2021;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9847737550735474;it was noted that at 69 the annual growth rate of lending to nonfinancial corporations appeared robust
2021-02-18;2021;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9946781396865845;however this was mainly reflecting the very strong increase in lending in the first half of the year while the monthly lending flows had moderated since the end of the summer which could translate into weak investment dynamics over time
2021-02-18;2021;February;REPORT;Negative;0.8404272794723511;however it was also argued that firms had built up sizeable precautionary buffers and the recent slowdown in credit should not be interpreted as the start of a financial amplification cycle

2021-02-18;2021;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9927331209182739;this tightening was mainly driven by heightened risk perceptions among banks in a context of continued uncertainty about the economic recovery and concerns about borrower creditworthiness

2021-02-18;2021;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9947210550308228;on the one hand it was argued that the results of the bls warranted careful monitoring as they could signal a further tightening ahead with corresponding negative consequences for credit flows and economic activity
2021-02-18;2021;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9946119785308838;in addition the results highlighted the role of structural weaknesses in the euro area banking sector such as overcapacity high npls low profitability and slow progress on digitalisation
2021-02-18;2021;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9819230437278748;on the other hand it was recalled that reported credit standards had tightened much less than in previous crisis episodes while stateguaranteed loans had led to a significant relaxation of credit standards in the second quarter and the recent tightening thus could be interpreted as a return to more normal conditions
2021-02-18;2021;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9844214916229248;monetary policy stance and policy considerations members took note of the assessments of financial and financing conditions provided by ms schnabel and mr lane in their introductions which had remained favourable since the governing councils meeting in december also on account of the ecbs recalibrated monetary policy package which had been well received by financial markets
