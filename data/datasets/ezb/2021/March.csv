2021-03-11;2021;March;REPORT;Positive;0.6171349287033081;the upswing in headline inflation reflects a number of idiosyncratic factors such as the end of the temporary vat rate reduction in germany delayed sales periods in some euro area countries and the impact of the stronger than usual changes in hicp weights for 2021 as well as higher energy price inflation
