2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9895464777946472;monetary policy considerations and policy options summing up mr lane noted that in implementing the new monetary policy strategy it was important to update the governing councils forward guidance on the key ecb interest rates
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Negative;0.8532626032829285;a commitment to maintain monetary accommodation on a persistent basis was essential in view of the effective lower bound constraint and the shortfall in the mediumterm inflation outlook relative to the two per cent target
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9682906866073608;the new strategy incorporated two key innovations which should be reflected in the ecbs forward guidance on interest rates first the redefinition of the ecbs price stability objective as a two per cent inflation target over the medium term and second a conditional commitment to take into account the implications of the effective lower bound when conducting monetary policy in an environment of structurally low nominal interest rates
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9884572625160217;under the current conditions forward guidance would reinforce the commitment to attaining the inflation target by clarifying that the policy rates would be raised only if the evidence was sufficiently robust to allow the governing council to expect with a high degree of confidence that the inflation rate would reach two per cent on a durable basis
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.8261247873306274;in practice the proposed new forward guidance would serve two distinct purposes first it would provide a concrete operationalisation of the concept of robust convergence of inflation to the new target and second it would reflect the clear need for the ecbs policy reaction to be especially persistent in conditions such as at present in which nominal interest rates had been close to their lower bound for some time and the outlook for inflation was still well below the target
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.5387539267539978;a recalibrated forward guidance should contain three key conditions that should be met before interest rates were raised first inflation should reach the target well in advance of the end of the projection horizon in order to ensure that the liftoff decision was based on firm foundations and not exposed to the volatility of longerhorizon projection errors second the governing council should be confident that the target would be reached on a durable basis and third the governing council should not consider raising rates unless underlying inflation was also judged to have made satisfactory progress towards two per cent
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9853920340538025;this was an extra safeguard against a policy tightening in the face of costpush shocks that might elevate headline inflation temporarily but fade quickly
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Positive;0.886059582233429;finally a preamble should make clear that the new guidance was in the service of ensuring robust convergence to the target over the medium term
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.894096851348877;in line with these principles mr lane proposed the following reformulation in order to ensure robust convergence to the two per cent inflation target over the medium term the governing council expects the key ecb interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels until we see inflation reaching two per cent well ahead of the end of our projection horizon and on a durable basis and we judge that realised progress in underlying inflation towards two per cent is sufficiently advanced
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9641370177268982;first by stipulating that inflation should be expected to reach the target well ahead of the end of our projection horizon the new forward guidance would give reassurance that the rise in inflation to two per cent at the time of a rate liftoff should not be expected to occur only at the end point of the horizon
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Positive;0.6424945592880249;this earlier convergence to the target also helped to hedge monetary policy against the risk of reacting to forecast errors which tended to be larger at longer horizons
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9812290668487549;second by stating that the inflation target should be reached on a durable basis the governing council would signal that the target would be attained on a lasting basis rather than as the result of shortlived forces that led to oneoff price increases but were unlikely to lead to persistently higher yearonyear inflation
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9897095561027527;for that purpose the governing council needed to look beyond the initial threshold of well ahead of the end of the projection horizon to see whether the inflation target was expected to be reached on a durable basis
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9924284815788269;in both dimensions the forward guidance was formulated as an expectation of the governing council rather than being mechanically linked to staff projections
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9931871891021729;this formulation would also keep an element of the focus on current developments by retaining the reference to underlying inflation
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9829179644584656;specifically the third condition would imply that the realised progress in underlying inflation towards two per cent is sufficiently advanced at the time of a rate hike
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.7844289541244507;this additional condition would provide added insurance against a premature policy reaction to transitory and possibly contractionary price shocks
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9861802458763123;it was important to keep in mind that underlying inflation was a broad concept  it was the persistent component of inflation that provided the best guide to future inflation developments and was not proxied by any single indicator in view of the statecontingent nature of the forces shaping underlying inflation trends
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9571585059165955;some other elements of the new forward guidance were important to note
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Positive;0.9690800905227661;first the forward guidance remained statecontingent and would continue to provide a powerful automatic stabilisation mechanism

2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9890676140785217;given that the conclusion of the strategy review had been announced only two weeks prior to the current monetary policy meeting it was highlighted that changes in the forward guidance would shape market participants understanding of the new strategy and could be seen as a first test of the revised strategy itself
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9860179424285889;it was underlined that the new strategy had been agreed unanimously and provided the governing council with a shared framework
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9306532740592957;the strategy incorporated two key innovations which needed to be reflected in the forward guidance
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9919145107269287;first it provided a numerical clarification of the price stability objective by specifying an explicit two per cent symmetric inflation target
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9880782961845398;second it included a conditional commitment to take into account the implications of the effective lower bound when setting monetary policy in an environment of structurally low nominal interest rates including through the adoption of more forceful or persistent policy measures
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.8748244047164917;the need to revise the forward guidance on interest rates was emphasised in order to provide a credible commitment to bringing inflation up to the new target
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.952601432800293;it was also seen as essential to provide safeguards against a premature tightening of monetary policy in the current environment
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9857940077781677;it was also recalled that forward guidance was a statecontingent instrument that expressed monetary policy intentions rather than being a fixed commitment to a predetermined policy path
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9890080690383911;the forward guidance was always based on the governing councils current assessment of the outlook for price stability
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9477227926254272;hence the governing council retained discretion and judgement and the guidance could change as circumstances evolved
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9585327506065369;moreover as the forward guidance was not mechanically linked to the staff projections the governing council retained flexibility to exercise its own judgement regarding the inflation outlook
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9866164922714233;the reformulated forward guidance was best understood as a set of conditions that would help guide the ecbs actions in pursuit of its inflation target as defined in the new strategy
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9672961831092834;it did not necessarily imply lower for longer interest rates if it ultimately succeeded in anchoring inflation expectations at the target as intended
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.988756000995636;accordingly it was remarked that forward guidance on interest rates if credible should reduce the extent to which other instruments needed to be deployed
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9784529805183411;against this background the new formulation of the forward guidance proposed by mr lane was widely seen as finely balanced
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9930887818336487;it reflected the new symmetric inflation target of two per cent and the conditional commitment to take into account the implications of the effective lower bound when conducting policy in an environment of structurally low nominal interest rates
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.5061098337173462;in particular by stipulating more specific outlookbased and outcomebased conditions to be met before interest rates were raised it underlined the need for persistence in the accommodative policy stance
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Positive;0.9661277532577515;this would help avoid a premature tightening of the stance and ensure a robust convergence of inflation to the target in the medium term
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.7493911981582642;in this regard it was noted that the forward guidance language should clearly dispel the notion that two per cent was a ceiling for inflation given that the new strategy explicitly allowed for a moderate and transitory overshooting
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.8743575215339661;in the discussion members put forward a number of considerations
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.7623617053031921;on the one hand the case was made for strengthening the forward guidance on interest rates even further
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9930237531661987;first policy rates remained constrained by the lower bound
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Negative;0.990519642829895;second mediumterm inflation expectations continued to stand below the inflation target
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.8565194010734558;third markets were pricing in a liftoff of the key ecb policy rates at a time when inflation over the medium term was still expected to be well below two per cent
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9170952439308167;this could be interpreted as a sign that the current forward guidance was insufficient to guide market expectations
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.976314902305603;from this perspective it was felt that the forward guidance could be strengthened by formulating the liftoff conditions in terms of realised inflation rather than expected inflation
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.5717170238494873;the point was made that stepping up the forward guidance now and scaling it back later when necessary would be better for credibility than having to scale up the guidance later
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9458826780319214;on the other hand it was cautioned that requiring inflation to durably reach two per cent at an earlier point in time would risk undermining the mediumterm orientation of monetary policy
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9739171862602234;in addition given the significant lags with which monetary policy was transmitted to the real economy it would amount to intentionally overshooting the inflation target
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Positive;0.943213939666748;in this regard it was recalled that other instruments were continuing to provide strong monetary policy support at the lower bound
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Negative;0.8721898794174194;the point was made that some loosening of the monetary policy stance would occur automatically without substantial changes to the forward guidance because the somewhat higher inflation target in the new strategy would in any case likely imply a postponement of the liftoff date
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Positive;0.9081869721412659;the credibility of the governing councils forward guidance was seen as key to its success
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.7805720567703247;it was noted that the further into the future forward guidance extended the less credible the commitment was likely to be
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9682483077049255;under the forward guidance in place at the time of the meeting markets were not expecting the liftoff until 2024 and were pricing in negative policy rates until 2028 moreover the argument was made that the proposed formulation could prove too ambitious and hence jeopardise credibility by risking a break with the stipulated conditions later on
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Negative;0.8293030858039856;a suggestion was made to include knockout clauses in the forward guidance as a possible means to enhance credibility mitigate financial stability risks and underscore that the governing council was just as concerned about inflation being too high as it was about inflation being too low
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9796472787857056;at the same time it was underlined that the strategy itself provided a safeguard by stipulating that only temporary and moderate overshoots of inflation would be consistent with price stability over the medium term
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.985645055770874;against this background members exchanged views on how to formulate the three conditions in the recalibrated forward guidance set out in the proposal by mr lane
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9437460899353027;with regard to the first condition it was remarked that the phrase well ahead was essential in order to avoid referring only to the end of the projection horizon which was seen as subject to greater uncertainty than shorterterm forecasts
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9921234250068665;given projection errors preferences were expressed to formulate the first condition in terms of realised inflation rather than projected inflation
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Positive;0.9750208258628845;this might help avoid a premature tightening of the monetary policy stance strengthen the credibility of the guidance and provide greater clarity to markets
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Negative;0.967999279499054;at the same time concerns were raised that the phrase well ahead could be perceived as deviating from the mediumterm orientation of the monetary policy strategy
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9850517511367798;however it was clarified that specifying a condition in terms of a relatively earlier convergence within the projection horizon did not mean altering the concept of the medium term
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9769135117530823;with regard to the second condition outlined by mr lane the phrase on a durable basis was seen to provide flexibility by allowing for small oscillations around the target level
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9822616577148438;however concerns were raised that the phrase was too vague to sufficiently anchor expectations as suggested by experience with the current formulation of forward guidance
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9935863614082336;it was argued that the notion of durability could be reinforced by referring explicitly to the level of inflation over the remainder of the projection horizon
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9934307932853699;in this regard and in view of the symmetric nature of the inflation target it was suggested that reference could be made for example to inflation not falling below or staying above two per cent over the forecast horizon
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.6680914163589478;it was acknowledged that such a reformulation of interest rate forward guidance would imply an almost certain overshoot of the two per cent inflation target
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9557271003723145;such overshooting if temporary and moderate could however be seen as fully in line with the new strategy
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Negative;0.8626605868339539;at the same time it was argued that requiring inflation not to fall below the target would effectively amount to intentionally overshooting which was viewed as inconsistent with the strategy
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Negative;0.664327085018158;it was also remarked that because there was no explicit safeguard ensuring that any potential overshoot would be moderate maintaining price stability could give rise to the need for a rapid increase in policy rates once the conditions of the interest rate forward guidance had been met
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9845882058143616;such a swift tightening of policy rates at a later stage might then not prove easy to pursue or might give rise to financial stability risks exacerbating the initial overshoot
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9814361929893494;this needed to be taken into account in the proportionality analysis
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9660115838050842;against this background there was broad support for including an explicit reference to the ecbs agreed monetary policy strategy statement on overshooting in the communication on forward guidance in order to address potential misunderstandings
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9853665828704834;with regard to the third condition referring to underlying inflation was seen as an effective means to safeguard against a premature tightening of monetary policy in response to forecast errors or to supplyside shocks that might affect headline inflation only temporarily
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9844210147857666;however a concern was expressed that the phrase realised progress in underlying inflation towards two per cent is sufficiently advanced could be misinterpreted as suggesting that the governing council had a separate two per cent target for underlying inflation
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9368741512298584;moreover the point was made that such a perceived target for underlying inflation would effectively render the guidance rather ambitious because standard measures of underlying inflation in particular core inflation excluding food and energy had typically been well below headline inflation in the euro area historically
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.5264569520950317;it was also remarked that there were multiple measures of underlying inflation and therefore the reference might be viewed as ambiguous and leaving ample room for discretion
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9737609624862671;reflecting the balance of the arguments overwhelming support emerged around an amended version of the forward guidance proposal by mr lane
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9911888837814331;the notion of robust convergence was further clarified by the inclusion of the phrase durably for the rest of the projection horizon with reference to inflation reaching two per cent
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.985181450843811;the inclusion of language from the new strategy statement  namely a reference to the target being symmetric and the possibility of a transitory period in which inflation could be moderately above target  would place the forward guidance firmly within the strategy framework
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9581355452537537;it would also act as a safeguard against persistent or pronounced overshooting
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9881808757781982;the phrase underlying inflation is sufficiently advanced to be consistent with inflation stabilising at two per cent made it clear that the target was headline inflation not underlying inflation
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9928609728813171;turning to proportionality considerations the proposed revisions to the forward guidance on interest rates were generally assessed to be a proportionate response to the risks to the governing councils price stability mandate
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.7707769274711609;experience with forward guidance suggested that it had been an effective tool for steering market expectations regarding interest rates thereby helping to bring inflation closer to the governing councils target
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9811898469924927;the proposed reformulation was also viewed as efficient compared with alternative policy options
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Negative;0.586641788482666;while forward guidance could in part substitute for the use of other instruments that might have more pronounced side effects it was remarked that a recalibration of the interest rate forward guidance could be erroneously perceived by market participants as necessarily implying a longer period of net asset purchases owing to the link between rate guidance and forward guidance on the asset purchase programme app
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9800015091896057;there was general agreement to defer the discussion on the app forward guidance to a future meeting
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9252658486366272;the governing council continued to assess the benefits of negative policy rates as outweighing their costs although the longer negative rates remained in place the greater the likelihood of the balance of risks shifting to the downside
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9854617118835449;against this background a large majority of members indicated that they could support the revised forward guidance proposal
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9544026851654053;the proposal was widely seen as providing a fine balance between greater emphasis on outcomebased elements in the forward guidance and a more flexible forwardlooking perspective
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9154370427131653;after the unanimous agreement on the new strategy broad consensus on forward guidance was generally regarded as of great importance
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9097155332565308;at the same time a few members upheld their reservations as the amended formulation did not sufficiently address their concerns
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Negative;0.8722561001777649;these related in particular to the implied likelihood and persistence of overshooting and being seen as promising to keep interest rates at their present or lower levels for a very long time period without an explicit escape clause
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9899438619613647;turning to other elements of the stance assessment members concurred with mr lane that incoming information had broadly confirmed the joint assessment of financing conditions and the inflation outlook carried out at the june monetary policy meeting
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.8326077461242676;accordingly it was agreed to continue to conduct net asset purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme in the third quarter at a significantly higher pace than during the first months of the year

2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.5823079943656921;the forward guidance underscored the governing councils commitment to achieving its new inflation target and indicated that it would wait until it was confident about the path of inflation before raising the key policy rates
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Positive;0.5596321821212769;the guidance was not a rule but rather provided an indication to financial markets and the broader public so they could better align their inflation expectations with the governing councils target
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.991642951965332;it was essential to emphasise that the forward guidance remained consistent with the mediumterm orientation of monetary policy which remained distinct from the projection horizon
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9836646914482117;in this regard it was nonetheless seen as helpful to clarify the notion of well ahead which could be specified as referring to the midpoint of the projection horizon for practical purposes
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9896178841590881;it was noted that only the forward guidance on interest rates had been adjusted and that the forward guidance on asset purchases remained unchanged for the time being
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9460306763648987;the point was made that the governing council had already been reacting forcefully for some time to the challenges posed by the effective lower bound using a range of instruments
2021-08-26;2021;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.7278534770011902;highlighting this could help to dispel any notions that the reformulation of the forward guidance was a novel or delayed reaction to the lower bound problem calling for imminent deployment of further policy measures
