2001-06-21;2001;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9771698117256165;against the background of available information the current level of ecb key interest rates remains appropriate to ensure that the euro area economy will be able to maintain price stability in the medium term
2001-06-21;2001;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9875617027282715;as regards the first pillar no new data on monetary developments have become available since 7 june so that our previous assessment remains unchanged
2001-06-21;2001;June;REPORT;Negative;0.994188666343689;concerning the second pillar recently published data on real gdp growth in the first quarter of 2001 as well as on industrial production in april 2001 pointed to a moderation of economic activity in the euro area and the latest information on global economic developments continues to suggest significant uncertainty
2001-06-21;2001;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.8144996166229248;in addition as i already indicated two weeks ago hicp inflation rose further to 34 in may
2001-06-21;2001;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9708263874053955;price developments continued to reflect mainly temporary upward pressure from energy and food prices which was taken into account in our previous decisions
2001-06-21;2001;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9868226051330566;overall the latest information did not change our assessment of the outlook for price stability over the medium term
2001-06-21;2001;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9698073863983154;we continue to expect the currently high rates of inflation to remain a transitory phenomenon and in the absence of further unfavourable price shocks inflation rates should fall below 2 in 2002 these developments are expected to take place in an environment of weaker economic growth which should however remain broadly in line with trend potential growth of the euro area
2001-06-21;2001;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.8466076850891113;we will continue to remain vigilant as regards future developments affecting the balance of risks to price stability including  in particular  monetary developments real gdp growth price setting behaviour and wage developments
2001-06-21;2001;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9232125878334045;at this juncture at which price developments are affected mainly by transitory factors it is crucial that the current upward movement of prices does not become more lasting and it is therefore important that wage moderation is continued
2001-06-21;2001;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9814899563789368;i should like to take the opportunity offered by this special meeting to make a few remarks on what is often referred to as a one size fits all monetary policy
2001-06-21;2001;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.815579891204834;in this connection i will address a few issues related to the ongoing discussions about the degree of convergence in the euro area
2001-06-21;2001;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9838040471076965;itis indeed not surprising that many academics and market analysts devote much of their research to one of the most interesting questions in contemporary economics namely the conduct of monetary and economic policies in a currency area extending from finland to portugal and from greece to ireland and encompassing one decisionmaking body for monetary policy and many more actors for other fields of responsibility
2001-06-21;2001;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9899762272834778;concerning monetary policy it is obvious that the governing council of the ecb can only pursue one objective  the maintenance of price stability in the euro area as a whole
2001-06-21;2001;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9805817008018494;in doing so it needs to adopt an areawide perspective in its assessment of economic conditions and the outlook for price stability
2001-06-21;2001;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9913219809532166;such an areawide perspective of course applies to all central banks in the world which are responsible for conducting monetary policy
2001-06-21;2001;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9877449870109558;the governing council has defined price stability with a focus on the euro area namely as yearonyear increases in the hicp for the euro area of below 2
2001-06-21;2001;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9811202883720398;this definition applies to the medium term
2001-06-21;2001;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9857898354530334;the governing councils monetary policy decisions are based on an areawide analytical framework its now wellknown twopillar strategy
2001-06-21;2001;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9901978969573975;the first pillar assigns a prominent role to monetary developments in the euro area and the second pillar encompasses a wide range of other economic and financial variables  again exclusively with a euro areawide perspective
2001-06-21;2001;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9879798889160156;underpinned by this twopillar analysis the governing council then arrives at an overall assessment and sets the ecb key interest rates with a view to maintaining price stability for the euro area in the medium term
2001-06-21;2001;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9934677481651306;these are the basics of our approach to conducting the single monetary policy for the euro area as a whole
2001-06-21;2001;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9922175407409668;evidently a single monetary policy for a group of 12 countries does not imply the same economic developments in the same year in all countries alike nor does it imply identical developments in individual regions or sectors within a country
2001-06-21;2001;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9644879698753357;rather real gdp growth may differ and there may be differences in unemployment rates or other important economic variables ie
2001-06-21;2001;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9664748311042786;there may be regional differences as is the case in all large economic and monetary areas of the world
2001-06-21;2001;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.8820562362670898;such differences are unavoidable and have existed within countries since way back
2001-06-21;2001;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.957412838935852;in many respects they reflect differences in the quality and in the success of the economic policies of individual countries comprising the euro area
2001-06-21;2001;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9878325462341309;successful policies enlarge a countrys production potential by means of structural reform ensure a flexible functioning of the economy to fully exploit this potential and ultimately increase per capita income enhance employment growth and reduce unemployment
2001-06-21;2001;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9720669388771057;as a consequence successful countries also achieve sound fiscal positions in combination with diminishing taxation
2001-06-21;2001;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.4905241131782532;as we are well aware there are examples among the euro area countries where such highly positive developments have taken place in the recent past
2001-06-21;2001;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9440779089927673;these examples clearly demonstrate that there is ample room for competition in the field of best practices
2001-06-21;2001;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.99277263879776;the most successful countries will eventually provide a benchmark against which other countries will be measured
2001-06-21;2001;June;REPORT;Negative;0.8868221640586853;however there are types of divergence that can be a matter of concern
2001-06-21;2001;June;REPORT;Negative;0.7183327674865723;here i would refer in particular to a situation marked by high rates of national inflation as a result of excessive wage increases an unsustainable expansion of profit margins andor an expansionary stance in fiscal policy
2001-06-21;2001;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9891462326049805;if such developments were to become entrenched in the economy this would lead to a loss in competitiveness and eventually to a loss in output and employment growth
2001-06-21;2001;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9883374571800232;while there is no way for the single monetary policy to take responsibility for such national developments just as there is no possibility for national authorities to adjust nominal exchange rates within the euro area after having adopted the single currency national economic policies must contribute to avoiding a situation which would subsequently require painful adjustment
2001-06-21;2001;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9771046042442322;for this purpose a wide range of national economic policies is available  such as fiscal adjustment appropriate wage setting structural reforms and competition policy
2001-06-21;2001;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.973308801651001;making use of them is not only in the interest of the euro area but also to the benefit of the individual country itself
2001-06-21;2001;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9235125184059143;to sum up a single monetary policy for a group of 12 countries can function smoothly
2001-06-21;2001;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9831336140632629;looking back over the first two and half years since the start of the single monetary policy there can be no doubt that macroeconomic developments in the euro area have been very favourable
2001-06-21;2001;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9575735926628113;divergences within the euro area are likely also to exist in future
2001-06-21;2001;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.7167702913284302;for the euro area to function smoothly however wellbalanced national economic policies should complement the single monetary policy with its primary objective of maintaining price stability in the euro area as a whole
