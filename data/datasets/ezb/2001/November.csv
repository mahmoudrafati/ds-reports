2001-11-08;2001;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9601636528968811;as a result the governing council decided to lower the key ecb interest rates by 50 basis points

2001-11-08;2001;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9933324456214905;in assessing the information which has accumulated over the past few weeks we concluded that inflationary pressures have further diminished
2001-11-08;2001;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9805498719215393;this was particularly apparent from the information under the second pillar of the ecbs monetary policy strategy while information relating to the first pillar was also judged consistent with todays decision

2001-11-08;2001;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9861745834350586;let me elaborate somewhat on the assessment provided under the two pillars of the monetary policy strategy of the ecb
2001-11-08;2001;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9767252802848816;with regard to the first pillar after having grown at a strong pace over the previous few months m3 growth increased further in september
2001-11-08;2001;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9276332855224609;however the recent evolution needs to be seen as a reflection of an increased liquidity preference of investors in an environment of a relatively flat yield curve until august developments in global stock markets and a surge in financial market uncertainty following the terrorist attacks of 11 september
2001-11-08;2001;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9946315288543701;in addition the growth of credit to the private sector has continued to decline over recent months
2001-11-08;2001;November;REPORT;Negative;0.7439466118812561;overall despite the acceleration in m3 growth current monetary developments do not signal risks to price stability in the medium term
2001-11-08;2001;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.974599301815033;we will continue to closely examine the underlying dynamics of monetary growth
2001-11-08;2001;November;REPORT;Positive;0.48405587673187256;regarding the second pillar much clearer signals of a further reduction of inflationary pressures from the demand side have accumulated over recent weeks
2001-11-08;2001;November;REPORT;Negative;0.993928074836731;euro area real gdp growth will be weak in the second half of 2001 this is to be seen against the background of the ongoing weakness of the world economy which depresses the demand for euro area exports
2001-11-08;2001;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9907613396644592;as a consequence and also taking into account the high degree of uncertainty following the terrorist attacks of 11 september the current environment is likely to lead to delays in investment activity and to some extent also to negatively affect private consumption growth in the euro area
2001-11-08;2001;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9867439270019531;real gdp growth in the euro area is expected to remain below potential growth also for part of next year
2001-11-08;2001;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9798895120620728;further ahead however the conditions exist for a recovery to take place in the course of 2002 and economic growth to return to a more satisfactory path
2001-11-08;2001;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8002349734306335;the uncertainty currently overshadowing the world economy should diminish and there are no major imbalances in the euro area which would require longerterm adjustment
2001-11-08;2001;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.7380732893943787;economic policies in the euro area as a whole remain geared towards price stability the objectives of the stability and growth pact wage moderation and structural reform
2001-11-08;2001;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9918789863586426;further positive effects on economic growth should stem from the impact of tax reductions in several member countries and from the fact that financing conditions are favourable
2001-11-08;2001;November;REPORT;Negative;0.8207259774208069;as regards the outlook for prices in the euro area recent developments confirm our earlier expectation of a gradual decline in inflation rates resulting from the unwinding of the previous increase in energy prices and the absence of further shocks to food prices
2001-11-08;2001;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.6353803873062134;in addition and crucial for the medium term two factors support the view that wage developments are less of a risk than was previously the case
2001-11-08;2001;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9901540875434875;first the slowdown in economic activity should contribute to containing inflationary pressure stemming from the labour market
2001-11-08;2001;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9747635126113892;second there is now sufficient evidence that the increase in consumer price inflation was temporary and this will help to keep inflation expectations low
2001-11-08;2001;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.980461061000824;looking forward inflation rates over the next few months will probably show some volatility on account of base effects resulting from previous price movements
2001-11-08;2001;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9697060585021973;however such shortterm fluctuations should not distract from the mediumterm trend
2001-11-08;2001;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8939659595489502;we can now expect that price stability will be safely restored in 2002 this view is confirmed by bond yield developments which are consistent with financial markets expecting inflation rates in the euro area to be clearly below 2 over the medium term
2001-11-08;2001;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.6135113835334778;overall as our assessment now points to a further abatement of inflationary pressures this allowed us to reduce the key ecb interest rates by 50 basis points
2001-11-08;2001;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9689047932624817;this follows three previous interest rate reductions this year bringing the total decrease to 150 basis points
2001-11-08;2001;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9912775754928589;the new level of interest rates is appropriate to maintain price stability over the medium term
2001-11-08;2001;November;REPORT;Positive;0.5849659442901611;this in turn will favour an environment conducive to restoring higher economic growth in the euro area
2001-11-08;2001;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9860742092132568;interest rates across the entire yield curve are now very low by all measures and liquidity conditions are supportive to economic growth
2001-11-08;2001;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.6640982627868652;at this juncture i should like to recall our position as regards the impact of slower economic growth on the euro area countries fiscal positions
2001-11-08;2001;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.5884100794792175;while it is natural for an economic slowdown to have adverse effects on member states budgets it is important that especially those countries with a budget position still not close to balance or in surplus andor with high public debttogdp ratios adhere to their mediumterm consolidation plans
2001-11-08;2001;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.6206071972846985;the current slowdown should not substantially change the scope for reaching the mediumterm commitments they made under the stability and growth pact and in the context of their stability programmes
2001-11-08;2001;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9833620190620422;let me again emphasise that a mediumterm perspective and continuous consolidation are essential for the conduct of fiscal policy in all euro area countries
2001-11-08;2001;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9859020709991455;this would give a firm signal to investors and consumers thereby supporting confidence and contributing to a recovery
2001-11-08;2001;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9831652641296387;in their efforts to further expand the production potential of the euro area governments should also give greater impetus to the implementation of structural reforms
2001-11-08;2001;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9831647872924805;fiscal reforms including those related to pension systems as well as to the level and composition of public revenue and expenditure would provide the correct incentives
2001-11-08;2001;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9868541955947876;labour and product market reforms will be beneficial to employment growth in the euro area and will improve the resilience of the euro area economy to adverse shocks in the future
2001-11-08;2001;November;REPORT;Positive;0.5781878232955933;while it may be perceived as more difficult to advance in these areas in an environment of weaker economic activity the need to properly address rigidities should be much more obvious now than at times of buoyant growth
2001-11-08;2001;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9782968759536743;the current weakness should therefore be taken as a challenge to be met by stepping up reforms rather than allowing efforts to abate
2001-11-08;2001;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9888301491737366;finally i would like to inform you that the governing council has decided that as from today it will  as a rule  assess the stance of the ecbs monetary policy only at its first meeting of the month
2001-11-08;2001;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9929392337799072;accordingly interest rate decisions will normally be taken during that meeting
2001-11-08;2001;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9777177572250366;at the second meeting of the month the governing council will deal for the most part with issues related to other tasks and responsibilities of the ecb and the eurosystem
2001-11-08;2001;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9815343618392944;after the second meeting of the month a press release on the ecbs monetary policy decisions will no longer be issued
2001-11-08;2001;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9585675001144409;obviously if warranted by the circumstances the governing council can still decide to change the key ecb interest rates at any time regardless of previously scheduled meetings as was recently demonstrated by the decision to lower interest rates on 17 september 2001
