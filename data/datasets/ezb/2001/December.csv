2001-12-06;2001;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9863881468772888;the governing council conducted a comprehensive examination of recent monetary and economic developments in order to assess the prospects for the maintenance of price stability in the euro area over the medium term
2001-12-06;2001;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.975013792514801;it concluded that the information which has become available since the governing council meeting of 8 november confirmed our expectations and thereby also the forwardlooking decisions taken over the past few months by the governing council
2001-12-06;2001;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9851903319358826;against this background the governing council decided to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged
2001-12-06;2001;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9886837601661682;the governing council continues to consider the current level of key ecb interest rates appropriate
2001-12-06;2001;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.8365973234176636;starting with the analysis under the first pillar of our monetary policy strategy the threemonth average of the annual growth rates of m3 rose to 68 in the period from august to october 2001 this was significantly above the mediumterm reference value for annual m3 growth of 4 ½
2001-12-06;2001;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9687022566795349;we confirmed this value of 4 ½ today in our annual review of the reference value
2001-12-06;2001;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.5859993696212769;this decision was taken on the grounds that the evidence continues to support the mediumterm assumptions underlying the derivation of the reference value namely those for trend potential output growth of 22 ½ per annum and for a trend decline in m3 income velocity of ½1 per annum in the euro area
2001-12-06;2001;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9734036922454834;we will issue a separate press release today providing further background to the confirmation of the reference value
2001-12-06;2001;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9854272603988647;in comparing current developments with the reference value we have to keep in mind that the reference value is a mediumterm concept
2001-12-06;2001;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9824413657188416;shortrun movements of m3 may stem from a number of temporary factors and do not necessarily have implications for future price developments
2001-12-06;2001;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.984298586845398;for this reason the governing council made it clear already in 1998 that the announcement of the reference value does not entail a commitment on the part of the ecb to correct mechanistically deviations of monetary growth from the reference value
2001-12-06;2001;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9901893734931946;rather developments of m3 are thoroughly analysed by the ecb in conjunction with other monetary indicators and information from the second pillar in order to ascertain their implications for the risks to price stability over the medium term
2001-12-06;2001;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9874891638755798;the recent strong m3 growth confirmed our previous assessment that in the phase of relatively high financial market uncertainty after the terrorist attacks on the united states investors have shifted their portfolios towards liquid and relatively safe shortterm assets included in m3
2001-12-06;2001;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9525752067565918;such shifts should be temporary and should not be seen as indicating future inflationary pressures
2001-12-06;2001;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9396715760231018;this assessment of current monetary developments is also underpinned by the fact that credit growth to the private sector has been continuously falling over recent months
2001-12-06;2001;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9545132517814636;however we will need to continue analysing developments in m3 closely
2001-12-06;2001;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9133254885673523;should the current economic and financial market uncertainties subside any persisting excess liquidity in the economy should be carefully reassessed with respect to whether it signals risks to price stability
2001-12-06;2001;December;REPORT;Negative;0.9919666051864624;regarding the second pillar recent information confirmed our earlier assessment that economic activity in the euro area has been weak in the second half of 2001 and will probably remain so in early 2002 this reflects the lower export demand resulting from the current slowdown in global economic activity and the fact that consumption and investment decisions in the euro area are being adversely affected by the current climate of economic uncertainty
2001-12-06;2001;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.6336280703544617;however the conditions are there for economic growth to improve in the course of 2002 there are no major imbalances in the euro area which would require a lengthy correction process
2001-12-06;2001;December;REPORT;Negative;0.9244288802146912;at the same time financing conditions are very favourable in the euro area
2001-12-06;2001;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9917802214622498;furthermore the recent fall in oil prices and more generally the expected further decline in consumer price inflation will lead to higher growth in real disposable income and should thereby support domestic demand
2001-12-06;2001;December;REPORT;Positive;0.988805890083313;developments in financial markets over the past few weeks signal a more optimistic assessment by market participants of the economic growth prospects in the euro area
2001-12-06;2001;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9675213098526001;all available forecasts indicate an improvement of the euro area economy in the course of next year
2001-12-06;2001;December;REPORT;Negative;0.8831633925437927;in the current economic environment we should not expect mediumterm upward pressures on inflation
2001-12-06;2001;December;REPORT;Negative;0.5162904858589172;the need to sustain employment growth in an environment of price stability will call for a continuation of the process of wage moderation
2001-12-06;2001;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.5541213154792786;in the coming months movements in annual inflation rates may be somewhat erratic on account of base effects relating to the relatively volatile pattern of price increases in late 2000 and early 2001 however annual inflation rates are clearly on a downward trend and barring any unforeseen volatility in components of the hicp they should fall to safely below 2 next year
2001-12-06;2001;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9832788109779358;at the current juncture it is important that fiscal policies maintain a mediumterm orientation in order to support the credibility of the stability and growth pact thereby strengthening the confidence of consumers and investors
2001-12-06;2001;December;REPORT;Negative;0.993013322353363;government budget balances in 2001 are on average for the euro area as a whole expected to worsen for the first time since 1993 owing to the macroeconomic slowdown and the lack of expenditure restraint in countries which implemented significant tax cuts
2001-12-06;2001;December;REPORT;Negative;0.9911063313484192;the current slowdown presents a particular challenge for countries which have not yet attained budgetary positions close to balance or in surplus or which have high public debttogdp ratios
2001-12-06;2001;December;REPORT;Negative;0.5352410078048706;countries without structural fiscal imbalances can contribute to macroeconomic stability by letting automatic stabilisers fully operate
2001-12-06;2001;December;REPORT;Negative;0.9730921387672424;however there is no case for fiscal activism as this has often proven ineffective in the past and risks reintroducing imbalances
2001-12-06;2001;December;REPORT;Positive;0.7112433314323425;a key remaining challenge for the euro area is to strengthen the productive forces in the economy by providing the proper incentives for economic agents
2001-12-06;2001;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.8656612634658813;the governing council believes that the potential upward impact on trend output growth from structural reforms and technological innovation could be large
2001-12-06;2001;December;REPORT;Positive;0.8355695009231567;however while some progress has been made in the field of structural reform significant further steps  especially in the labour and goods markets  need to be taken in order to achieve a permanent and significant increase in potential output growth in the euro area
2001-12-06;2001;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.5736480951309204;furthermore in the fiscal area governments should pursue determined structural expenditure reforms in order to create room for further tax cuts and for absorbing the fiscal costs associated with the ageing of populations
2001-12-06;2001;December;REPORT;Positive;0.7853543162345886;such reforms would enhance the effectiveness of the fiscal environment in supporting employment investment and economic dynamism
2001-12-06;2001;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.8934231996536255;finally let me say a few words on the forthcoming cash changeover
2001-12-06;2001;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9678958058357239;first of all owing to the careful preparations by both the eurosystem and the other parties involved in the logistics the changeover is well on track
2001-12-06;2001;December;REPORT;Positive;0.8898982405662537;i gratefully acknowledge the efforts of all the staff of the eurosystem as well as of banks retailers cashintransit companies the vending machine industry and all others who are working hard to make this changeover a success
2001-12-06;2001;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9868435263633728;in economic terms we expect the cash changeover to have no noticeable direct effects on the average price level in the euro area
2001-12-06;2001;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9821587204933167;this is largely due to the vigilance of consumers and the strong competition in the retail sector but also reflects the commitment of governments not to increase the average level of administered prices in the context of the cash changeover
2001-12-06;2001;December;REPORT;Negative;0.9820470809936523;in addition the effects of the cash changeover on m3 growth should remain very limited
2001-12-06;2001;December;REPORT;Negative;0.6169307231903076;although we have seen a significant decline in currency in circulation over recent months currency only represents a small fraction of m3 and a large part of its decline has been reflected in higher holdings of shortterm deposits with banks
2001-12-06;2001;December;REPORT;Positive;0.7503944635391235;as regards liquidity in the euro area money market the eurosystems operational framework will facilitate a successful cash changeover as it ensures maximum flexibility in the implementation of monetary policy
2001-12-06;2001;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9867221117019653;lastly the model chosen by the eurosystem to debit the banks for the frontloaded euro cash will help to smooth this process the banks will not be debited on one single date but rather onethird at a time on the settlement dates of the main refinancing operations on 2 23 and 30 january
2001-12-06;2001;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9779096841812134;to conclude we expect this event to run smoothly and look forward to a good start to the relationship between european citizens and their new currency
