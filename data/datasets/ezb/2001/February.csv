2001-02-01;2001;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8389931321144104;this assessment may also have been reinforced by the recent moderation in oil prices and the movement of the euro exchange rate in the period since the end of october 2000 lower oil prices and the appreciation of the euro have already produced some effects on price developments

2001-02-01;2001;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9910522103309631;over the near term this process may be slowed down by the delayed impact of past import price increases and possibly also by some transitory further food price rises caused by the current health issues associated with beef consumption
2001-02-01;2001;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8483352065086365;it may therefore take some time for hicp inflation to move back below 2
2001-02-01;2001;February;REPORT;Negative;0.8619221448898315;notwithstanding the assessment that the risks to price stability are now more balanced there are still factors posing upside risks which therefore require continued attention
