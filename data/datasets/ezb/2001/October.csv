2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9258893132209778;introductory statement willem f duisenberg president of the european central bank christian noyer vicepresident of the european central bank vienna 11 october 2001 with a transcript of the questions and answers ladies and gentlemen the governing council of the european central bank met today for the fourth time outside frankfurt
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.7991234064102173;let me first of all thank our host governor liebscher and the staff of the oesterreichische nationalbank for the invitation to vienna and for the generous hospitality offered to us
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9873923659324646;as usual the governing council conducted its examination of monetary and economic developments and analysis of their implications for the maintenance of price stability in the euro area
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9910422563552856;based on its assessment under both the first and second pillar the governing council decided to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.581505298614502;the level of the key ecb interest rates at the current juncture is therefore seen as consistent with maintaining price stability over the medium term
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9867721199989319;given the high level of uncertainty in the international environment we will continue to monitor developments very closely and thoroughly and we will assess new information in the context of our mediumtermoriented monetary policy strategy aimed at delivering price stability in the euro area
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9861745834350586;let me elaborate somewhat on the assessment provided under the two pillars of the monetary policy strategy of the ecb
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9902172088623047;looking at the first pillar we have seen a strong increase in m3 growth over the past few months
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9760872721672058;however a number of temporary factors play an important role in explaining recent monetary developments
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.6099628210067749;notably the uncertainty in stock markets and the relatively flat yield curve until august have led to portfolio shifts by private investors from longerterm assets to shortterm assets included in m3
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9940921664237976;furthermore the growth of credit to the private sector continued to slow down in august
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Negative;0.8743603825569153;for these reasons we do not judge that monetary developments signal risks to price stability at this juncture
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9743932485580444;this notwithstanding the developments of m3 will have to be monitored carefully in the coming months
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Negative;0.97468501329422;as regards the second pillar the assessment is currently surrounded by a particularly high degree of uncertainty
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9902717471122742;this concerns in particular the international environment
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9895888566970825;last months terrorist attacks had a negative impact on economic activity and confidence which could delay the resumption of higher economic growth
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8389075994491577;against this background it was important that policymakers in the united states the euro area and in other countries around the world acted with measures to support confidence
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9918654561042786;a further positive feature is the recent fall in oil prices which should be helpful in containing inflationary pressure and supporting the real disposable income of households thereby sustaining consumption in many countries
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Negative;0.49645447731018066;with regard to economic growth in the euro area it would be premature to offer a firm assessment of the macroeconomic impact of the tragic events in the united states and current activities to combat global terrorism
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9885671138763428;at present there are no major imbalances in the euro area which would require a longerterm adjustment process
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9895915389060974;on account of policies aimed at price stability fiscal consolidation wage moderation and structural reform the euro area fundamentals remain very positive
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9842635989189148;financing conditions are favourable and inflation is declining
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Negative;0.973800778388977;the mere existence of the euro has sheltered the countries of the euro area from adverse intraeuropean exchange rate tensions which had typically plagued many countries when external shocks occurred in the past
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9892827272415161;taken together all these elements should provide a much better base than in the past for a recovery in the course of next year once the initial shock has been absorbed
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.6676141619682312;however notwithstanding all these positive aspects we will continue to monitor downside risks to the current situation
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Positive;0.933954119682312;against this background we are confident that inflation in the euro area will continue to decline to a level consistent with price stability
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Negative;0.6587244272232056;receding external price pressures combined with the expected continuation of wage moderation underpin this expectation
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9751649498939514;for the time being we thus see a confirmation of our earlier assessment which led us to reduce the key ecb interest rates by 50 basis points on 17 september
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Negative;0.5105197429656982;in fact the recent events strengthened tendencies towards lower rates of inflation that were already prevailing before
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9754303097724915;given their nature and their expected economic consequences the terrorist attacks clearly warranted a prompt flexible and appropriate response by the governing council in the context of the mediumtermoriented monetary policy strategy of the ecb
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Negative;0.6269953846931458;regarding fiscal policies there have been very encouraging signs of firm fiscal consolidation in a significant number of euro area member states over past years whereas in a few other countries progress towards balanced fiscal positions has been slower
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9648339748382568;it is natural for an economic slowdown to have adverse effects on member countries budget positions and there is no need for immediate countervailing actions
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.7497780919075012;however a shortlived slowdown should not drastically change the scope for reaching the targets set in the countries stability programmes
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9844322204589844;for countries with a budget position still not close to balance or in surplus it is important to adhere to their mediumterm consolidation plans
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Positive;0.45938631892204285;turning to the longterm prospects in order to raise the rate of potential economic growth in the euro area structural reforms in the size and composition of public revenue and expenditure as well as in product and labour markets have to continue
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Positive;0.967420756816864;advances have been made in times of high real gdp growth although in many areas including in labour markets more could have been achieved
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9616578817367554;as adjustment needs are likely to become more visible in periods of less vigorous economic growth policymakers must now intensify the acceleration of reforms rather than allow efforts to abate
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9857800602912903;moving forward the reform agenda decisively will enable the euro area economy to respond flexibly in future and thereby underpin our confidence that external shocks can be more easily absorbed than in the past
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9033815860748291;transcript of the questions asked and the answers given by dr willem f duisenberg president of the ecb christian noyer vicepresident of the european central bank and klaus liebscher governor of the oesterreichische nationalbank question mr duisenberg what can european policy makers actually do to help the european economy
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Negative;0.8818174004554749;governments cannot really stand more it seems because of the stability pact and as your action showed today the ecb does not feel like it is in a position to cut interest rates
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9249873161315918;the other question i have is on 17 september the ecb was praised for quick action and i would like to know what you say to critics who will now probably point to the fact that since 17 september the bank of england and the fed have moved again but the ecb has not
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.5112888813018799;duisenberg as to the first question i think governments have responded and i think it is exaggerated also to say that governments cannot respond
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9923511147499084;as i said in my introductory statement we fully accept that it is natural that adverse economic development or slower economic growth will not fail to have an impact on budgetary positions
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9556841850280762;and then you expect the automatic stabilisers to take care of that
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Positive;0.5286211967468262;well that can be done but it is crucial that the structural budgetary policies remain in place and remain geared to achieving over the medium term the goals set by the countries themselves in their stabilisation programmes in accordance with the stability and growth pact
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9544411301612854;but in as far as budgetary positions develop actually for purely cyclical reasons to develop or to produce results which lead to deficits which are somewhat higher than is in conformity with the mediumterm goals that is acceptable
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9216437935829163;but it is true that those countries which have already used the periods of high economic growth to achieve the intended position of having their budget in balance or surplus have more room to let the automatic stabilisers work than those countries which have failed to reach those targets in an adequate tempo let me call it that
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9351149797439575;as far as the 17 september decision is concerned let me first point out that that decision to lower rates by 50 basis points in concert with the federal reserve system on 17 september came only about two weeks after we had already lowered rates by 25 basis points
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9219744801521301;in all we have lowered rates by 100 basis points over the recent period and it is now thought that barring new events or new information we have reached a monetary policy stance which is consistent with maintaining price stability over the medium term
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9411647319793701;in addition i would like to say that the most crucial challenge that faces the authorities all authorities over the near future is to restore confidence amongst consumers and investors in their future
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Negative;0.6268866062164307;and the big question to answer is what contribution monetary policy can deliver to restore that confidence
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9631022214889526;and in our opinion a move so soon after the previous move which was a clear prompt and appropriate reaction to the terrible events that had happened would fail to do the trick of restoring confidence at short notice
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9851356148719788;we believe that creating an environment of stable prices through a stabilityoriented monetary policy in a forwardlooking manner is the best contribution we can make not only to the growth of output and employment but also to the restoration of confidence within the public at large
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.661750853061676;question mr duisenberg
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Negative;0.7414492964744568;there was a lot of speculation of course prior to this meeting that you might cut interest rates
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9812946319580078;speculation is sure to increase with each successive meeting in which you do not move
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9334793090820312;it would also appear that based on your assessment that inflationary risks are going to recede over the coming time shortterm rates may come down further
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.6643082499504089;a question of timing perhaps
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Negative;0.6473500728607178;you said today that it is premature to give an assessment of the impact of the terrorist attacks on the euro zone economy
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9348059296607971;my question is what data will you be looking at specifically for the euro zone in order to gain a better assessment
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.871584415435791;what are the key data that you are now going to look at
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9882547855377197;duisenberg it is the whole range of data which will be coming in in the course of the next few months on the development of prices output and employment of the balance of payments ie
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9669742584228516;the whole range of data which we usually look at
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9587306976318359;and they will lead us to reassess the prospects for reaching price stability currently those prospects are fairly benign
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9328159689903259;i have to remind you that we expect to reach a situation of price stability early next year
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9639151096343994;so that on average we expect inflation next year to be at the satisfactory average level of just below 2
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.5982423424720764;with that we are satisfied
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Negative;0.7083837389945984;question mr duisenberg apart from the insecure political situation at the moment you sound rather optimistic with regard to economic growth next year
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8901069164276123;i would like to know if this optimism was shared by everybody at this meeting in vienna
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9483670592308044;duisenberg what i just read out to you was the considered opinion of the governing council
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9484953880310059;so you can assume that the relative optimism was shared but then one side remark we do believe that growth which has clearly slowed down in the course of this year and will continue to be very slow for the remainder of this year will resume in the course of next year and maybe already in the early part of next year
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9556437134742737;but resumption of growth is not the same as enjoying high growth though it will be relatively modest
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.3562304377555847;but under the conditions that we deliver namely price stability
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Negative;0.5993648171424866;question mr duisenberg what do you say to criticism that the ecb is a central bank that is behind the curve so to say and too slow to respond to a worldwide crisis to which other central banks have reacted a bit more promptly and that todays decision not to lower interest rates was influenced very much by tactical considerations having to do with the circumstances under which the last decision was taken and an attempt by the ecb to demonstrate that it will not allow itself to be pressured into taking interest rate decisions as could be seen by the bidding at the last refinancing tender
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Negative;0.8819352388381958;duisenberg well the decision taken on 17 september 2001 certainly does not bear witness to your claim that we are slow in reacting and resistant to change
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9843239784240723;i thought it was a very prompt and appropriate decision taken on 17 september 2001 to be seen to take effectively what was maybe an exceptional decision in exceptional circumstances in bringing forward a rate cut that we had already contemplated before applying it earlier than had been foreseen and making it larger  within a matter of two hours i might say  and also earlier than anticipated this in response to the assessment that the horrible events in the united states might have a negative impact on economic growth and thereby also cause the inflation rate to come down more strongly and sooner than earlier anticipated
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9172398447990417;question translation mr duisenberg was this nondecision meant to avoid giving the impression that there is a crisis
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Negative;0.5770314335823059;you were talking a lot about the confidence of investors and consumers which you want to regain
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Positive;0.7368847727775574;as i say maybe 25 points would have helped confidence more than not doing anything
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.608981728553772;duisenberg well i would take issue with the expression not doing anything
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Positive;0.8788431286811829;dont forget but it seems that everybody has forgotten that we lowered interest rates on 30 august 2001 and then again on 17 september 2001 and we do believe that with that level we have for the time being barring new information on events yet to happen new information to come in that we have reached a level of interest rates which is consistent in the context of our monetary policy strategy with our declared aim of preserving price stability
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.5656789541244507;and i think we have explained that strategy and that aim so thoroughly to the european public and the world that reacting to very shortterm be it tragic events in a continuously panicky way would to my mind do more to undermine confidence than to strengthen it
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.6982946395874023;question translation mr solbes the european commissioner for economic and monetary affairs said in an interview on tuesday that the euro area was already on the verge of recession
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9640774130821228;he took part in discussions
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.879453718662262;can you tell me how they went on this point
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8758889436721802;do you share this fear
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.7895475625991821;my second question is on the money supply m3
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.985271692276001;a large increase in m3 has been recorded on account of money being parked in shortterm liquid assets instead of being invested in stock markets
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8191820979118347;if this parking of money lasts for a long time is there not an inflationary risk from this part of m3 because that money might then be used for consumption since longterm investment opportunities are uncertain
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9745965600013733;duisenberg we do not have the feeling that europe is in or on the verge of a recession
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Negative;0.7911470532417297;growth is slow admittedly slower than we had anticipated earlier but of a recession we do not speak
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Negative;0.6537416577339172;witness although this refers to only one part of the european union the figures published for france for example yesterday which point to an average annual growth rate of gdp of 20 in 2001 we do not regard that as a recession
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9792248606681824;neither do we regard quarteronquarter developments in the euro area as a whole as pointing to a recession
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.6008486747741699;now we believe that the fact that investors have temporarily shifted their portfolio investment into more liquid assets which are part of m3 is a temporary phenomenon  while your question implies that it will be a longterm phenomenon  and that people would rather spend on consumer goods i suppose than start investing in portfolio assets anew
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.944889485836029;we believe that this is the most likely event and therefore we do not consider this course of the growth rate of m3 as a source of future inflationary pressures
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8504458069801331;question translation president duisenberg you pointed out how large the responsibility of fiscal policymakers is
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8696610927581787;in this light how do you view the decision by the german federal government to increase taxes
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Negative;0.897036612033844;i would say that this is psychologically not a good decision
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9350667595863342;it reduces purchasing power increases inflation and makes wage negotiations difficult
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Negative;0.7328736186027527;do you not think that the ecb president should offer a word of criticism here
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9742932319641113;duisenberg if i were to offer a word of criticism i would do it directly to the authorities in question
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9720355868339539;but i do not comment or take questions on developments in individual euro area countries
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9490829110145569;question in recent days we have heard the finance ministers of belgium and france amongst others make the suggestion that because they are showing responsibility in fiscal policy this offers and i quote room for manoeuvre on the monetary policy side
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.6759122014045715;do you think that the ecb does have room for manoeuvre
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Negative;0.7650279402732849;duisenberg if we do have room for manoeuvre there is very little
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9330782890319824;and events are still rapidly developing and we have to be very careful in using any room which there might be
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.7942985892295837;so you might say that in view of the very high uncertainties confronting us also in the immediate future we prefer to keep our powder dry
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.7205667495727539;question i have two questions
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9592190980911255;the first is what is your view of moves by a number of european governments to help their national airlines with loans or loan guarantees
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.7745683193206787;and the second question is in view of the very high uncertainty you were talking about do you think it would be unwise to have a change of leadership at the european central bank during the next twelve months
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.970723032951355;duisenberg concerning the aid to national airlines i would suggest that you direct that question at the european commission
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8926153182983398;and to change the leadership of the european central bank in the next twelve months i think would be an unwise decision
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9673762321472168;question mr president you mentioned that the european central bank had already considered a rate cut before the attacks but you were very careful not to send any signals that would indicate socalled bias ie
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.968451976776123;a rate bias when you were addressing your audience before
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.950070858001709;the question is given the current situation are you prepared to give us any kind of lead on where  if at all  you would move in which direction the next move would be
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.836667001247406;duisenberg no i am not prepared to do so at this stage
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9825208783149719;i explained that the decision we took today is a forwardlooking decision based on all the information we have available to us over the medium term
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9330708980560303;and that is about it
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.6382404565811157;question translation mr president you were saying that because of the events on 11 september you took your decision a little earlier than you thought you would have to
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.7408624887466431;could you tell us what you had thought earlier on
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8895736336708069;would you maybe not have taken that decision if the events of that day had not occurred
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9366617798805237;and as for the future would you say that similar events could also lead you to maybe speed up your decisions in future as well
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.6734610795974731;and could you also comment on the possible leeway that you might have as far as concertation with american monetary authorities is concerned
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8767781853675842;are you willing to go for more concerted measures with the fed and monetary authorities there
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.7958953976631165;duisenberg this is a hypothetical question
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9765644073486328;however had we not taken that decision on 17 september i regard it as highly likely that we would have taken the decision be it on a smaller scale about ten days later at the regular meeting of the governing council
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9450016617774963;but as i said before these were exceptional decisions in exceptional circumstances but still totally in line with our mediumtermoriented monetary policy strategy
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9519845247268677;now the question becomes even more hypothetical if the events were to repeat themselves which of course nobody hopes would you take similar take action
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9655796885490417;we would naturally be in close contact  as we have been over the past weeks and both before and after 11 september  with our colleagues on the other side of the atlantic
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9735127091407776;and we will continue to do so and we will decide what to do as developments occur and as events materialise
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9032976031303406;question mr duisenberg we are living in exceptional times
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Negative;0.6835145950317383;11 september was perhaps an exceptional oneoff perhaps not
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8640857934951782;god forbid that we see that kind of exception again
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8677193522453308;but have you built into your strategy some kind of flexibility to move rates again in the event of another exceptional oneoff that would not tip your mediumterm price stability strategy on its head
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9770968556404114;duisenberg i can literally say that we will cross that bridge when we get to it
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.5087341070175171;and i hope that we will never get to that bridge
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8526002764701843;question mr duisenberg i would like to come back to the question of confidence
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9939104318618774;confidence in europe has dropped considerably since 11 september
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8170485496520996;how can you explain the fact that  as you said  by not reducing interest rates you are going to increase confidence
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8331716656684875;duisenberg i did not say that but i said that it is doubtful whether a range of rate changes coming quickly one after the other would by themselves enhance confidence rather than maybe even undermine confidence
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9586946368217468;the public has to have confidence in its central bank in its pursuit of price stability over the medium term in applying its declared strategy and delivering what it has promised to the public to deliver namely price stability
2001-10-11;2001;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9629572033882141;and i do think following that strategy  and if the public recognises that we do what we say and we deliver what we promise  is the best contribution that we can make to restoring confidence among consumers and investors
