2001-05-10;2001;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.937070906162262;this reduction is to be seen as an adjustment of the level of interest rates to somewhat lower inflationary pressure over the medium term
2001-05-10;2001;May;REPORT;Positive;0.975487232208252;on the basis of the information available this is the appropriate level of interest rates to ensure that the euro area economy will be able to maintain price stability and thereby to contribute to sound economic growth over the coming years

2001-05-10;2001;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9599323868751526;m3 growth has been on a gradual downward trend since spring 2000 reflecting the increase in the key ecb interest rates which occurred in the period from november 1999 the threemonth average of the annual growth rates of m3 was 48 in the period from january to march 2001 which is close to the reference value of 4 12
2001-05-10;2001;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9945106506347656;in the past few months some slowdown in credit aggregates has also been visible
2001-05-10;2001;May;REPORT;Negative;0.5860138535499573;in addition as already stated on several occasions there have been indications that the monetary growth figures are distorted upwards by noneuro area residents purchases of negotiable paper included in m3
2001-05-10;2001;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9494196772575378;this has now been confirmed by clear evidence and the magnitudes involved are significant
2001-05-10;2001;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.5502243638038635;as regards holdings of money market fund unitsshares by noneuro area residents on which we now have solid statistical data the distortion has become more sizeable over recent months and currently amounts to around half a percentage point
2001-05-10;2001;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9808423519134521;in addition there have been nonnegligible upward distortions to the annual growth of m3 as a result of noneuro area residents holdings of other marketable paper included in m3 for which precise statistical information is currently being developed
2001-05-10;2001;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9740884304046631;the ecb will keep the public informed about ongoing developments in these categories of m3
2001-05-10;2001;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9806683659553528;as these factors can be broadly identified the information content under the first pillar is ensured
2001-05-10;2001;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9730739593505859;taking into account these upward distortions as well as all information from the first pillar it can now be concluded that there is no longer a risk to price stability over the medium term emanating from the first pillar
2001-05-10;2001;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9945201277732849;as regards the second pillar upward risks to price stability over the medium term have diminished somewhat
2001-05-10;2001;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9734827280044556;this view is supported by all forecasts
2001-05-10;2001;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9751268625259399;the evidence available however requires continued monitoring of growth trends and wage developments in particular
2001-05-10;2001;May;REPORT;Negative;0.990041196346283;first owing to the less favourable external environment a moderation in real gdp growth in the euro area will contain upward pressure on consumer prices arising from the demand side
2001-05-10;2001;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9228636026382446;notwithstanding the high uncertainty surrounding the outlook for external developments forecasts suggest that actual economic growth will nevertheless be broadly in line with trend potential growth supported by domestic demand
2001-05-10;2001;May;REPORT;Negative;0.8940747380256653;second wage moderation has so far been maintained for the euro area as a whole despite the effect of the oil price shock
2001-05-10;2001;May;REPORT;Positive;0.8769490718841553;this has been a very positive factor and lends support to those forecasts which assume that current inflation rates will not spill over into future wage negotiations
2001-05-10;2001;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9571563005447388;this notwithstanding wage developments need to be continuously monitored
2001-05-10;2001;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.6407745480537415;an abatement of domestic cost pressures on hicp inflation remains conditional on the continuation of wage moderation
2001-05-10;2001;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9608511328697205;for the governing council it is of utmost importance that wage negotiators should have full confidence in monetary policy maintaining price stability in the euro area over the medium term
2001-05-10;2001;May;REPORT;Negative;0.988675594329834;for some months to come this mediumterm trend will be overshadowed by temporary developments in unprocessed food prices following the health concerns related to meat consumption and the consequences of the outbreak of footandmouth disease
2001-05-10;2001;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.7996665835380554;moreover the passthrough of the indirect effects of past rises in oil prices and the past depreciation of the euro is likely to continue for some months
2001-05-10;2001;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.961300253868103;the effects of these extraordinary factors should however gradually diminish over the course of this year implying an improved outlook for inflation to fall below 2 in 2002 the governing council has to focus on the outlook for price stability in the medium term as only this perspective allows for the time lags for monetary policy to work its way through the economy
2001-05-10;2001;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9771872162818909;the information under the first pillar indicates that price stability can be maintained over a mediumterm horizon

2001-05-10;2001;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9876648783683777;the picture from the two pillars taken together is positive
2001-05-10;2001;May;REPORT;Negative;0.8410274386405945;at the same time it underlines the need to remain vigilant
2001-05-10;2001;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9725510478019714;fiscal policy will have to continue the consolidation process in line with the stability and growth pact and the commitments made in the context of the stability programmes
2001-05-10;2001;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.6699463129043579;the avoidance of inflationary pressures on a permanent basis in an environment of solid growth requires that governments and social partners implement decisively the structural measures in labour and product markets that are essential for lifting the growth potential of the euro area

2001-05-10;2001;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9823006391525269;this volume is based on the estimated national requirements of the ncbs
2001-05-10;2001;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9910227060317993;as the future national needs for euro banknotes cannot be reliably determined on account of the potential impact of banknote migration between countries production from 2003 onwards will be allocated to the ncbs taking into account their launch stock requirements the capital key and the specific situation of banknote demand in some countries
