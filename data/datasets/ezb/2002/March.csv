2002-03-07;2002;March;REPORT;Positive;0.976646363735199;first of all we were pleased to see that the euro cash changeover went so smoothly  more smoothly in fact than we could have hoped
2002-03-07;2002;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9232709407806396;the european public very quickly became familiar with the new banknotes and coins as is shown by the fact that national banknotes were largely withdrawn well before the final deadline of their ceasing to be legal tender

2002-03-07;2002;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9560009241104126;as usual at todays meeting we examined recent monetary financial and economic developments
2002-03-07;2002;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9873867630958557;the governing council concluded that the information which had become available in recent weeks confirmed that the current level of key ecb interest rates remains appropriate for the maintenance of price stability over the medium term

2002-03-07;2002;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.5542217493057251;starting with the analysis under the first pillar of our monetary policy strategy the threemonth average of the annual growth rates of m3 stood at 80 in the period from november 2001 to january 2002 compared with 78 in the period from october to december 2001 the high level of the annual growth rates of m3 is very much related to portfolio shifts to liquid positions most of which occurred in the autumn of 2001 in an economic and financial environment characterised by high uncertainty
2002-03-07;2002;March;REPORT;Negative;0.898780882358551;while many investors still seemed to be parking some of their assets in m3 in early 2002 some moderation in the shortterm dynamics of m3 could be observed around the turn of the year
2002-03-07;2002;March;REPORT;Negative;0.7997468113899231;the governing council continues to hold the view that the information from the first pillar thus far does not indicate risks to price stability as the portfolio reallocations which drove m3 growth in 2001 should remain temporary
2002-03-07;2002;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9938767552375793;in addition the slowdown in the rate of growth of loans to the private sector has been continuing over the past few months
2002-03-07;2002;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9838040471076965;however we will need to analyse monetary developments closely in the coming months
2002-03-07;2002;March;REPORT;Negative;0.8581553101539612;as regards the second pillar there are further signs that the trough in economic activity may have been reached at the end of last year

2002-03-07;2002;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.988252580165863;a similar picture is reflected in financial market expectations especially those embedded in bond yields
2002-03-07;2002;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9277104139328003;the economic fundamentals of the euro area are sound and there are no major imbalances that would require a lengthy process of adjustment
2002-03-07;2002;March;REPORT;Positive;0.992271900177002;the expectation of a recovery in the euro area in 2002 is furthermore supported by favourable financing conditions and by real disposable income benefiting from past and expected future declines in inflation
2002-03-07;2002;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9923966526985168;there is also increasing confirmation that economic activity outside the euro area is picking up which should lead to a gradual strengthening of the external demand for euro area products and services
2002-03-07;2002;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9892764091491699;while the strength of the recovery remains uncertain there are good reasons to expect a return of economic growth to levels in line with potential towards the end of the year
2002-03-07;2002;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9322377443313599;turning to shortterm price developments annual consumer price inflation picked up substantially in january
2002-03-07;2002;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.932356059551239;part of this increase was expected as it related to base effects stemming from falling energy prices in early 2001 and to higher indirect taxes in some euro area countries
2002-03-07;2002;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9763853549957275;furthermore the increase reflected a considerable rise in unprocessed food prices due to adverse weather conditions in parts of europe
2002-03-07;2002;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.939468264579773;part of the latter effect seems to have been reversed in the meantime as preliminary data for february indicate
2002-03-07;2002;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9734982252120972;some increases have also been observed in oil prices and in the rate of growth of services prices in january
2002-03-07;2002;March;REPORT;Negative;0.5924132466316223;while there might have been an impact on specific service categories in january overall there is no evidence that the euro cash changeover has had a significant upward effect on the average price level in the euro area or that the declining trend in annual inflation rates has been affected recently
2002-03-07;2002;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9198217391967773;in the coming months the effects of past increases in energy and food prices should gradually subside and annual inflation rates should fall to below 2
2002-03-07;2002;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9204413294792175;the recent behaviour of producer prices also points in this direction
2002-03-07;2002;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9275604486465454;beyond that horizon we expect little upward pressure on prices from aggregate demand and barring unforeseen developments inflation rates to be in line with price stability
2002-03-07;2002;March;REPORT;Negative;0.6139881610870361;however the current favourable outlook for inflation fundamentally rests on the assumption of a continuation of wage moderation
2002-03-07;2002;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9902883768081665;as i already noted last month there is some cause for concern with regard to ongoing wage negotiations
2002-03-07;2002;March;REPORT;Positive;0.7922052145004272;a continuation of wage moderation in the euro area is crucial not only to foster employment growth but also to support monetary policy in its task to maintain price stability

2002-03-07;2002;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9750425815582275;the governing council supports the actions taken by the european commission in the context of the stability and growth pact and the subsequent outcome of the ecofin council meeting last month
2002-03-07;2002;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.921731173992157;it is now necessary to remain vigilant in order to ensure strict adherence to the mediumterm plans and rigorous implementation of the procedures of the stability and growth pact
2002-03-07;2002;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9553675055503845;in order to further improve the fundamentals of the euro area and to put the expected recovery on a broad and sustainable basis euro area countries must strengthen their efforts to implement comprehensive structural reforms
2002-03-07;2002;March;REPORT;Positive;0.6869973540306091;over the past few years progress has been made with regard to enhancing the flexibility of euro area product and capital markets
2002-03-07;2002;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9876403212547302;euro area countries have also made some headway in terms of improving the way their labour markets operate
2002-03-07;2002;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9908320307731628;these reforms together with moderate wage developments have contributed to the strong employment growth and the considerable reduction in unemployment witnessed in many euro area countries in the last cyclical upswing
2002-03-07;2002;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9937385320663452;however it is worth noting that despite the continued high unemployment in the euro area firms continue to report difficulties in terms of recruiting suitably qualified workers
2002-03-07;2002;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9861724972724915;this suggests that further improvements in the functioning of euro area labour markets and their ability to match labour supply and demand are needed
2002-03-07;2002;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.6568462252616882;evidence gathered in a recent eurosystem analysis which will be published shortly supports this view
2002-03-07;2002;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9635427594184875;in this context i would also like to stress that structural reforms in different markets should not be seen in isolation
2002-03-07;2002;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9754080772399902;the more efficiently euro area product and capital markets function the greater the success of labour market reforms will be in creating employment opportunities
