2002-10-10;2002;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9895157814025879;on the one hand monetary trends have been influenced by considerable uncertainty in financial markets and therefore partly reflect strong liquidity preferences among investors
2002-10-10;2002;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.3950221538543701;on the other hand the low level of shortterm interest rates has tended to stimulate monetary expansion reflected particularly in the increase in the narrow aggregate m1

2002-10-10;2002;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9741708040237427;however given the current environment we do not see the risk of this translating into inflationary pressure in the near future
2002-10-10;2002;October;REPORT;Negative;0.99439537525177;concerning the second pillar the latest data and survey results confirm that economic activity in the euro area remains subdued
2002-10-10;2002;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9788517951965332;these data and results also suggest that real gdp growth in the third quarter of 2002 may turn out to be similar to that of the first two quarters when quarteronquarter expansion reached 04
2002-10-10;2002;October;REPORT;Negative;0.6160077452659607;against this background previous expectations of an acceleration in economic growth in 2002 will not materialise
2002-10-10;2002;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9944024682044983;at the same time a significant degree of uncertainty has been building up over recent months owing in particular to the sharp decline in stock prices and their potential detrimental effects on the economy as well as to geopolitical tensions as reflected in surging oil prices
2002-10-10;2002;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9495722055435181;nevertheless the main scenario for the euro area is a return in the course of 2003 to economic growth rates in line with those of potential as also reflected in forecasts by international organisations
2002-10-10;2002;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9930536150932312;however the uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook is high
2002-10-10;2002;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8252899646759033;sources of downside risks  including oil prices imbalances in the global economy financial market uncertainties and their impact on consumption investment and thus on employment  will be monitored closely
2002-10-10;2002;October;REPORT;Negative;0.5587462782859802;at this juncture it is particularly difficult to offer a precise assessment of the timing and strength of the economic upswing both in the euro area and globally

2002-10-10;2002;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9589114189147949;while no detailed information is as yet available for individual hicp subcomponents the recent increase is likely to reflect the rise in energy prices
2002-10-10;2002;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8576802015304565;these developments generally remain in line with previous expectations of inflation rates hovering at around 2 for the remainder of the year but shortterm trends could be affected by future oil price developments
2002-10-10;2002;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9865520596504211;looking further ahead the euro exchange rate which has strengthened since early this year and the overall economic environment should contribute towards reducing inflationary pressure
2002-10-10;2002;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9628192782402039;in addition we expect rates of perceived inflation which are currently high to move closer to actual rates
2002-10-10;2002;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9637719988822937;however the assessment that inflation rates will fall and remain below 2 depends on the development of oil prices and the prevalence of wage moderation
2002-10-10;2002;October;REPORT;Negative;0.5441004633903503;in this respect earlier this year we pointed to an upward trend in wage growth which according to preliminary indications may have come to a halt only recently
2002-10-10;2002;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9597861766815186;in the same vein we have noted the inertia of consumer price developments in the euro area as reflected in the stubbornness of the annual rate of inflation excluding unprocessed food and energy
2002-10-10;2002;October;REPORT;Negative;0.8118335604667664;this rate was 25 in august only marginally lower than early this year therefore vigilance is warranted

2002-10-10;2002;October;REPORT;Positive;0.8623573780059814;at the current juncture aggregate demand and exchange rate developments should contribute towards easing inflationary pressure while monetary developments wage trends and oil price developments could point to risks in the opposite direction

2002-10-10;2002;October;REPORT;Negative;0.988663375377655;regarding fiscal policies in the euro area the governing council notes with concern that there is still insufficient ambition in some countries to bring budgets to positions close to balance or in surplus over the medium term
2002-10-10;2002;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9914600849151611;the current fiscal problems in some countries arise from the fact that these countries did not take the opportunity to improve substantially on their fiscal positions when economic growth rates were considerably higher than is currently the case
2002-10-10;2002;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9822641015052795;given that this opportunity was missed there is now no alternative but for all countries with remaining imbalances to make firm commitments to avoid excessive deficits in keeping with the treaty provisions and to attain budgetary positions close to balance or in surplus as required under the stability and growth pact
2002-10-10;2002;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9842286109924316;swift decisive action is necessary in order to set up credible adjustment paths based both on realistic assumptions on the economic environment and on wellspecified consolidation measures
2002-10-10;2002;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9833312630653381;such adjustment paths must entail significant yearly improvements in the cyclically adjusted budget balance and must be followed strictly and be completed within the shortest possible timeframe
2002-10-10;2002;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9590925574302673;to underpin this process the ecb calls for strict monitoring procedures for the implementation of the consolidation strategies the full use of the excessive deficit procedure and the application of rigorous accounting rules

2002-10-10;2002;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9775438904762268;the attainment of budgetary positions in line with the stability and growth pact will gradually create scope for dealing with ageingrelated issues and their impact on public finances
2002-10-10;2002;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9654964804649353;in any case in the short term the pact does not place constraints on those member countries already in compliance although it does call for the transition to be completed in the few remaining countries
2002-10-10;2002;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.6949390769004822;direct effects on shortterm demand are to be counteracted by higher credibility of the conduct of fiscal policy  boosting confidence and thus private spending
2002-10-10;2002;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8799099326133728;we also urge governments to overcome the inertia in implementing structural reforms both within the area of fiscal expenditures and revenues and in labour and product markets
2002-10-10;2002;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9519561529159546;any further delay in tackling with greater determination the underlying reasons for limited growth in potential output over the medium term and for only partially exploiting the current potential is costly
2002-10-10;2002;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9621192216873169;it would also make it increasingly difficult to reach the objectives set in the lisbon agenda
2002-10-10;2002;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.946078896522522;structural reforms take time to unfold fully their benefits and should therefore be frontloaded
2002-10-10;2002;October;REPORT;Positive;0.5938338041305542;under the current circumstances frontloading is particularly needed as it would support confidence
