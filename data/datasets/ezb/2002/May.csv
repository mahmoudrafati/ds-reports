2002-05-02;2002;May;REPORT;Negative;0.978141725063324;the governing council comprehensively examined monetary financial and economic developments and also considered the accumulated changes in the economic outlook since its decision to lower the key ecb interest rates in november 2001 we concluded that the prospects for price stability appear to be somewhat less favourable than they were towards the end of last year
2002-05-02;2002;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9108107686042786;at the same time we recognised that the economic outlook remains subject to uncertainties and that price developments partly reflect the influence of specific temporary factors
2002-05-02;2002;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9852672815322876;accordingly we decided to leave the key ecb interest rates unchanged
2002-05-02;2002;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.917521595954895;starting with the analysis under the first pillar of our monetary policy strategy the threemonth average of the annual growth rates of m3 decreased to 75 in the period from january to march 2002 down from 78 in the period from december 2001 to february 2002 the high annual growth rate of m3 continues to reflect the portfolio shifts to liquid positions which occurred last autumn
2002-05-02;2002;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9947901964187622;in the meantime there has been some normalisation in the development of m3 as indicated by the slowdown in its shortterm dynamics in early 2002 the annual rate of growth of loans to the private sector also continued to decline in march
2002-05-02;2002;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9717127680778503;however m3 growth has only slowed relatively recently and for the time being the reversal of builtup liquidity is proceeding only slowly
2002-05-02;2002;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.8590700626373291;as regards the second pillar our expectations for a rebound in real gdp growth in the euro area have been confirmed by recently published forecasts of international organisations which all paint a similar picture
2002-05-02;2002;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9915519952774048;while the recovery in 2002 is expected to initially proceed at a gradual pace real gdp growth rates in the euro area should again be in line with potential growth later this year and solid growth rates should be attainable by 2003 business confidence has considerably improved in the euro area over the past few months and the conditions for a sustained upswing in domestic demand continue to be in place including favourable financing conditions
2002-05-02;2002;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9918878674507141;the more positive international environment should also help stimulate euro area exports thereby fuelling aggregate demand in the euro area
2002-05-02;2002;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9924452900886536;finally sound fundamentals and the absence of major imbalances support the positive outlook for the euro area economy
2002-05-02;2002;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9856886863708496;however there are still a number of uncertainties surrounding the strength of the current upswing such as those related to the future development of oil prices and to the impact of existing imbalances elsewhere on the world economy turning to price developments trends in inflation  with annual hicp increases of 27 in january falling to 22 in april according to eurostats early estimate  have been less satisfactory than expected a few months ago not least as a result of higher oil prices
2002-05-02;2002;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.8631060719490051;as stated on previous occasions price developments in both 2000 and 2001 and again in recent months have been shaped by a sequence of adverse but rather specific shocks to prices
2002-05-02;2002;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.8363882899284363;these should unwind sooner or later and in principle such shocks should not affect the mediumterm outlook for price stability
2002-05-02;2002;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9454167485237122;however it is essential that past upward tendencies in prices  even though they partly resulted from a clustering of specific factors  do not become entrenched
2002-05-02;2002;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9322969913482666;recently published forecasts of price developments in the euro area developments in indicators of inflation expectations and recent trends in wage settlements neither clearly confirm nor entirely contradict the risk of such entrenchment
2002-05-02;2002;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.8964824676513672;at this juncture it is therefore particularly important to remain vigilant with regard to the further evolution of the key factors determining the outlook for prices
2002-05-02;2002;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9238417744636536;on the basis of current information it is still possible that annual hicp inflation rates will fall below 2 in the coming months
2002-05-02;2002;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.8878366947174072;however the outcome is highly dependent on oil price developments
2002-05-02;2002;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9852501749992371;the rather protracted upward trend in services prices is also a factor to be taken into account
2002-05-02;2002;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9358527660369873;for next year projections for price developments depend largely on the assumption of continued wage moderation
2002-05-02;2002;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9748042821884155;the outcome of the ongoing wage negotiations in some regions of the euro area could become a matter of concern
2002-05-02;2002;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9836295247077942;excessive wage increases could create additional cost pressure with potential consequences not only for prices but also  to an even greater extent  for employment creation and real gdp growth
2002-05-02;2002;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9801011085510254;regarding fiscal policies in the euro area let me reiterate the views previously expressed
2002-05-02;2002;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9557808041572571;it is vital that those member states that have not already done so manage the transition to budgetary positions in balance or in surplus so that the stability and growth pact can operate smoothly and effectively in future
2002-05-02;2002;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9922208189964294;commitments made to achieving balanced budgets by 20034 must therefore be honoured by the member states concerned
2002-05-02;2002;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9191426634788513;the governing council calls upon member states to make faster progress in implementing comprehensive structural reforms  in public expenditure and revenues and product labour and financial markets
2002-05-02;2002;May;REPORT;Positive;0.6178385615348816;the forthcoming finalisation of the broad economic policy guidelines for 2002 will be an opportunity both to take stock of the unfinished agenda following the agreements of lisbon and more recently of barcelona and in particular to accelerate the implementation of reforms
2002-05-02;2002;May;REPORT;Positive;0.5341163873672485;as we have said on numerous occasions such reforms are needed to increase the growth of real gdp and employment on a sustainable basis
2002-05-02;2002;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.5398202538490295;past experiences both inside and outside the european union indicate that measures to promote the efficiency and integration of markets the encouragement of entrepreneurship and the fostering of a knowledgebased economy are clearly working in this direction and are thus in the interest of all member countries
