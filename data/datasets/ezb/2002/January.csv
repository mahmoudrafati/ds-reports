2002-01-03;2002;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9855263233184814;we have therefore decided to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged
2002-01-03;2002;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9827945828437805;we also confirmed that the current level of key ecb interest rates remains appropriate for the maintenance of price stability over the medium term
2002-01-03;2002;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9369704127311707;starting with the analysis under the first pillar of our monetary policy strategy the threemonth average of the annual growth rates of m3 rose to 74 in the period from september to november 2001 from 67 in the period from august to october
2002-01-03;2002;January;REPORT;Negative;0.8201115131378174;these high levels of the growth rate of m3 over the past few months reflect a particularly marked preference for liquid holdings by euro area investors in an economic and financial environment characterised by exceptionally high uncertainty worldwide
2002-01-03;2002;January;REPORT;Negative;0.562073290348053;however this should remain a temporary phenomenon which does not indicate future inflationary pressures
2002-01-03;2002;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9713218212127686;this judgement notwithstanding the continued acceleration of m3 and the ongoing process of building up liquidity will require a thorough analysis of monetary developments in the months to come
2002-01-03;2002;January;REPORT;Positive;0.8053714632987976;regarding the second pillar recent information has confirmed our earlier assessment that economic activity in the euro area was weak in the second half of 2001 and will probably remain so in early 2002 however there are signs which point to a gradual recovery in the course of this year as reflected for example in financial market developments or in recent survey data which indicate that the decline in confidence may have bottomed out
2002-01-03;2002;January;REPORT;Positive;0.99090975522995;there are no fundamental imbalances which would require a longer correction process and the general positive conditions for an improvement in economic activity remain in place
2002-01-03;2002;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9910063147544861;financing conditions in particular are very favourable and the expected further decline in consumer price inflation will lead to higher growth in real disposable income which should support domestic demand

2002-01-03;2002;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9288228750228882;continued close monitoring of further incoming information is thus warranted
2002-01-03;2002;January;REPORT;Negative;0.8718122243881226;in the current economic environment we do not expect mediumterm upward pressures on inflation
2002-01-03;2002;January;REPORT;Negative;0.7332196235656738;however as has been stated several times in the past annual inflation rates for the months to come may be somewhat erratic on account of base effects as a consequence of the unwinding of past increases in energy prices and albeit to a lesser extent in food prices
2002-01-03;2002;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9451302886009216;in this connection the possibility of some shortlived upward movements in the annual rate of inflation cannot be ruled out but this should not be a cause for concern
2002-01-03;2002;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.7817578911781311;likewise downward shifts resulting from such base effects later in the spring should not signal a change in the longerterm outlook for price stability
2002-01-03;2002;January;REPORT;Positive;0.45376360416412354;as regards the cash changeover we do not expect any noticeable effect on the price level largely due to strong competition in the retail sector continued awareness on the part of consumers and the commitment of governments not to increase the average level of administered prices however we will of course remain vigilant
2002-01-03;2002;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9896467328071594;beyond shortterm developments we expect that wage moderation in the euro area will continue and that demand pressure on prices will remain subdued although there are some grounds for concern about forthcoming wage negotiations
2002-01-03;2002;January;REPORT;Negative;0.5609771013259888;it is therefore particularly important to point to the indispensable role of continued wage moderation in fostering employment and maintaining a favourable outlook for price stability

2002-01-03;2002;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9119549989700317;let me also stress today how important it is for fiscal policies to maintain a mediumterm orientation within the framework of the stability and growth pact
2002-01-03;2002;January;REPORT;Negative;0.991750180721283;the current weakness in economic growth undoubtedly presents a particular challenge for those countries which have not yet attained budgetary positions close to balance or in surplus or which have high public debttogdp ratios
2002-01-03;2002;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9899790287017822;however rather than being detrimental to a return to sustainable economic growth their adherence to their mediumterm objectives will strengthen consumer and investor confidence
2002-01-03;2002;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9814074039459229;countries without fiscal imbalances can of course allow automatic stabilisers to operate fully
2002-01-03;2002;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.6923470497131348;that said however there is no case for fiscal activism
2002-01-03;2002;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.4800933003425598;finally i should like to reiterate our views on structural reform  particularly following the successful introduction of the euro banknotes and coins

2002-01-03;2002;January;REPORT;Positive;0.7986299991607666;together with continued wage moderation aimed at sustaining recent labour market gains these reforms will foster employment and investment
2002-01-03;2002;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9812011122703552;with the ecb pursuing its primary objective of price stability with governments willing to foster structural reforms and conduct stabilityoriented fiscal policies and with wage developments consistent with job creation and price stability the euro  which is now also available in the form of banknotes and coins  will represent an economic area characterised by macroeconomic stability and economic dynamism
