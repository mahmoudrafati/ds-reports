2002-11-07;2002;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9731667637825012;however given the current economic environment we do not see the risk of this translating into inflationary pressure in the near future
2002-11-07;2002;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9549946188926697;concerning the second pillar recent shortterm conjunctural indicators and survey data suggest that real gdp in the euro area has continued to grow only moderately in the third quarter of this year

2002-11-07;2002;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9837747812271118;the expectation of an improvement in economic activity in the euro area is contingent on a recovery of growth in private consumption supported by a reduction in actual and perceived inflation rates
2002-11-07;2002;November;REPORT;Positive;0.992861807346344;this expectation is also based on a projected gradual recovery of the world economy and export growth which together with the low level of interest rates should help to strengthen investment

2002-11-07;2002;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9214198589324951;it is therefore very difficult at this juncture to predict the timing and strength of the economic upswing both in the euro area and globally

2002-11-07;2002;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8992200493812561;although difficult to anticipate particularly due to the volatility of oil prices a further increase in the annual rates of inflation around the turn of the year and a delay in the return to inflation rates below 2 cannot be ruled out
2002-11-07;2002;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9159637689590454;however this further increase should only be temporary
