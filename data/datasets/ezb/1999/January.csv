1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9493252038955688;ecb press conference introductory statement willem f duisenberg president of the european central bank thursday 7 january 1999 with the transcript of the questions and answers ladies and gentlemen the vicepresident and i are here today to report on the outcome of the first meeting of the governing council of the european central bank in stage three of economic and monetary union
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9920735955238342;for the first time the governing council took decisions of an operational nature in the context of the single monetary policy
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.7834505438804626;on 1 january 1999 the euro was successfully launched
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.8880692720413208;from that day onwards the eurosystem  that is the ecb and the eleven national central banks of the member states that participate in the euro  has assumed responsibility for the conduct of monetary policy in the euro area with the primary objective of maintaining price stability
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9652908444404602;the governing council today expressed its satisfaction with the changeover to one integrated euro area money market in the initial days
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Positive;0.8591523170471191;money market interest rate differentials across countries were significant only in the first few hours of 4 january 1999 but narrowed quickly thereafter indicating that credit institutions were efficiently using arbitrage possibilities within the single money market
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9901041388511658;as you will recall the governing council of the ecb decided at its previous meeting that the corridor established by the interest rates on the eurosystems standing facilities would as a transitional measure be kept narrow
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9806493520736694;this was achieved by setting the marginal lending rate and the deposit rate at 325 and 275 respectively for the period of 421 january 1999 we observed a relatively large recourse by credit institutions to these facilities in the first few days of stage three
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.8683024048805237;to some extent this is not surprising since the spread between the eurosystems marginal lending facility and the overnight money market rate has been relatively small
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.985779881477356;as we noted after our last meeting the measure of a narrow corridor is aimed at facilitating the transition to the new regime by market participants
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Negative;0.8286498188972473;however we also noted then that over a longer period of time such a measure would hamper the development of an efficiently functioning euro area money market
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9864208698272705;we therefore confirm our intention to terminate this transitional measure following the next meeting of the governing council on 21 january 1999 on 22 december 1998 the interest rate on the first main refinancing operation of the eurosystem was set at 30 with the intention to maintain this level for the foreseeable future
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.6300768256187439;this first operation of the eurosystem was successfully settled today
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Positive;0.8194608092308044;the decision on the amount of liquidity allocated to the banking system eur 75 billion is aimed at providing sufficient liquidity to allow credit institutions on aggregate to neutralise their reserve deficit relatively soon within the first reserve maintenance period
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9332742691040039;it was taken on the basis of the liquidity conditions in the whole euro area money market while paying due attention to the uncertainties related to the phasingin of the new system
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9452065825462341;let me now turn to the governing councils discussion on recent monetary financial and economic developments and the decisions that the governing council has taken today in the field of monetary policy
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9729210734367371;at todays meeting the governing council reviewed the latest data
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.978124737739563;the new pieces of information have not altered in any significant way the outlook for price developments
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9922707080841064;the governing council therefore decided that for the main refinancing operations to be announced on 11 and 18 january 1999 the same conditions will apply as for the first one ie
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9672382473945618;they will be fixed rate tenders conducted at an interest rate of 30
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9700718522071838;a separate press release has already been issued on these ecb interest rate decisions at 615 pm today
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9844557046890259;furthermore i should like to recall that the first longerterm refinancing operation will be announced on 12 january 1999 and settled on 14 january 1999 it will be conducted as a variable rate tender using the single rate auction procedure
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9829456806182861;let me report in some more detail on the governing councils regular assessment of monetary financial and economic conditions and thereby provide the explanations for our decisions of today
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9895435571670532;on 30 december 1998 we released to the public the first of the monthly statements on recent monetary developments in the euro area
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9783651232719421;the 12month growth rate of the broad monetary aggregate m3 decreased from 50 in october to 45 in november 1998 the latest threemonth moving average of m3 growth covering the months september to november 1998 was approximately 47
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Negative;0.7768262624740601;this result was similar to the value estimated for the threemonth period of august to october 1998 which was revised upwards from the figure of 45 published on 14 december 1998 and remains very close to the reference value of 4 12 set by the governing council on 1 december 1998 with respect to the broadly based outlook for price developments and risks to price stability financial market developments may be seen as indicating a favourable assessment of the recent monetary policy decisions of the eurosystem signalling that financial market participants expect the environment of price stability to continue
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9662363529205322;in this connection i could mention the fall in longterm interest rates in the last couple of days to new historical lows and also the yield curve has shifted down
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.8622666597366333;no major news has come in on the outlook for the euro area economy since we met last time
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Negative;0.993533730506897;hence we continue to face uncertainties originating from the evolution of the world economy in 1999 which are reflected in a weakening of industrial confidence in the euro area over recent months
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9339556097984314;also euro area real gdp growth in the third quarter weakened when compared with the first half of 1998 on the other hand consumer confidence remained high until late 1998 this mixed picture is also reflected in other indicators
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9807730913162231;order books and capacity utilisation point to a less optimistic outlook while retail sales and the recent pattern in employment and unemployment suggest more favourable trends
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9741263389587402;in general this pattern of mixed evidence appears to characterise the economic situation in the euro area around the turn of the year and we shall continue to carefully monitor developments
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9882892370223999;with respect to the latest data on the harmonised index of consumer prices the annual increase for november 1998 showed a further slowdown to 09 compared with 10 in the two previous months
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9806063771247864;this development was in line with previous trends ie
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Negative;0.8570765852928162;it was mainly due to lower annual percentage changes in the prices of food and a further reduction in energy prices
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9699047207832336;on balance the general environment continues to suggest that there is no significant upward or downward pressure on prices in the short term
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9902483820915222;the pattern of risks to price stability has remained broadly unchanged
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9915743470191956;on the one hand downward pressures could materialise if import or producer prices were to fall further while on the other wage developments would become a matter of concern if wage increases were higher than expected
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9807924628257751;in addition any relaxation of fiscal policies would negatively affect the price climate as well as the credibility of the stability and growth pact
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9870167374610901;in conclusion taking into account the latest evidence available the governing council has not altered its assessment regarding the outlook for price developments
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9923517107963562;this is why as i already mentioned the governing council decided that for the two forthcoming main refinancing operations the same conditions will apply as for the first one ie
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9672382473945618;they will be fixed rate tenders conducted at an interest rate of 30
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9866930842399597;we also confirm our intention to maintain this rate for the foreseeable future
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9806550741195679;i should now like to inform you about the governing councils review of the changeover to the euro
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9041615128517151;first and foremost i am happy to be in a position to report that overall the transition to the euro within the eurosystem and the banking and financial industry has been accomplished to our satisfaction
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.891693651676178;with regard to the changeover weekend itself the ecb informed you by means of a first press release issued in the evening of 3 january 1999 that there had been no reports of any incidents that would have impaired the smooth start of the system
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9081977009773254;with regard to the first experiences of our operational existence let me focus in particular on the performance of the target system
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9303318858146667;overall during the first days of operation the target system has functioned well
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9551697969436646;target has contributed substantially to the integration of the euro money market and it has made possible the consolidation of the treasury management of institutions with different activity centres throughout europe
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9675886034965515;target has handled more crossborder payments than anticipated in these early days of monetary union and in doing so has demonstrated its processing capacities
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.8078598976135254;the problems which are being experienced in this initial period can be regarded as teething troubles after all it is completely normal for operators  both in commercial banks and at the central bank level  to need some time to adapt to the system and to the new euro environment
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9762076735496521;in this respect it is worth noting that more than 5000 credit institutions are currently participating directly in target
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.985737681388855;the value of crossborder transactions settled through target already exceeded eur 310 billion on the second operating day and this figure does not yet include domestic rtgs transactions which themselves accounted for at least another eur 660 billion
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9808046221733093;the total value of transactions settled was therefore almost eur 1000 billion
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.8892707824707031;in addition to the news concerning target the ecb also informed you by means of a press release on 5 january 1999 that its first refinancing operation  announced on 4 january 1999  was completed successfully
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.6351287364959717;also here the governing council obviously recognised that a learning process is still under way
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.988255500793457;the governing council will continue studying the best ways to adapt the liquidity provision to the changing conditions of this initial period
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9652251601219177;as a final point as indicated at our press conference on 22 december 1998 the governing council today revisited the issue of frontloading euro banknotes and coins
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9917781352996826;the governing council holds the view that frontloading of euro banknotes and coins to the general public is excluded by articles 10 and 11 of council regulation ec 97498 on the introduction of the euro since it would have the same effect as issuing or putting them into circulation
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9914343357086182;however frontloading of euro banknotes and coins is considered legally possible to credit institutions and security carriers as well as to other organisations eg
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9307208061218262;retailers and vending companies if but only if legal or contractual arrangements can be put in place in each national legal system in order to ensure that euro banknotes and coins will not be put into circulation prior to 1 january 2002 we stand ready to answer any questions you may have
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.8343101143836975;transcript of the questions asked and the answers given by dr willem f duisenberg president of the ecb and christian noyer vicepresident of the ecb question the teething problems that you mentioned for target can you describe what the main problems have been even if they are teething problems exactly what form they have taken
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.8179120421409607;noyer the main problems have not been technical ones and they have not been problems linked to target itself
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9439258575439453;they have been mainly problems linked to human factors mainly in commercial banks
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9495181441307068;the cause might also have been some times in the central banking system but mainly in commercial banks
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9653825759887695;small errors made in addresses for payments or that sort of thing so that the payment did not arrive at the exact time when it was deemed to be received by the receiver
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Negative;0.6859369277954102;that sort of problem you know developed in some cases but  because of this  all problems identified have been repaired in a relatively short time
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9185743927955627;this is why we are rather confident
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.7536876201629639;of course issues may appear that we have not yet discovered
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Negative;0.8341758251190186;but for the time being no failure or real difficulty in the system itself has appeared and all problems which appeared so far to have been solved in a relatively short time
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Negative;0.5693432092666626;duisenberg and i want to emphasise once again that for today there were no problems whatsoever
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.5398247241973877;simply the amount of payments to be handled was so enormously large and is growing so fast that it was the larger banks in some countries which simply were not able to handle them in time
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9219791293144226;question mr president and mr vicepresident is the ecb aware of the fact that in several or many european commercial banks to exchange paper money at the counter now between two euroland currencies is more expensive than before significantly more expensive than before
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.7283392548561096;duisenbergi wasnt aware of that fact
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Negative;0.5982447266578674;question translation mr duisenberg over the past few days there have been a whole range of issues of government paper on the european capital market
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9121110439300537;how do you assess this wave of issuing activity
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.939663290977478;is the reason to fear an increase in interest rates at the long end and is there not a need for a harmonisation of the issuing calendar in the 11 european countries
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Negative;0.6036227345466614;duisenberg we have not discussed this today in the governing council but on one thing  on interest rates  i would like to say that it is our impression that the way in which longterm interest rates in particular have developed over the last few days can be interpreted as an indication that inflationary expectations of the market remain very very subdued indeed and that there are thus no expectations in the market of a change even in the longer term
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.8836584687232971;noyerif i may add something
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9358524680137634;i suppose that you are referring to some issuing that has taken place this week particularly in germany and france
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9370278716087341;but this was related to a calendar established well in advance in both cases
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9597272276878357;on top of that i know we know that governments treasuries have discussed together sort of a harmonisation of calendars
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9508482813835144;harmonisation is perhaps not the proper word but they have exchanged their calendars what they foresee to issue to avoid as far as possible to have a lot of issues on the same day
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9446055293083191;so this process is going on but for the total amount the president has just answered that there is no reason to think that there is any change
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9439539313316345;question mr duisenberg you stressed again the phrase for the foreseeable future
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.8780190348625183;could you explain more explicitly what it means
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9628288745880127;is it just a diplomatic phrase not to say that you want to say anything or could this foreseeable future end on 21 january 1999
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.8962064385414124;duisenberg we do not put a horizon to our future that we can see
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.948762059211731;contrary to you i come from a very flat country where we can always see the horizon which is very far there
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9732527732849121;so it certainly does not imply any date as you indicated that will be the end of our foreseeable future
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9307453632354736;as far as we can see now we see no tendency which would force us to change interest rates in the future as far as we can foresee it
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9510284066200256;question translation president duisenberg the euro euphoria over the past few days must be satisfying to you but is it not also reason for some concern because in the long run as you know confidence in a currency is something that is difficult to build up
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Negative;0.5159227848052979;a second question given that there is such euphoria what must policymakers do to ensure that such confidence is actually established
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9568865299224854;duisenberg we as a central bank should continue to behave the way as we do ie
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Positive;0.8389872312545776;come up with clear and transparent decisions which gain the credibility and gain the confidence that we indeed will be successful in achieving our aim which is price stability over the medium term
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Positive;0.5138481855392456;what politics should do is also to continue to strive for a stabilityoriented policy particularly in the fiscal sphere also in order to gain the confidence of the people and thereby to firmly establish this idea of euphoria so that it becomes an idea which is settled in the minds of the people
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Positive;0.6623811721801758;it will no longer be euphoria but it will be confidence and credibility that we are after
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9084882736206055;question translation mr duisenberg today there has been renewed calls for a stabilisation of exchange rates from mr lafontaine in brussels
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9785593152046204;such calls have also been heard in tokyo and mr chirac has likewise again spoken out in its favour
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9737548828125;a meeting of the g7 countries has been scheduled to take place on 20 february in bonn
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9328934550285339;will you be participating in this meeting and what message and conviction will you express with respect to this issue
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.672707200050354;duisenberg when i go to bonn and i will go i will give the message to those who will listen there that we as the central bank are interested first and foremost in achieving our statutory aim ie
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Positive;0.8352243304252625;internal price stability
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.984963595867157;the exchange rate for the central bank is not an explicit aim
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.989202082157135;it is one of the indicators we will look at at its development together with a broad range of other indicators in determining our policy decisions
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.8574002981185913;but then one cannot repeat often enough that the impact of the exchange rate on the domestic european economy is much less than we were used to in the fragmented markets when we were still eleven different markets with ten different exchange rate regimes
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9846150279045105;as you know exports account for only 10  11 of the combined gdp and which makes the impact of exchange rate variations comparable to those in the united states or japan
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Positive;0.7541612386703491;so most of all we are interested in stable internal prices and secondary we are also interested in a stable exchange rate development
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9744747281074524;but that is the outcome of policies rather than as the aim
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9431269764900208;question mr president i was asked to put forward a further question on the same issue the euro exchange rate policy
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9476110339164734;could you inform us about any exchange rate interventions during the last days to support the euro or the dollar
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9624243378639221;and if you cannot inform us about that  for obvious reasons i would like to ask if for internal price stability revaluation would be needed would you prefer to have this revaluation in short run or in the longer run more gradually
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9730048775672913;duisenberg i did not inform you about interventions although i could easily mention a figure the figure is zero but then we do not have an exchange rate policy we have a policy aimed at achieving price stability and we do not have an explicit exchange rate policy or exchange rate aim visàvis other major currencies
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9352141618728638;thats about all i can say about that
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9241954684257507;question i have a question the euro has been not as strong as it has been in the first days
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.919110119342804;are you happy with that tendency that is the first question and then the second question is similar to the one of the colleague the americans have always been saying the dollar is our currency and its your problem
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9809167981147766;are you saying that europeans will say the same with the euro
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9708455204963684;duisenberg i was happy when the euro took off with a very strong start
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9324119091033936;i was equally happy when yesterday the euro came down again somewhat visàvis the dollar in the direction of the value it had right at the start of the conversion and im equally happy today that again the euro rebounded somewhat to a level when we left the bank of usd 11675 so ive been happy for three days already and will that be as i said earlier
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9800100922584534;there will of course not be any neglect neither malign neglect nor benign neglect of the exchange rate
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9924180507659912;the exchange rate will be one of the indicators we closely watch in determining our monetary policy decisions but only one of them
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.6572265028953552;question mr duisenberg i just wanted to come back to these teething troubles
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9152839183807373;well what are these troubles
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.6592678427696228;there has been reference to the target system but are these problems which are encountered by the european monetary market as a whole and could we say that if more than 20 billion has to be covered on a single day by you is that what you mean by teething troubles or if this doesnt depend upon target if target doesnt really have any problems are there other problems which have been encountered or can you say no there arent any other problems
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9537758231163025;duisenberg structural problems and the problems which mr noyer has just indicated the problems that there were mainly the result of human errors and sometimes human ignorance
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Negative;0.8423156142234802;the operational personnel at the various commercial banking institutions has to get used to the new techniques even to writing the new instructions to their computer there sometimes they make mistakes which they will learn to avoid in the very near future but which then cause hiccups in the smooth process of transferring these large payments from one country to another
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Positive;0.6900475025177002;so far it looks like there are no systemic problems with target target is functioning extremely well
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.8088194727897644;to be quite honest the teething problems or birth pangs or whatever you may want to call them were rather smaller than we had thought at some moment that they might emerge
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9813156723976135;we regard it as quite normal that there are these problems
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.8664965629577637;if you suddenly switch over to a realtime gross settlement payment system crossboarder which as i indicated already within three days turns out to be the largest in the world encompassing more than 5000 credit institutions it is no wonder that there may be some ripples in the water sometimes but thatll settle down
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9438835978507996;question there is one additional question to target which consequences does it have this closing down later
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9451839923858643;can you quantify it that it brings additional costs to the banks and how much
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9647701382637024;duisenberg no on the contrary it is more or less the result of the banks the banks eagerness to be able to make more and more transfers even on this day and they asked for that only in their own interest
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Negative;0.8159099221229553;i can assure you this does not create more costs
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9758589863777161;question my question is quite similar to the one before but id like to have your opinion about the forex control system that the german and japanese government suggest
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.8639654517173767;what can you do to control forex rates when you have the big power now
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.6918694972991943;duisenberg well what can i do is a lot but what i want to do is nothing
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9426538944244385;its as simple as that
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.8630848526954651;i mean the same question was put to mr greenspan a few weeks ago when we had this exchange here in frankfurt and greenspan said its simply not feasible at the moment
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9815064668655396;well im inclined to listen carefully to what he says and then to have a similar opinion
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.8397855162620544;question id just like to talk to you about gold reserves
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9605699181556702;the ecb said it will readjust the value of its gold reserves on its books each quarter and i think it is also decided to keep about 15 of its exchange reserves in gold
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9704848527908325;if there was a major change in the price of gold on the world market that percentage would be likely to change and so i would like to ask you if that means that the ecb would buy or sell gold in order to keep its proportion of reserves at that amount of percent
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.8716562390327454;duisenberg christian youre the gold man
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9818708896636963;noyer no there is no such conclusion to draw because it was not a decision to hold 15 of foreign exchange reserves in gold as a structural decision of the governing council
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9832462668418884;the decision of the governing council at the time was that in the initial transfer 15 would be made of gold but that has no consequence on the structure of foreign exchange reserve to develop in the future nor has it any consequence on the total percentage of gold holdings of the system including the reserves that are still in the balance sheet of national central banks and we know that in some cases they have more than 15 gold and in some cases they have less but they are for the moment and for the foreseeable future keeping the proportion they have
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.6337004899978638;duisenberg and in this case the foreseeable future is much longer than in the earlier case
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9165971279144287;question mr duisenberg the fact that the euro has got off to such a good start is to some extent an expression of confidence in you and can we expect you to stay for eight years
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9248344302177429;duisenberg this is for the first time that i give the answer which i announced i would give already on 31 december 1998 that is no comment
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.8825279474258423;question concerning target you spoke about human errors in dealing with this and i would like to know if you can be more specific about in which countries did these errors happen in what areas of euroland did they happen
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.8378660678863525;and the second question is the fact that there were human errors does it mean that the people were not prepared enough that the technology didnt take into account the human possibilities
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.8231921792030334;duisenberg no it means very different things
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9552996754646301;in all countries errors were being made but they were of a minor nature and i mean people also have the right to make errors
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9925388693809509;they were of a minor nature only during two days it so happened that use was made of a rule that any single central bank can ask towards the closing time of the payment system for an extension of opening time by one hour
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9665356278419495;now this extension in fact was asked for the first day and the second day
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.8660778999328613;on the third day yesterday it was not asked
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9812629818916321;so yesterday everything already operated  i would not say normally but at least within the limits set
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9087120294570923;today again there was a request to extend it by 12 hour due not in this case to any faults or errors in the system or the participating institutions but due to the enormous amount of payments that still had to be processed in order to be able to be processed within this single day
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.8712552785873413;and the causes well they differ
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Negative;0.7720279693603516;it was simply making errors in the techniques in some cases also we think that the number of personnel that is engaged with executing these payments is not sufficient to handle this enormous amount of payments as it is developing
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Negative;0.8373336791992188;in a way today for example as the experts at the bank said to me what happens today is that target is a victim of its own success
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9352417588233948;question in octobernovember several people  you mr tietmeyer  were talking about a scope to cut rates and in fact we did have the coordinated rate cut on december the 3rd
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9183561205863953;now you are saying rates are on hold for the foreseeable future
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.8302204608917236;does that indicate that we no longer have an easing bias and more a neutral bias as far as rates are concerned
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.6942708492279053;duisenberg effectively there has been a considerable easing in the course of last year to the extent that the average three months rates have in the course of last year gone down by slightly more than 100 basis points and one third of that easing has happened in the last month in december
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9385084509849548;and for now i think i would agree with you that there is no bias any longer in either direction
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Positive;0.5831047296524048;question one more time about the exchange rate there are in the market at least expectations that the euro will get at least moderately stronger in the near future
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.936724841594696;do you have the same kind of expectations or do you see this level that we now have that it will stay so in the foreseeable future
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9180575609207153;duisenberg if i had expectations i wouldnt tell you
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9718374013900757;sorry but when you talk to a central banker about exchange rates always expect either no answer or expect a lie
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9341555237770081;question of course journalists arent as well informed as you and there are some important questions that we didnt ask at the start of the year so maybe you could help us now
1999-01-07;1999;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.8171700835227966;duisenberg i think you have asked everything which was important
