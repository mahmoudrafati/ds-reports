1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9541409611701965;furthermore the gradual improvement in the real economic situation may have fostered the expansion of m3

1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Negative;0.7031937837600708;while it is likely that this increase is related to expectations of a recovery of activity in the euro area expectations of increasing inflationary pressure may also play a role
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9875255823135376;the more favourable expectations for economic development in the euro area are partly connected with a further improved outlook for the world economy as is also reflected in the recent upward revision of the forecast for world growth by the imf

1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Negative;0.8698720932006836;however these data do not appear to impinge on the view that there is an upturn in growth in the course of this year
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9920322895050049;in fact industrial production data for the period up to july confirm the gradual improvement of recent months and various survey data suggest that there was a further strengthening of output growth in the industrial sector over the summer months

1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Positive;0.6346176266670227;in line with our expectations the annual rate of change in the harmonised index of consumer prices hicp saw a further rise in august 1999 to 12 up from 11 a month earlier
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9411131143569946;this upward movement was mainly caused by the ongoing increase in oil prices
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9517642259597778;some counterweight came from a decline in unprocessed food prices and from a lower rate of increase in services prices
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9634144902229309;largely reflecting this development in services prices the hicp rate excluding more volatile components  namely energy and seasonal food  declined to 09 in august having risen to 10 in july
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Negative;0.7124135494232178;oil prices continued to increase further in september and given the relatively short time of passthrough to consumer prices expectations of further increases in the overall hicp rate in the coming months have become firmer

1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.6212694048881531;seen in isolation the increase in energy prices should have only a temporary effect upon consumer price increases but it is essential that this effect does not trigger wage claims which prove incompatible with price stability in the medium term
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9256867170333862;against the background of the mediumterm outlook for a sustained acceleration in economic activity decisive structural reform is warranted in order to prevent early upward pressure on prices
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9887304902076721;in fact the governing council sees a strong case for enhancing structural reform in labour and product markets
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9659894704818726;the anticipation of an expected cyclical improvement should not lead to a weakening of efforts in this regard but rather it should be used as a welcome opportunity to make convincing progress
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9863779544830322;this together with continued wage moderation and fiscal adjustment in line with the stability and growth pact would greatly facilitate the monetary policy task of maintaining price stability in an environment of stronger growth
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9848905205726624;let me now give the floor to the vicepresident to introduce three additional topics which we discussed during our meeting in addition to reviewing the main monetary financial and other economic indicators the governing council formally adopted the decision of the ecb on fraud prevention according to which an independent antifraud committee will be established to enforce an antifraud scheme within the ecb

1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.936180830001831;against this background the governing council has already considered a number of issues related to eu enlargement in areas of relevance to the eurosystem
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9696977734565735;furthermore the governing council has decided to organise a highlevel seminar between the eurosystem and the central banks of the 12 accession countries to be held in helsinki on 1012 november 1999 following a number of bilateral contacts which the ecb has already had this year the meeting in helsinki will be attended by the governors of the central banks of the accession countries
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Positive;0.8236543536186218;it will provide the opportunity to strengthen the working relationships between the eurosystem and the central banks of accession countries and to deepen the dialogue between the two sides

1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9800548553466797;with the approval of these links the number of links which are currently eligible to be used by the eurosystem increased from 26 to 47 you will find further information relating to this decision in the separate press release which has been issued today
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9318070411682129;we are now at your disposal should you have any questions
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8557599782943726;transcript of the questions asked and the answers given by dr willem f duisenberg president of the ecb and christian noyer vicepresident of the ecb question translation mr duisenberg on your comments now if you are looking at the two pillars of your strategy then you have strengthened expectations of a further tightening of interest rates or is that wrong
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9104753136634827;because you are looking at the money supply and you are saying that there are no further distortions than there were at the beginning of the year
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9941089153289795;there is also further pressure from prices and the economy is looking as if it is going better
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9541643857955933;now looking at what vice president noyer said at the parliament and what was said in new york is it true to think that there is a tightening bias which is actually going to lead to a tightening in the near future
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9745547771453857;duisenberg we are of the opinion as we found today that we have already sensed in the euro area effectively for more than a year a rather accommodative stance of monetary policy
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.939903736114502;and we did come to the conclusion that it has served its purpose
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9864083528518677;it has contributed to a resumption of growth in a climate of price stability
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9514600038528442;so now we are indeed assessing whether this period of an accommodative monetary policy stance has lasted long enough
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.7776759266853333;but what we do need is some more evidence to make our conclusions very firm which will lead us to further action
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8420767188072205;question mr president a question
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Negative;0.6414374113082886;you said at the beginning that discussions had been very intense today
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9082473516464233;has it also been a very controversial discussion
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Negative;0.7170501947402954;judging from the statement that we heard last week that might be inferred
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8990682363510132;and the second question is more about the style of the ecb
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9093453288078308;does todays decision not to raise the interest rates signify in any way that we cannot expect a short termoriented ecb policy with preemptive strikes  that this is not your cup of tea the way you are doing monetary policy
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Negative;0.5246187448501587;duisenberg the discussion in the governing council was indeed very intense very thorough but not at all controversial
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9388838410377502;and we reached the conclusions as i just read them to you in great harmony
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Negative;0.6604560613632202;now as far as the preemptive nature of any strikes  if any  are concerned i do want to emphasise again that it is not the inclination of the ecb to play a very activist role in trying to finetune the economy
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9722216129302979;on the other hand any measures taken whenever they are taken will always have to be and will be timely
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.769294261932373;question mr duisenberg my question has to do with the deregulation that is going on in the telecommunications and energy sectors
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9606894850730896;is that something that you see as more of a onetime change that does not matter so much to your monetary policy decisions on inflation or is it a factor that you consider to be a longerterm factor for inflation the deregulation
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8759704828262329;duisenberg well it was not discussed as such at todays meeting
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9466727375984192;but what we do consider is that this deregulation liberalisation and increasing competition in itself might be a process which is rather longterm in character  because it is ongoing
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.979213297367096;question mr duisenberg has there been a formal vote in taking this decision to leave the interest rates unchanged or was it rather the outcome of the discussion
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8539799451828003;duisenberg let me repeat the words i used earlier
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9518277049064636;the discussion was very intense and was conducted and ended in great harmony
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8270858526229858;question mr duisenberg where do we stand
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Negative;0.6077350378036499;before the summer holidays we had a creepingin
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Negative;0.8063410520553589;after the summer holidays it was slowly slowly creeping in
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8192729949951172;and now 
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.5724000930786133;duisenberg 
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Negative;0.5904354453086853;it keeps on creeping
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.739993155002594;question quicker
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Negative;0.7975455522537231;is it still there
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Negative;0.842637836933136;duisenberg i am not good at measuring velocities but  it is still there
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9298586249351501;question can i ask you mr president what exactly were you and your colleagues vice president noyer and mr issing trying to achieve with the remarks that you each made publicly last week
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.5513380765914917;the financial market seems certainly to have taken them as a very strong signal that there would be some action soon and now there is not any action
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8556481599807739;now what message were you trying to communicate last week
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8878520131111145;duisenberg what we were trying to communicate was that we wanted to maintain the tone that we had set in the press conference on 15 july
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8284064531326294;question mr duisenberg you said that the council needed further evidence more data for a firm conclusion on further action
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.731157124042511;can you elaborate on that
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9260162711143494;what are you looking at and what else do you need basically
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9136481881141663;duisenberg well we need not only a closer look but also more data on the developments which i described earlier
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9686177968978882;on monetary developments growth of m3 we will have new data by the end of this month as well as new data on actual price developments and the entire broad range of indicators we look at
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.7752126455307007;so let me say this the bias we discussed earlier is still there in full force
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.853753924369812;but before taking action we need more conclusive evidence confirming our preliminary assessment
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.838305652141571;question what are your preliminary conclusions
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9357881546020508;duisenberg those that i read in the introductory statement
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.913524329662323;question first of all you spoke about this intense discussion that you had about the decision to leave the interest rates unchanged
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9137582778930664;you said it ended in harmony
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9157485365867615;did anybody at all oppose the decision to leave the interest rates unchanged
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8491840958595276;did anybody want to raise interest rates at all at that meeting
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9335826635360718;and the other question is could i possibly just ask you to define precisely what you mean when you speak about a tightening bias
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9442972540855408;just what exactly does it mean
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9355824589729309;duisenberg i am not going to disclose the individual members behaviour
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9570925235748291;i am going to repeat that the discussion was conducted and ended in great harmony
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9474856853485107;we do not use the word bias
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9454750418663025;that was put into our mouths by someone else
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8603947758674622;but we did not deny that the tendency was there
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8465127944946289;neither do we deny that now
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9706776738166809;what we mean with what you call bias i hope that i have clearly described that we have seen monetary developments  already for nine months now  as going in the same direction
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9008646011352539;we see a slow although not unexpected increase in the rate of inflation
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Positive;0.6928800344467163;at the same time we see the resumption of growth occurring in the euro area
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9723620414733887;we see ourselves confirmed in our expectation that this acceleration of growth will continue into the next year and throughout the next year
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9318914413452148;at the same time we conclude that as i said earlier we have now already had a truly accommodative monetary policy stance over effectively more than a year
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.4886833727359772;and we are now turning our mind in our mediumterm outlook to the future realising that we have to adopt and to have a monetary policy stance which is conducive to sustainable noninflationary growth which is somewhat different from the accommodative stance we had in a period when we saw output slowing and inflationary expectations or tendencies even going in a downward direction
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9201955199241638;question mr president when  in your view  is the right time to go up with interest rates
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9255933165550232;when inflation pressure comes up  and it is not really clear how strong it is  or when inflation is very strong in the pipeline
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9344496726989746;because we now really have signs that inflation pressure is coming up slowly
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8957577347755432;duisenberg i cant say when  i can say of course when the time is right
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9285979866981506;that would be the right time
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.7036249041557312;but what we do see  as far as inflation is concerned insofar as we pay attention to current developments  is that inflation is slowly creeping up but  and not unexpectedly  due almost exclusively to the increase in oil prices which is working its way through into consumer prices and which will presumably continue to work its way through
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.981907308101654;at the same time our expectation is that this will continue for a few months but that it will then flatten out
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.7540819048881531;but we also see signs that it might accelerate somewhat further but we need further evidence to confirm this
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Negative;0.8215498328208923;and especially  what i warned against  if a fear which is there were to become true that the current rate of increase in inflation would spill over into secondround effects if we were to see signs of that that would increase our anxiety to say the least
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Negative;0.5278545618057251;question as far as liquidity is concerned you said it is rather generous
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9071933031082153;does this have to do with the year 2000 and how much and how are you considering the y2k development
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9290674924850464;duisenberg we do see that the y2k phenomenon has some impact on future interest rates we see that as a onceandforall impact
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Positive;0.4882728159427643;as to the problem of y2k as such we think and we have published that we have it well under control
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Positive;0.8743953704833984;especially in the payment systems area we have  as you know  conducted extensive tests together with hundreds of private sector financial institutions which have on the whole proven that the financial sector including the central banks is well prepared for the changeover to the new millenium
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.7836410403251648;question mr duisenberg i have two questions concerning the astonishing gold agreement you and 15 other national central banks european central banks reached two weeks ago
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9737876653671265;first will the united kingdom and switzerland the main winners of this agreement compensate the other european central banks in some way because the gold price rose strongly
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9713497161865234;and the second question could this agreement be the nucleus for a central gold selling agency for euro area central banks
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8983082175254822;duisenberg the answer to the second question is no
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.6905859708786011;the answer to the first question is somewhat more complicated
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9674069285392761;you have to realise that the statement by the fifteen participating central banks implied that they would limit their annual sales of gold to an amount of approximately 400 tonnes per year and to an amount not exceeding 2000 tonnes over the next five years
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9815883636474609;there are many plans decided or planned by some central banks
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9847395420074463;but the statement was intended to give some certainty or to take away uncertainty  let me put it that way  in the gold market for five years and then we will review it
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9836024045944214;and we will probably review it sometime ahead of the end of the fiveyear period
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9454379677772522;as far as your question on compensation is concerned i would say that that is not on the agenda given the fact that we know precisely what the uk government intends to do which are sales far below the 400 tonnes per year and they have announced the amounts and the time schedule precisely
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9451944231987;we know preliminarily what the swiss authorities intend to do but i would like to emphasise that the swiss have never announced either when they would start or when they would end
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9395482540130615;so there is no time schedule there
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.5734474062919617;question i also have a question regarding the y2k problem and i know we brought it up last time
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9181898236274719;i would be grateful however if you could answer it again
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9737629890441895;i am not getting at the technical problems liquidity problems
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Negative;0.8812668323516846;i am wondering to what extent do you think that the problems stemming from the fact that economic data may perhaps be distorted
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9313239455223083;to what extent will economic data which is distorted by the y2k effect have an impact on your rate decisions whichever way you want to take it
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.592743992805481;duisenberg well we do not know that yet
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9717487096786499;if there are any distortions we would only be able to draw conclusions from them after they are known
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8172934651374817;question but are you not afraid of them
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8576146960258484;duisenberg i am not afraid of them no
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8899785876274109;question to what extent was the exchange rate of larger or smaller consideration in todays decision
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.876209020614624;duisenberg in todays decision
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9127118587493896;to no extent  neither large nor small
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9195399284362793;question it played no role whatsoever
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9615128040313721;duisenberg well the exchange rate has behaved let me say quite normally over the past lets say four weeks since we last met here
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Negative;0.49451738595962524;it has gradually strengthened somewhat to a level  as it was this morning at 1 oclock  of about usd 10710 then we announced our interest rate decisions and the exchange rate dropped to usd 10660 within five minutes and ten minutes later it was back at usd 10710 so on the whole the movement has not given rise to any unrest or concern
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8772575855255127;question translation mr duisenberg  actually the question is also addressed to mr noyer  do you really feel in your speeches that the general public actually gets to hear what you want to say or do you rather feel that some of your statements are interpreted to an excessive degree
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9340400695800781;duisenberg to mr noyer do you or do i have to answer that question
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8862597346305847;noyer you could do that
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.7850529551506042;but i can simply say that what i have said was exactly along the lines that have been developed in this room in july and september and nothing more
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9287557005882263;perhaps you want to add something because you have also been quoted
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.7215954661369324;duisenberg i have seen that your remarks christian which you made in french seemed suddenly through the translation to adopt quite another meaning and that was a phenomenon which we have to deal with and to cope with
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9769779443740845;but there it was purely translation which gave another interpretation to the remarks than that given in the original language
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8892841935157776;question i have an additional question to the previous question
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9818257093429565;the remarks in french adopted quite another meaning in the english translation
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9313568472862244;what kind of other meaning
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Positive;0.6835477352142334;was it stronger than was originally meant at the beginning
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8466907143592834;it is not so clear
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9884761571884155;duisenberg very specifically in the english translation in the parliament the translators used the word probable in a certain context whereas the word probable did not appear in the french text
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.45751631259918213;question so it was stronger in the translation
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.4567119777202606;duisenberg in the translation it was stronger yes
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9526578783988953;question mr duisenberg i have to go back to the question about the vote whether the decision taken today to leave the rates unchanged was taken without a vote
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.7939141392707825;because i did not exactly understand
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9205266833305359;you talked about a great harmony but you did not say whether it was a harmony with a vote or without
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9574503302574158;duisenberg but the problem  if i answer this question  is that i have to answer it every time which i do not want to do but  for this time  i will make an exception
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9234521389007568;there was no vote
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9475432634353638;question translation please mr president your interpretation of the interpretation of your statements makes me raise the question as to whether you would put things as your colleague mr greenspan always does congressman if you got this right then ive done something wrong
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.6839221715927124;duisenberg i hope not
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9133549332618713;i hope that i will always be perfectly transparent clear and predictable
1999-10-07;1999;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8803402185440063;so i hope to be understood well
