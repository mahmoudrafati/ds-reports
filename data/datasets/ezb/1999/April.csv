1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9526631832122803;ecb press conference introductory statement willem f duisenberg president of the european central bankthursday 8 april 1999 with the transcript of the questions and answers ladies and gentlemen the vicepresident and i are here today to report on the outcome of todays meeting of the governing council
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9627364873886108;let me start with the governing councils discussion of recent economic developments and the decisions that the governing council has taken today in the field of monetary policy
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9894731640815735;after an indepth review of recent monetary financial and economic developments the governing council decided that the interest rate for the ecbs main refinancing operations will from next week on be set at 250
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9846320152282715;in addition the interest rate on the marginal lending facility will be lowered to 350 and the interest rate on the deposit facility to 150 with effect from tomorrow
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9705733060836792;let me report in some more detail on the reasons for which the governing council in the context of the ecbs monetary policy strategy deemed it appropriate to lower interest rates
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9725295305252075;as regards monetary developments in the euro area the acceleration of monetary aggregates seen in january 1999 was partly reversed in february
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.5884150266647339;the 12month growth rate of m3 declined from 56 in january to 52 in february
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9782994985580444;this largely reflected a slowdown in the high pace of growth of overnight deposits presumably reflecting the unwinding of the influence of some special factors related to the start of stage three and the introduction of the euro
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.7682017683982849;as the february figures were somewhat higher than those observed in late 1998 the threemonth moving average of m3 growth covering the period from december 1998 to february 1999 still increased by 02 percentage point to 51
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9915196299552917;the governing council does not regard current monetary trends as constituting a signal of future inflationary pressures taking into account that the rate of growth of m3 is still close to the reference value of 4Â½ and considering that it may to some extent mirror the specific environment related to the start of stage three
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.7395718693733215;the governing council noted that the harmonised index of consumer prices hicp rates of increase for the euro area have now been below 1 for several months and even though some increases are likely to be seen in coming months owing to the reversal of energy price trends the more lasting effect on the outlook for future prices comes from the economic environment
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Negative;0.701184093952179;indeed reflecting the economic environment many projections for future consumer price increases in the euro area have been revised downwards
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Negative;0.7021797299385071;in our current assessment of the situation it appears unlikely that hicp increases will be out of line with the eurosystems definition of price stability
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9767033457756042;with regard to financial indicators both bond and foreign exchange markets were lately under the influence of global factors
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9782439470291138;after having risen somewhat in february 1999 in tandem with us bond yields during march euro area government bond yields remained broadly unchanged
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9630104899406433;at the same time the us dollar strengthened further in recent weeks in the light of international developments
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9911255240440369;when looking in some more detail at the evolution of the world economy positive signs relate to the continuously strong growth of the us economy the gradual recovery in some asian countries and indications of a stabilisation in latin america
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9290507435798645;however there is no noticeable evidence as yet of a turnaround in japan
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9952415227890015;in the euro area overall growth prospects worsened towards the end of last year as reported when we met in early march
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9936308264732361;in the meantime official data confirm that real gdp growth in the euro area weakened in the fourth quarter of 1998 when compared with the previous quarter
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9946370720863342;the weakness is particularly apparent in the manufacturing sector where confidence deteriorated further
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9708430171012878;partial information covering a substantial part of the euro area appears to confirm this picture
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Positive;0.46483805775642395;most recent data on total employment in the euro area point to a certain deceleration in net job creation in the last quarter of 1998 as regards the latest available data on the hicp the annual increase in consumer prices has remained unchanged at 08 over several months up to february 1999 underlying this stable rate of price increases have been offsetting developments at the level of services and goods prices
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9760258197784424;in february services price increases moderated further slightly mainly owing to downward adjustments in prices in the telecommunication area
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9728691577911377;at the same time goods prices contributed slightly more to overall hicp increases than before due both to price developments for unprocessed food and a deceleration in the fall in energy prices
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Positive;0.5605707168579102;it may be worth noting that goods prices may continue to move upwards temporarily in particular as oil prices increased strongly from midfebruary onwards
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9740331172943115;such movements reflect the higher volatility of price changes of some categories of goods in particular imported oil and other commodities
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9887942671775818;the interest rate decision has been taken in a forwardlooking perspective focusing on the mediumterm trends in inflation and the compatibility of these trends with the eurosystems definition of price stability
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9785284399986267;in the view of the governing council monetary growth is  at the current juncture  not a risk for future price stability
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Positive;0.7895699143409729;the decision taken today keeps monetary policy on a longerterm stabilityoriented course and by doing so contributes to creating an economic environment in which the considerable growth potential of the euro area could be exploited
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Positive;0.7567597031593323;those responsible for other policy areas are urged now even more to take the necessary steps to improve longerterm growth prospects for the euro area through strictly and decisively adhering to the aims of the stability and growth pact and through convincing structural reforms in the economy
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9529403448104858;i should now like to inform you about some of the other matters considered today
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9840074181556702;the governing council examined the outcome of a test run of the production of euro banknotes
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9714765548706055;this socalled zero production run involved the printing works of the participating countries
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9865683317184448;the main purposes of this test were first to check the compliance of the test banknotes against the technical specifications and second to prove that all printing works are in a position to produce the euro banknotes to the same high quality standards
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Positive;0.6686905026435852;the result of this test was positive as only some minor technical specifications need to be modified slightly
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9596710801124573;the printing works will now start their final preparations for the commencement of the mass production of the euro banknotes
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9846144318580627;the governing council also decided to establish an analysis centre for counterfeit euro banknotes
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9867261648178101;as is already indicated by its name the main purpose of this analysis centre will be to technically analyse and classify new types of printed counterfeits and to store the related technical data in a database
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9626948237419128;the analysis centre will be located at the ecb in frankfurt
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9318070411682129;we are now at your disposal should you have any questions
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9417567849159241;transcript of the questions asked and the answers given by dr willem f duisenberg president of the ecb and christian noyer vicepresident of the ecb question i would be very interested if you had anything to say about the exchange rate of the euro if the central bankers of europe seem comfortable with it
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.6427174210548401;it seems that the strategy of the ecb is now in light of todays actions a double strategy to reinvigorate the european economy
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8829007744789124;on the one hand you got the exports boosted by the euro and on the other hand you got an interest rate cut to lubricate the economy as well
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9442607164382935;duisenberg first of all as far as the exchange rate of the euro is concerned i always like to take a slightly longer term perspective than is normally done in articles and considerations about it
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9658461809158325;i would like to point out that if you look at the rate of the euro and look back to what we  in our jargon  call the synthetic euro the euro that you can calculate before the euro was in existence then you can observe that the rate of the euro to the dollar has been more or less stable at around a level of usd 108 to usd 110 from the middle of 1997 until early september 1998 in the middle of september it started to rise to reach a level of 116 at the end of the year and that was the level at which we entered the euro era
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9694720506668091;after 1 january it gradually declined again in a few weeks to a level of around usd 108 so we have no reason at all to be dissatisfied with that level
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9707971811294556;it is about the level at which the euro had stood for more than a year
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.931693434715271;and now  to take a very short outlook between 615 and 630 today  the euro rose from usd 108 to usd 10865 i hope that answers your question
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8262712359428406;question i have a question concerning your inflation target
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8889233469963074;can we draw the conclusion that from now we have some kind of informal bottom on your inflation target
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8715969324111938;duisenberg no you cannot draw this conclusion
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9870344996452332;we are sticking to our definition of price stability which says that we regard price stability as being an increase in the rate of inflation of below 2
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8583980202674866;and what i said today is that the present situation and the prospects for the increase in the rate of inflation are such that they seem for as far as we can look forward also to remain well below that ceiling of 2
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9429766535758972;so inflation is not a danger which enabled us to let me say to pay more attention to the second area of objectives of the european central bank  that is to support the general economic policies of the european community
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9322779178619385;question in your meeting today could you describe what the mood was of the meeting and whether there was much debate about your move and much debate about the level of the move and also whether it was an unanimous vote in the end
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Positive;0.8437628746032715;duisenberg the mood was good
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Positive;0.7874773740768433;we had a very long and i must say very interesting discussion today
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9779441356658936;there were a few who were not very inclined to do something about the rate  but here i talk about a very few  and a very large majority was inclined to do something and supported the proposal as we put it before the council
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9430612325668335;and so we had a very good discussion
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9067819118499756;for the final decision i am afraid i have to tell you that we did not take a vote
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.970490574836731;but we know all the different views and so finally i could conclude as follows the governing council decides that the main refinancing rate will be lowered from 3 to 25
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8596830368041992;question you said there were no monetary risks of inflation at the moment
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9312072396278381;can we infer from todays decision that there were monetary risks of deflation or is it purely a growthoriented decision that you have taken today
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8119613528251648;duisenberg no we also see no risks of deflation emerging
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9881096482276917;we see that inflation has now remained on a euro areawide basis constant at a rate of 08 four months in a row up to now
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9916706085205078;we see some risks on the upside ie
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8303377032279968;mainly the impact of rising energy prices but that is by definition as it was when it was on the downside a temporary factor
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9695751667022705;we see some risks deriving from some wage settlements here and there in europe those are the upside risks
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9939723610877991;we see some downside risks from a rather subdued outlook for general economic development in the entire euro area
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Negative;0.963921844959259;but as such the main thing is that we do not see the situation of price stability in which we entered the euro area and which prevails until this moment would be in any way endangered in the future
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9645901918411255;that gave us the leeway to take the measure i have just announced
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9848380088806152;question translation mr president would you say you have admitted today that you are pursuing a business cycleoriented monetary policy which would constitute a change in model compared with the deutsche bundesbank which has always maintained that it does not pursue a business cycleoriented monetary policy but rather that we have a monetary target or a potentialoriented monetary policy which is geared to the medium term
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Negative;0.7170453667640686;are you not facing the danger that such an obvious relaxation of your monetary policy could instead of stimulating reform in other areas of fiscal tax and labour market policy reduce pressure for such reforms
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9555432200431824;duisenberg with the greatest emphasis i am capable of i want to deny that we have in any way switched our strategy or our approach to monetary policy
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.7131279110908508;it is not a cyclically inspired policy
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9887392520904541;may i quote from my statement again the interest rate decision  has been taken in a forwardlooking perspective focusing on the mediumterm trends in inflation and the compatibility of these trends with the eurosystems definition of price stability
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9404564499855042;that is something totally different from a konjunkturgetriebene politik
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Negative;0.5935205221176147;question translation mr duisenberg this interest rate move has turned out to be unexpectedly large
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.6891605257987976;do you believe that you are now at the limit which you can justify in terms of stability policy and how long will this interest rate remain in place if economic activity in the euro zone does indeed pick up in the second half of the year
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9109087586402893;duisenberg this is something we have of course considered in depth
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8161227107048035;we wanted the move to be as convincing as possible and we were afraid that a smaller move would only have led to further expectations for the future that this would only be a first step in a series
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.5715610384941101;we have by all means possible tried to avoid that impression
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9498000144958496;in very parochial words i am inclined to say  and i cannot say do not quote me here i realise that  but i am inclined to say that we moved from 3 to 25 which is maybe a slightly unexpectedly large fall but i would like to add and now you be sure this is it
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.6425451636314392;question mr duisenberg i just want to ask if you could elaborate a little bit on the convincing structural reforms that you said you would like to see from euro zone governments and also if you feel that by cutting the rates in such a large step that you actually reduce the pressure on these governments to make these reforms
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8691602349281311;duisenberg we hope that the contrary will emerge over time
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Negative;0.4916343092918396;convincing structural reforms relate to the following we and most other observers are very convinced that the phenomenon of an unacceptably high rate of unemployment across the euro area but particularly in the larger countries in the euro area is due to structural factors and to inflexibility in markets for labour and in markets for goods and services and that monetary policy is neither the cause of that structural unemployment nor is it the solution to it
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Negative;0.6330033540725708;the solution to that problem has to be found in measures of a convincingly reformist nature in the labour and in the goods markets and we do hope that taking the monetary policy stance we have taken today will in the ensuing months increasingly focus the attention of policymakers and the public on the real causes of the unemployment problem because it will demonstrably become clear that monetary policy is not the answer to solve those problems
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.7921819686889648;question do you feel completely certain that this interest rate cut represents no danger of inflation to any part of the euro zone i am thinking in particular of smaller more dynamic economies such as the irish one
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9495072364807129;and secondly is it fair to conclude that the opposition to a rate cut came from the representatives of those countries
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9638522863388062;duisenberg i will not allude to any opposition by anyone in the governing council
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.7428340315818787;we do believe that this rate cut otherwise we would not have done it will not pose any additional threat of inflationary pressures arising either in small or in large counties
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.6525890231132507;question translation president duisenberg with regard to risks and sideeffects
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8907579779624939;first question will you keep the interest rate at 25 even if a recession occurs
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8212865591049194;have we understood you correctly in this respect
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9908673763275146;second is it indeed so that too much capital flowing to the united states at high interest rates flows could become a problem for the external stability of the euro
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.4850822687149048;i mean the higher interest rates in the united states indicate that at the moment still more capital will be flowing to the united states
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Negative;0.5281236171722412;third question did you intend to increase the pressure on lenders ie
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.7012778520584106;also on the banks because your impression was that in the light of the official rate of 3 they were not answering borrowers demands for cheaper loans
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Negative;0.5660521984100342;duisenberg i am not going to speculate about a potential recession if we do not see one coming
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9909482598304749;we see a slowdown in economic development we do not see or do not yet see a recession to be on our hands
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.7802602052688599;so i will not speculate about what we would do if there really were a recession
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9809953570365906;we will cross that bridge when we come to it or as my mother used to say if the skies fall down all the birds are dead
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8928206562995911;interest rates in the united states are higher but you have to realise that the united states is in a totally different phase of the cycle than we are and whether that will in any way induce capital flows to move differently from what they are moving today remains to be seen
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8408059477806091;and the third part of your question was have we in any way made the conclusion that the banks when the rate was 3  were not giving in enough to the demand for credit
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Positive;0.959726870059967;no on the contrary as you know the development of credit to the private sector has been quite buoyant over the past few months although its bias of increase has come down somewhat
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8865159749984741;the last time i was here i reported that credit to the private sector was growing at an annual rate of nearly 10 the latest figure we have now is that it has come down to a rate of slightly over 9
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9432179927825928;but then when you analyse that credit to the private sector and its development it is also very clear that those high rates of growth are particularly present in the smaller countries of europe and not too much in the larger countries although there is quite a difference between the various countries
1999-04-08;1999;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.7933838963508606;so in itself that rate of growth of credit which is already moderating somewhat is not a cause of inflationary concern for us and neither is the move today any inducement to the banks to be more forthcoming in giving credit
