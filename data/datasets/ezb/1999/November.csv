1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9390954375267029;ecb press conference introductory statement willem f duisenberg president of the european central bankthursday 4 november 1999 with the transcript of the questions and answers ladies and gentlemen the vicepresident and i are here to report on todays meeting of the governing council of the ecb
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9844563603401184;the outcome of todays meeting was that the governing council has decided to increase the ecb interest rates
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9554287195205688;the forthcoming main refinancing operations of the eurosystem will be conducted as fixed rate tenders at an interest rate of 30 starting with the operation to be settled on 10 november 1999 this increase implies an upward adjustment of 50 basis points from the rate of 25 applied to previous such operations
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9887153506278992;in addition the interest rate on the marginal lending facility will be increased from 35 to 40 and that on the deposit facility from 15 to 20 both with effect from 5 november 1999 overall on the basis of prospective developments the governing council considers that todays decision will counter the upward trend of the balance of risks to price stability
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9543142914772034;this decision will therefore contribute to sustaining noninflationary economic growth in the euro area over the medium term
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Positive;0.5289387702941895;the main argument for raising the interest rates was the fact that since around the beginning of the summer the balance of risks to future price stability has gradually been moving towards the upside
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9681257009506226;in fact the economic situation in spring 1999 had given rise to concern about downward risks and had led to a precautionary interest rate reduction by 50 basis points on 8 april 1999 however the current economic environment is far more favourable
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9638856053352356;moreover several indicators including monetary growth suggest that there is ample liquidity in the euro area
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.723101794719696;inflation rates are expected to increase gradually in the months ahead mainly as a result of the increase in energy prices earlier this year working its way through to consumer prices
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8010916709899902;the latest data on industrial producer prices confirm this pattern
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Negative;0.616461455821991;over the medium term however it is important to prevent the availability of ample liquidity from translating into upward pressure on prices
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.4915909469127655;in particular an increase in interest rates now should help to counteract further liquidity growth over the medium term and contribute to maintaining inflation expectations safely below 2
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8379818201065063;with regard to the perception that an increase in interest rates now would endanger the resumption of economic growth the governing council is of the opposite opinion
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9907652139663696;a timely rise in interest rates will avoid the need for a larger increase in interest rates later and hence will contribute to stronger growth over an extended period of time
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9530449509620667;concerning the size of an increase in interest rates against the background of a fundamentally changed situation the precautionary interest rate reduction made in april 1999 is no longer justified
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9731478095054626;furthermore todays move by 50 basis points appeared to be the best way in which to avoid uncertainties regarding the future course of monetary policy
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Positive;0.6214146614074707;in addition such a move is expected to contribute to reducing any uncertainty premia potentially prevalent in financial markets and also to help to contain a possible increase in volatility in money markets towards the end of the year
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9923551082611084;under these circumstances the alternative of moving by less than 50 basis points now and examining the need for an additional step later on could potentially introduce unwarranted uncertainty for the period ahead
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9585237503051758;let me now provide you with more detailed information on monetary financial and other economic developments and thereby further explain the decisions taken today
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9749869108200073;with regard to monetary developments in the euro area the monetary data up to september 1999 reinforced the view that m3 growth is on a rising trend
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9872980117797852;the threemonth average of the annual growth rates of m3 covering the period from july to september 1999 was 59 which is almost 1½ percentage points above the reference value of 4½
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Positive;0.987987220287323;this deviation from the reference value has steadily increased during 1999 the strong growth of the most liquid components of m3 is particularly noteworthy suggesting that the very low level of interest rates favoured the strong growth of monetary aggregates
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9895328283309937;the pickup in economic activity is likely to have further stimulated m3 growth
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Positive;0.6192010641098022;credit to the private sector also continued to expand rapidly in september 1999 at a rate in excess of 10
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9911237955093384;the demand for loans remained strong throughout the first three quarters of 1999 supported in particular by the low level of bank lending rates and the ongoing economic recovery
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9306118488311768;overall these developments indicate a generous liquidity situation in the euro area
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9888949394226074;euro area financial market developments over the past few months confirm the general change in economic conditions and perspectives for the euro area by also anticipating an acceleration of economic growth
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9918245673179626;this is reflected in the rise in government bond yields and the associated pronounced steepening of the yield curve since spring 1999 todays decision should contribute to firming financial market expectations of stronger growth without increasing inflationary pressures
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9300116896629333;with regard to economic activity itself current information indeed continues to support the view that there is an ongoing strengthening in the euro area
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9921261072158813;the outlook for the world economy remains positive this mainly relates to the sustained growth of the us economy but also to the apparent strengthening of the recoveries in southeast asia and japan
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9905930161476135;most recent data releases for the euro area suggest an acceleration of real gdp growth rates in the second half of this year
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9225517511367798;this is indicated by confidence and survey data as well as by production data for the industrial sector extending into the third quarter of the year
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Positive;0.988409161567688;therefore the prospects for a continued improvement in output growth remain good
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9613189101219177;concerning consumer prices in september 1999 the annual rate of change in the harmonised index of consumer prices hicp was 12 that is to say unchanged from august 1999 on the one hand upward pressures related to the surge in oil prices in recent months and to the rate of change in prices for seasonal food
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.6404422521591187;on the other hand in september the increases in both services prices and prices for nonenergy industrial goods were more moderate than in august
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.961310088634491;countervailing price movements of such a kind may possibly continue in the coming months while expectations remain that there will be some overall upward movement in the hicp rate in the short term which will mainly be linked to energy prices
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9497835636138916;in conclusion the downside risks to price stability have disappeared
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9879840612411499;instead monetary developments together with the accumulating evidence of improved economic prospects confirmed the view expressed earlier by the governing council that the balance of risks to future price stability has gradually moved towards the upside
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Positive;0.6256672143936157;this assessment argued in favour of adjusting the interest rates within the context of a monetary policy stance which is conducive to maintaining price stability over the medium term
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9330712556838989;containing inflationary expectations in a forwardlooking manner is decisive for ensuring sustainable growth in gdp and employment
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Positive;0.8756008148193359;this would be greatly facilitated if individual member countries were to make convincing progress in the structural reform of the labour and product markets which over the medium term would enhance the euro areas production potential and thereby curb upward pressure on prices as the recovery proceeds
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9734160900115967;together with fiscal consolidation in the context of the stability and growth pact and the necessary moderate wage developments such reforms could make a crucial contribution towards transforming the current cyclical upswing into a process of longerterm noninflationary growth
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.813150942325592;other business in a press release dated 1 july 1999 the ecb indicated that an announcement would be made in november with regard to the decision on the public relations agency selected to prepare and execute a europewide information campaign for the introduction of the euro banknotes and coins on 1 january 2002 in this regard i am now pleased to announce that the governing council has decided to negotiate the contract with publicis
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.932991623878479;further information on this matter can be found in a separate press release which will be issued this afternoon
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8902822732925415;finally i should like to draw your attention to the fact that the second meeting of the governing council to be held in december has been rescheduled
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9072784781455994;as announced yesterday the meeting has been brought forward from thursday 16 december 1999 to wednesday 15 december 1999 in order to enable several governing council members to attend a first gathering of a new forum consisting of ministers of finance and central bank governors the socalled g20 which is to be held in berlin on 16 december 1999 we are now at your disposal should you have any questions
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9054919481277466;transcript of the questions asked and the answers given by dr willem f duisenberg president of the ecb and christian noyer vicepresident of the ecb question mr president in april on lowering the rates you said  this is it
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9058958292007446;do you say this is it today
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.759723424911499;duisenberg yes and no
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8293761610984802;no i cant say that
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9487267732620239;question do you  after the 50 basis point rise  do you see this level as neutral on interest rates
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9559922218322754;duisenberg we dont precisely know what level would be the neutral rate
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9269006252288818;that is a wellknown topic
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8131119608879089;we dont precisely know what it is
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9676609039306641;what we were sure of is that whatever the socalled neutral or balanced rate might be the level of 25 prevailing until today was below it
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9849499464035034;so we can say that this move of today is a move in the direction of the socalled neutral rate even though we do not know where the neutral rate precisely finds itself
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.7268291711807251;question mr president two questions
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Negative;0.8741896152496338;number one at the last press conference you said that there was still some evidence missing before you could hike rates
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9401430487632751;what was the final piece of evidence which made you do todays decision
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9359370470046997;duisenberg there was not a single final piece of evidence
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8389257192611694;we have received a lot of new evidence in the course of this month and not only as some think on m3 growth but also on producer prices across the euro area which are an indication of future price developments in the consumer sphere
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.5805197358131409;we have received evidence  as i have mentioned  on confidence surveys of both consumers and investors and of course a lot of anecdotal evidence coming from the various countries
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9655621647834778;so it was a host of evidence but evidence all pointing in the same direction
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8453781604766846;question second question the ecb in the last few days seems to have gone the extra mile to prepare the market for todays move
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9442273378372192;can we  in contrast to what you did in april for instance where markets were very much surprised by the move  can we expect the ecb to do that extensive lobbying in the future as well
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.6455090641975403;duisenberg i dont know
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9261486530303955;the surprise in april was a surprise not so much about the fact of moving but about the size
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Negative;0.5617896318435669;the fact that we were moving in april was already widely discounted in the markets
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Negative;0.7887272238731384;the size may have been a surprise
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8836644291877747;and i would like to repeat that it is not our policy to catch markets by surprise
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.7831564545631409;we do want to be predictable
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Negative;0.7977176308631897;we do want to be credible which doesnt rule out that on some occasion in the future we may be forced to surprise markets
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9818798303604126;that can then even be a part of policy
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8875300288200378;on the other hand it is not our policy to do so
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8822861313819885;so what you can expect that was your question will there be a continued policy of going the other mile as you put it i would say no but then i dont know
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8898630142211914;question mr president how do expectations on wages fit in your assessment
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.843940794467926;i dont remember that you told us something about that
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.4489190876483917;duisenberg i didnt mention it specifically but in assessing all the indicators we had we paid due attention to the fact that in various regions of euro area there seems to be an acceleration in wage demands which by itself is adding to our conviction that it is about time to raise interest rates
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9173176884651184;question we get the impression that youve taken more account of the risks of overheating in the peripheral euro area member countries than of the real situation in the core euro area economies france germany and italy
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8360424041748047;especially the last two
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9875122904777527;arent you worried that this interest rate rise which reverses the april cut will have negative consequences for the resumption of growth in germany and italy
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.906369686126709;duisenberg by no means
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Positive;0.7658251523971558;we think that creating an environment of stable prices  and that is what this interest rate move is contributing to  is the best support that monetary policy can give to economic growth and growth of employment  wherever in germany italy the netherlands or ireland
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Negative;0.7870775461196899;the level of interest rates at which we are means  to restate what i said previously  interest rates at a historically low level and certainly below a level which can be regarded as more or less neutral in an environment of sustained economic growth
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Positive;0.8889668583869934;we certainly think that rather than inhibiting growth this will help growth
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9909979104995728;the stabilityoriented environment in itself is a great support for a gradual real recovery in all areas of the euro area
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8775609135627747;question mr president given that you feel unable to say this is it which seemed the last time you changed interest rates to emphasise or to stress the durability of the interest rate
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8010825514793396;can one understand that you feel less emphatic about this rate so that we cant expect it to endure as long as the last one
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9657553434371948;duisenberg you cant understand anything because  let me phrase it this way  in our deliberations we were very sure that had we moved by 25 basis points we would immediately have created the expectation and speculation in the markets that there would be another step to follow
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.7785648703575134;that is precisely a phenomenon which we did not want
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9457349181175232;we want to calm down markets and market expectations without saying anything about whether and when a next step might be necessary
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9204840660095215;question coming back to the famous words that is it which gives much room for interpretation could one interpret todays decision as the end of the trend or the change of the trend from interest rates coming down to interest rates going up
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9199751019477844;duisenberg looking at the facts you certainly can interpret it that way and i mean  in april we had lowered interest rates in december already last year we had in a coordinated way lowered interest rates  now we are raising them
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Negative;0.5580665469169617;so there is a reversal of measures because there is a reversal in economic conditions and indicators which we perceived
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9507246613502502;question and secondly id like to ask you whether you could give us an estimate for a foreseeable future for dollareuro exchange rate
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.7811035513877869;duisenberg no i cannot
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9040837287902832;question mr president i want to make sure that we leave this room being very sure
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9228109121322632;we understand exactly what youre saying about the future
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.7537317276000977;you have said that you were trying to remove the stimulus that you put in april
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.624610424041748;duisenberg no
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9639419913291931;question do you now consider yourself the risks after this move evenly balanced
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9322263598442078;duisenberg what i said is that we have come to the conclusion that there is ample liquidity i could add very ample liquidity available in the euro area economy
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Negative;0.7209901809692383;what we want to do is to prevent the liquidity situation from becoming so ample that over time  and the lags are very long as you know in monetary policy and monetary analysis  that over time this ample availability of liquidity would by itself exert an upward pressure on prices
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.91130530834198;and that is all i have said and that is what i must insist on continuing to say
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.7600699663162231;question could you tell us whether the council was entirely in agreement on doing 50 basis points or whether there was some disagreement
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9738785624504089;duisenberg todays decision was a decision taken by consensus
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.6128557920455933;is that enough
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9117610454559326;question and does that mean that no one objected
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8843303322792053;duisenberg it does
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Negative;0.8158083558082581;question in the united states you have seen a quite high growth rate which doesnt create growing inflation
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.6662739515304565;do you think we are going to see the same tendency in europe that we can have a higher growth rate than we recently expected without increasing inflation
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.922955334186554;duisenberg not by copying the united states
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9292001724243164;if we were able to quickly enforce the so badly needed structural changes as i said in labour markets in goods markets in all kinds of activity in the economic sphere then we could come to a higher potential growth rate than we are actually seeing now
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.919255793094635;but that is the first thing that is necessary
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8920217156410217;in other words what is so much talked about namely whether or not the united states has entered into a socalled new economy i dont think that that moment has yet arrived at all in europe
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9608230590820312;we first have to get our own house and that is our labour house our product market house in order before we can start thinking about phenomena which are so benevolent in the united states
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.6018736958503723;question mr president i wanted to check that you still hold the view that consumer price inflation will stay below 2
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Negative;0.6084632277488708;i think you said not long ago that by the end of the year 2000 the level would still be below 2
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Negative;0.8004823923110962;if you still hold this view and given that core inflation remains very subdued it is hard for anyone to see quite where the threats to price stability are really coming from
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9541898369789124;so i wanted it to be spelt out exactly where they are
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9551516771316528;duisenberg the forecasts by all institutions that we have available including our own internal forecasts in as far as we have them point to an inflation rate which on average in the year 2000  on average i say  will remain safely below 2
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.6910738348960876;however all indicators as we assessed them today  and i am talking about wage demands i am talking about producer prices and i am talking about the liquidity situation  point in a direction that the risks on the upside are increasing and have already increased ie
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9392489194869995;the risk of that figure of 1½ to 1½ being threatened
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9825569987297058;and it is precisely for that reason  since we want to keep inflation over the medium term well below the 2 figure that we have set for ourselves as being compatible with price stability  it is precisely for that reason that we have taken the decision of today
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9217451214790344;question translation mr president can you say whether todays decision was taken primarily with a view backwards or forwards
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8400920629501343;have you found that the rate cut of april was too marked so that monetary expansion was encouraged or  if we look forwards and say that the rate of inflation will remain below 2 in the year 2000  that the decision was so to speak the return to a monetary policy strategy
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9797303676605225;only in that case can the interest rate decision be understood both in principle and in economic terms
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.6374453902244568;duisenbergwe remain forwardlooking
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9267649054527283;that is our duty
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9734601378440857;that is also the basis for the decisions taken today
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9896318912506104;and we have considered this decision in the light of the two broad pillars in our monetary policy strategy ie
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9834076762199402;both from the angle of monetary developments and from the assessment of a very wide range of indicators for the future in as far as we had them available
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9346058368682861;so it is by no means a change in strategy nor a change in tactics that underlies our decision
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.6390677094459534;question two questions
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8573777675628662;number one y2k the famous word did it in any way affect your decision hurry up your decision today or was it not an issue at all
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9729920625686646;duisenberg it was not an issue but it was one of the factors taken into consideration  codetermining if i may put it that way the size of the rate increase
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.856563150882721;question and the second question the current level of eurodollar  did that in any way influence todays decision or was that not an issue at all
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.7805011868476868;duisenberg it was no issue at all
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.5317550897598267;question to what extent has the decision been influenced by inflation overshooting over 2 on the periphery in euroland
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9779466390609741;duisenberg in some countries i believe four current inflation rates are over 2
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9348254203796387;that is in ireland portugal the netherlands and spain
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9837861657142639;however current inflation rates are not a determinant of our decisions on interest rates at any time
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9517604112625122;we have a forwardlooking strategy and we stick to that
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.983607292175293;i would also like to repeat once again that the inflation differentials as they exist today in the euro area are by no means exceptional or anything special
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9666967988014221;for that i would like to refer to the article in our last monthly bulletin which explicitly analysed this phenomenon and which also came to the conclusion that the regional differentials in inflation rates in europe as they are today are even smaller than they are  also today  in that other big monetary area the united states
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9602701663970947;question you have said that you want the ecb to be predictable but you think there is a danger that the decisionmaking process was too transparent in this case giving the impression that the rate decision was effectively taken in advance of todays meeting
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Negative;0.6249122023582458;could such an impression undermine the setting of monetary policy  even if it was just an impression
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8900811672210693;duisenberg even if it was just an impression i do not think it will undermine the setting of monetary policy
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9587454795837402;it is very difficult to prevent market expectations from developing in the way as they have done over the past two or three weeks
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8191929459571838;that is admittedly true
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9756576418876648;but we deliberately changed the tone of our assessment and of its presentation starting on 15 july in a press conference with all of you present
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9842967391014099;we did that deliberately on 15 july and we have continued to stick to those indications throughout the period up to the present
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9563407301902771;it sometimes happens in practice that in the repetition it may seem as if there is an acceleration which was not our intention but you cannot do anything about that
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9526144862174988;but then i want to repeat  we do want to be predictable to the maximum extent possible because only in this way can we also succeed in being credible on the markets
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9599758386611938;question mr duisenberg it is related but not exactly the same topic
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9655238389968872;the ecb is meeting next week with the 12 central banks of eastern europe
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9294507503509521;can you tell us something about what you are going to tell them
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9770136475563049;you also have an internal report i guess produced on this obviously in advance of that meeting
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9656695127487183;will you be releasing it to the public
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9742622971534729;and the third aspect what will you tell perhaps candidate countries for accession to the eu who might want to unilaterally adopt the euro for instance in order to improve their inflation prospects and their changes of coming into the eu
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9640951156616211;duisenberg next week friday we have a seminar for the accession countries in helsinki organised by the ecb in cooperation with the central banks of finland and austria
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.977594792842865;and all governors of the accession countries  with the exception of one i believe  will come to that seminar and we will discuss a wide range of issues which have to do with legal aspects statistical aspects monetary policy aspects of entry to or becoming a member of the eu
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9810907244682312;and in this case because the negotiations that are going on with these countries will not result in any country having the socalled optout clause as the united kingdom and denmark had when they were already members accession to the eu inevitably means that over time there will also have to be accession to the european exchange rate mechanism
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9882875084877014;and maybe later it also means that it will end in the adoption of the euro as a currency for these countries
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9538355469703674;but for all these aspects we will have this seminar to exchange information and to increase our visibility and transparency visàvis our colleagues at the central banks in those countries
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9322561621665955;by the way there will be a press conference after the seminar in helsinki
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9884061813354492;your hypothetical question relating to countries which want unilaterally to adopt the euro as their currency be it in the form of a currency board or euroisation of the country we will watch closely whether that would have any monetary policy complications or implications for the euro area
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9817277193069458;if so we would certainly get in touch with the countries concerned to consider whether and how they should take such a move
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Negative;0.6954932808876038;but so far the countries that have indicated that they are thinking of moving in that direction seem not to be an overwhelmingly disturbing factor for the euro area as a whole let me put it this way
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8258394002914429;question translation my question is addressed to christian noyer since we have just had halloween do you have the impression that public opinion will think that central bankers have seen a ghost  a ghost which only they can see  which is the return  still a long way off if i have understood properly of course  of inflation
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9700503945350647;how can you convey a clear message to the public without using the dread term m3
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9483417272567749;noyer sorry to disappoint you but im only going to repeat what the president has already said
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Positive;0.6442832946777344;first weve been trying  since 15 july actually  to explain to the public in advance that our assessments of past or current developments in all the indicators available to us  or which we said right from the start were the reference points of our strategy  be they monetary indicators for the first pillar or indicators both of the real economy and the financial economy for the second pillar  were showing a very clear development
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.4955443739891052;we have tried to explain in advance to the public that it would not be our desire to put a stop to growth at the very moment it was beginning to pick up but to make sure that this growth could remain noninflationary and hence would have the best chance of lasting a long time
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9841110706329346;and thats our aim that growth should pick up in europe  growth is at different stages in different regions but almost everywhere it is picking up  and at a favourable pace which does not generate inflationary tensions because if that were to happen we should be obliged to take measures to curb it later on
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9548644423484802;we want instead that growth should be sound without inflationary tensions so that it will last as long as possible and be as strong as possible
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9354521036148071;in other words todays movement in interest rates is the ecbs contribution to the maintenance and the development of growth which is strong and lasting because it is noninflationary
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9872910380363464;this being said this is not the only condition for growth to remain strong over the long term and to have a powerful employment creation effect
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9695353507995605;just as a last word if i may repeat our leitmotiv because in our view it is absolutely crucial provided a number of structural reforms are carried out or pursued in europe inter alia in terms of goods services and labour markets europes growth potential will be maximised and the employment benefits of growth will also be maximised
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9851865172386169;so that if we want to see unemployment continue to fall  even fall faster  in europe we believe we are contributing to this end by our decision today which supports longterm strong growth which avoids the danger of inflationary developments  although this is not a substitute for the carryingout or pursuit of structural reforms
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9657081961631775;question mr duisenberg you are expressing the consistency of your communication by saying that in july already you had changed your tone
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9224322438240051;which is true
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8680934309959412;m3 growth rate was a little above 5 at the time and you had said that this is not so worrying yet but you might change your assessment if it would grow further
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.909843921661377;but at the next press conference in september the last available value had indeed risen further and you said at that time that you had not changed your assessment since
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9231541752815247;you said that m3 growth was not so reliable at this point because of the changeover and special effects and all that
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9219496846199036;and only at the october press conference you had changed the tone again
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Negative;0.8671500086784363;and this is not the only inconsistency
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.96229088306427;you lowered interest rates when m3 was above 5 in april and it has been above 5 almost all of the time and you had very different tones
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9750601053237915;so we are left with the impression that it does not matter so much where it is at the moment but what matters is what you want to say and what conclusion you come to by other indicators and by your considerations and you just use your assessment of m3 as a channel to communicate
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.881682276725769;but that it is not coming from m3 but you just pack it onto m3 and that makes you a little unpredictable and it requires you in advance to say what you are going to do because otherwise we would not know
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.7515637278556824;duisenberg well that last conclusion i would not share with you
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8831737637519836;what i simply said in the past and what i said today is that we needed more evidence and we now can conclude that month after month after month the monetary aggregates have been moving further away from what we have called our reference value
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9714373350143433;that can vary from one month to another of course
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8532622456550598;but you need an adequately long period in which you can come to that conclusion
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9670729041099548;then at the same time we are not looking only at the monetary aggregates
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9749020338058472;no we have deliberately adopted a twopillar strategy in which we look at a broad range of other indicators  and i have mentioned quite a few to you today  which also determines our attitude together with the assessment of monetary developments
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.4656906723976135;to my mind we were and we are very predictable
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.7081420421600342;the major difference between let us say the underlying situation in april and that of today was that in april we had two pillars so to speak pointing in different directions which made the situation more difficult to both interpret and to act upon
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Negative;0.6910642385482788;today we have both pillars suddenly pointing in the same direction namely in the direction of an increased risk towards price stability as we perceive it
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.7772153615951538;questioni am very curious on how you come to your final conclusion
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9824753999710083;i mean after having analysed all the facts and figures of pillar one and pillar two i imagine that you must resort to a kind of quantitative feeling or use intuition in some way to come to this decision if i am correct
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.7770434021949768;how do you do that
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.533695638179779;duisenberg that is very difficult to describe
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9393898844718933;it is a process
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9518835544586182;it is not just one decision or at one moment that you come to such a conclusion  certainly not as we did today collectively
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9687982201576233;but every individual member of the council has over the past few weeks some even over the past few months been busy with himself and others thinking about how do we interpret the current developments
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9419161081314087;and then finally we come together on a day like this
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.5003203749656677;but it has been prepared very well in small circles
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9898715615272522;of course we in the executive board have also discussed it earlier this week and we all came to our individual assessments
1999-11-04;1999;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9640490412712097;and then finally you come together on a morning like today and you confront each other with your thoughts and the outcome of your thinking over the past period and then it finally comes out that this is the decision we want to take on the proposal one of us had made
