1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9849593043327332;let me first report that the governing council decided to confirm the reference value for monetary growth namely an annual growth rate of 4½ for the broad aggregate m3
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9865676164627075;this decision was taken on the grounds that the components underlying the derivation of the first reference value in december 1998 namely the eurosystems definition of price stability and the assumptions for trend real gdp growth and the trend decline in m3 income velocity have remained unchanged
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9927041530609131;as before the governing council will assess monetary developments in relation to the reference value on the basis of a threemonth moving average of annual growth rates
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9016345739364624;the governing council has decided henceforth to review the reference value on a regular annual basis with the next review to take place in december 2000 against this background the governing council wishes to emphasise that the trend growth potential of the euro area could be considerably enhanced by structural reform in the labour and goods markets
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9906508922576904;the eurosystems monetary policy strategy would take such changes into account as appropriate
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9837835431098938;the derivation of the reference value of 4½ is an expression of a mediumtermoriented approach
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.6119781136512756;the generous liquidity situation in 1999 will have to be borne in mind
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9752846956253052;the ecb will issue a press release today providing some background information on the review of the reference value carried out today by the governing council
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9843648076057434;the press release will also recall the role of the reference value within the eurosystems monetary policy strategy
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.981351912021637;the governing council also conducted its regular review of the outlook for price developments and the risks to price stability in the euro area this time including a review of the most recent forecasts and projections
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9829779267311096;after this examination the interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the eurosystem was left at 30 and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and on the deposit facility were maintained at 40 and 20 respectively
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9732819199562073;allow me to outline the main elements of our assessment of the latest information on monetary financial market and other economic developments
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Positive;0.5537561774253845;with regard to monetary developments in the euro area the data up to october 1999  which still refer to the period before our decision to raise interest rates  confirmed the picture of a generous liquidity situation in the euro area
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9744633436203003;the annual growth rate of m3 in october 1999 was 60
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9663985371589661;this compares with 62 in the previous month
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9889814853668213;the threemonth average of the annual growth rates of m3 covering the period from august to october 1999 was unchanged at 60 and thus stood 1½ percentage points above the reference value of 4½
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Negative;0.43802013993263245;the growth of the most liquid components of m3 remained very dynamic
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.8747609853744507;in addition the annual growth rate of credit to the private sector continued to exceed 10
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Positive;0.8296971321105957;as we have noted on previous occasions these monetary and credit developments are considered to have been driven mainly by the low level of interest rates as well as by the pickup in economic activity in the euro area
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.6396790146827698;the initial reaction of euro area financial markets to the eurosystems monetary policy move of last month was favourable
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Negative;0.9941487312316895;in particular this was signalled by the continued decline in longterm government bond yields and the immediate substantial reduction in market uncertainty regarding the evolution of future longterm interest rates
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Negative;0.9644724130630493;later in november longterm bond yields in the euro area began to rise again gradually in connection with developments in international bond markets and favourable expectations for world growth
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9695232510566711;indeed the global economic outlook remains positive and the view that the world economy is set for higher growth appears to be shared by the major international organisations
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.6363512277603149;at the same time the expectation that growth differentials between the main economic regions will narrow in the course of time is widespread
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9785844683647156;while real gdp growth in the united states is generally expected to ease it is expected to accelerate in the euro area
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Positive;0.6886343955993652;overall relatively wide growth differentials between the major world economies will give way to a more balanced scenario thereby underlining the potential for the euro to appreciate
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9888759255409241;with regard to developments in economic activity in the euro area the latest data confirm a strengthening of growth in the course of the second half of 1999 in particular production growth in the industrial sector saw a further upturn in the third quarter and various survey data suggest that this will continue in the final quarter
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9886487126350403;all available projections indicate that this upward momentum will lead to an acceleration in real gdp growth from around 2 this year to close to 3 in both 2000 and 2001 consumer price increases as measured by the harmonised index of consumer prices hicp have recently resumed their upward trend as expected
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9238026142120361;in october the annual rate of change in the overall hicp was 14 up from 12 in september and august owing to higher price increases for food and nonenergy industrial goods
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Positive;0.46744728088378906;the impact of higher oil prices on energy prices in the hicp which had accounted for most of the upward pressure since june 1999 was countered in october by more moderate increases in other energy components
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Negative;0.9701026082038879;some additional counterweight to the upward movement in goods prices came from a further moderation of increases in prices in the services sector
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9383624196052551;in general the overall upward trend is expected to continue until early 2000 as a result of the increase in oil prices since spring 1999 forecasts available suggest that price increases will nevertheless remain below 2 in the course of 2000 and 2001 however the actual developments will very much depend on the behaviour of a number of factors and in particular on wage developments remaining in line with price stability
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9513680934906006;in addition our assessment has to take due account of prevailing uncertainties
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9822999835014343;on the upside these relate to inter alia the behaviour of money and credit aggregates the developments in oil prices and the path of the effective exchange rate all of which are closely monitored with regard to their impact on price stability
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Negative;0.8734409213066101;on the downside main factors are linked to the effects of deregulation and liberalisation
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9833992719650269;in conclusion the current monetary policy stance should ensure a sustainable expansion of noninflationary economic activity in the euro area
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9721152186393738;in line with its monetary policy strategy the governing council will remain vigilant with regard to any risks to price stability arising either from domestic or from external sources and act in a timely manner
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9343233108520508;let me now give the floor to the vicepresident to introduce some of the additional topics we discussed during our meetings
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.976862907409668;the governing council today also took a decision on the subject of the minimum reserve system
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9372317790985107;as you may be aware interbank liabilities are not subject to reserve requirements
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9907917976379395;in this respect the ecb allows those credit institutions which cannot provide evidence of their interbank liabilities  in the form of debt securities issued with an agreed maturity of up to two years or money market paper  to apply a standardised deduction to the aforementioned liabilities in the computation of their reserve base
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9914789795875549;since january 1999 this standardised deduction has been set at 10 for both types of securities
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9775151610374451;today following a review of new statistical evidence available the governing council decided to increase the standardised deduction to 30
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9730992317199707;this decision shall have effect as from the determination of the reserve requirement to be fulfilled in the maintenance period starting on 24 january 2000 a separate press release presenting this decision and some background information on standardised deductions from the reserve base will be issued to you here today
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9804174900054932;the governing council today approved the ecbs budget for 2000 which gives the ecb the green light to recruit further staff needed to support the ongoing activities of the ecb
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9881929755210876;this will bring the ecbs staff to slightly over 1000 the number of staff employed to date stands at 750 at its meeting on 18 november 1999 the governing council approved the publication of an update of the book on european union balance of payments statistical methods the bop
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.869545578956604;book
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Positive;0.709028959274292;this important book documents the statistical methodologies applied in member states in compiling balance of payments statistics and as such improves the transparency of the compilation of euro area statistics
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.986729085445404;this new version includes additional chapters on i investment income ii estimation methods especially for goods investment income and portfolio investment iii financial derivatives and iv the stocks compiled for international investment position statistics
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9291024804115295;the book was published on the ecbs web site at 4 pm yesterday and will be available from the ecb in hard copy format during the course of next week
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9881250858306885;finally let me inform you that the general council discussed the monetary policy objectives strategies and intentions of the nonparticipating eu central banks against the background set by the monetary policy of the eurosystem
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9848371148109436;this is the second time that such an exercise has been undertaken since the ecb was established
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9318070411682129;we are now at your disposal should you have any questions
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9261495471000671;transcript of the questions asked and the answers given by dr willem f duisenberg president of the ecb and christian noyer vicepresident of the ecb question did you  in reviewing the reference value for m3  also discuss the possibility of introducing a corridor around the reference value that  as some economists argue  could have helped to stabilise expectations
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.977959930896759;duisenberg we did discuss this internally in the ecb as it should be before coming to our proposal and we decided to stick to our original decision of basing our strategy  at least one pillar  on a comparison with a reference value and not a corridor
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.8993733525276184;this was not discussed
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Negative;0.9133301973342896;question could i ask you obviously the euro does have a bit of an image problem and is not proving attractive to investors today
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.5123249292373657;is there anything you think you could do to improve that image to make it clear that the euro is a better currency than it looks today
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9466387629508972;duisenberg yes i think so  to continue to pursue a policy that is oriented to price stability in the euro area and with success i might say
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9839118123054504;we do believe  if we get that message across and we will continue to do so  that that in itself will underline as i have already said our feeling that the euro has a strong potential to appreciate
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.4902776777744293;question mr duisenberg in an ft article of last week you made a very pointed statement about potential and trend growth
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9077692031860352;you said that there was perhaps a good case that the potential growth has risen or the rate of potential growth has risen and is not necessarily reflecting the trend of the last two decades
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9574259519577026;that is precisely  as far as i can get it  what you said
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9237328171730042;my question is can you tell us more about the discussion of potential growth and how long it was actually discussed in the governing council
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.7120533585548401;and the other thing is did the fact of the approach to eurodollar parity which seems to be happening in the financial markets have any bearing on that
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.8551930785179138;in other words would the discussion have been different if the euro had been a lot stronger in the financial markets
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.7598667144775391;duisenberg on potential growth if i remember what i said and was reported correctly i did not say that the potential growth was higher but that it could be higher and could become higher than the trend rate of growth which we observe which we put at the figure of 2 to 2½ for the euro area as a whole
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9176145195960999;if indeed the structural reforms in the labour market in the good markets were finally to be implemented throughout the euro area then we could have a potential growth rate or a growth rate that is significantly higher than that currently perceived
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Negative;0.5773952007293701;but i did not say that it has already happened
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.7946467399597168;the second question on approaching parity was not discussed very thoroughly
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9465063810348511;as you may know we do not have an exchange rate target
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9825908541679382;on the one hand the exchange rate is regarded as the outcome of the entire economic process and  may i add  the psychological process on both sides of the atlantic
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9799153804779053;we are still faced with the phenomenon that we have a remarkable continued high rate of growth in the united states and only a just recovering but accelerating rate of growth in europe
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.8561602830886841;that phenomenon by itself is what makes the exchange rate movements  let me call it  not inexplicable
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9892330169677734;moreover these movements as i said earlier underline our strong belief as the rates of growth converge on each other that the euro has a strong potential to appreciate
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9372203946113586;and the forecasts we have available  also the commission forecast published last week  say that in two years time the rate of growth in europe is expected to exceed the rate of growth in the united states
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9361166954040527;question translation on the exchange rate the eurodollar exchange rate one has the impression that whatever you say whatever you do the euro has continued to slide against the dollar
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.539651095867157;so is it a problem of communication is it the markets who have a problem visàvis the euro
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.704119086265564;the second question is this depreciation of the euro against the dollar  is it not a piece of good news
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Negative;0.8652730584144592;because some people seem to be thinking that it is a disaster
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.4893937408924103;could it not be said that it is very positive for the european economy and can it not contribute to the recovery of economic growth in the euro area
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.717218279838562;duisenberg well you correctly said that  whatever i say or whatever i do  the euro continues its movement
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9102231860160828;so i am perhaps best advised to stop saying anything although for once you have not exaggerated
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9878401160240173;the movements that the exchange rate has shown over the past six months have a twosided effect
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9563797116279602;on the one hand they have increased the import price level in the euro area
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9795919060707092;so that has an upward impact albeit a small one on future inflation rates
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.5228527188301086;on the other hand it is undeniable that it makes it easier for our exporters to compete in world markets
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Negative;0.7667362093925476;question mr duisenberg are you worried about all the negative comments in the press on the euro
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.7222664952278137;and what might the motives behind that be
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.8546146750450134;duisenberg what might the motives be
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.8373313546180725;i am an economist and not a psychologist
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9413253664970398;well let me say what i say ever more often as a central banker the one thing i have learnt is not to speculate on anything but rather to fight speculation wherever i can
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.738064706325531;so i will refrain from any speculation  also on this aspect
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.6399989724159241;question mr president do you see any signs that the growth of m3 could slow down a little bit in the foreseeable future and could you elaborate a little more on why you left your reference point at 45
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9173413515090942;duisenberg we do not yet see signs of a slowing down although we expect it over time  but the lags are long as you know  to do so as a result of our increase in interest rates last month
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.6170724630355835;that might  but it will take time for it to materialise  lead to a smaller growth of m3 in the future
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.992521345615387;the decision to leave the reference value unchanged was based on the consideration that the factors underlying this decision the 4½ figure have remained unchanged
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9778209924697876;so they did not give any reason  and i will explain it in a minute  to change the overall figure
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9786946177482605;as you know the 4½ figure for the reference value is based on our measure of what price stability is
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9818099737167358;we define price stability as an increase of 2 or less in consumer prices
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9889332056045532;then it is based on the trend rate of economic growth as we perceive it which  as i have just said  we still estimate at between 2 and 2½ and  as a minor factor  on the trend rate of change in the velocity of circulation of money which is still estimated at between ½ and 1 per year
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9775117635726929;well adding all these figures up you again like last year arrive at a total of around 4½
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.5052976608276367;now what i added today is that if  indeed also in response to the first question  if potential growth were to rise in the course of time and if there were convincing evidence that this was happening as a result of structural reforms in the functioning of the various markets if the potential rate of growth were thus to go higher then that would also be a reason to reconsider our reference value
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.6454338431358337;but it is too early to tell whether or not that will materialise
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.8987428545951843;question mr president at the last press conference you told us about a highlevel seminar on monetary cooperation with the preaccession countries in helsinki
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.8931127786636353;could you tell us whether some progress has been made or what has been decided or discussed
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.6784106492996216;duisenberg it was what we regard as a highly successful conference
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9890546798706055;it was attended by all central banks and in 11 out of 12 cases by the governors of the central banks of the accession countries both the countries that are actually already negotiating and countries that are on the verge of starting negotiations
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9769337773323059;but it did not only cover cooperation on monetary policy
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9806973934173584;it covered a broad range of areas in order to make these central banks familiar with concepts such as the legal framework required for not only the central banks but also the banking system and the financial markets with the necessity to change  on accession  the legislation and infrastructure in their countries with the thought that accession would have implications for their currency regimes which are now very diverse in the various countries
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.8586846590042114;i would judge it to have been a very successful conference which will form the basis for increased and intensified bilateral contacts as well as for more specialised multilateral contacts in the various areas of central banking let me call it that way
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9537739753723145;and the next such conference an allencompassing conference will take place next year in vienna again under the sponsorship of the european central bank and in that case the national bank of austria
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9543974995613098;question mr president excuse me if i return to the exchange rate
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Negative;0.8195497393608093;but from what you have been saying did i understand you correctly that you would not worry much if the euro were to go far below parity
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9116030931472778;that is my first question
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Negative;0.509581983089447;my second question is the low level of the euro that the low exchange rate level decreases the effect of the interest rate increase last month
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.8169814348220825;so we could argue that you have to increase the interest rates again because the exchange rate level is too low
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.8071708083152771;could that be possible
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9683966040611267;duisenberg the exchange rate  and i can apparently not repeat it often enough  is one of the main indicators forming part of the second pillar of our monetary policy strategy
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9755815267562866;so it will be watched closely
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9705386161804199;by itself it will not trigger a monetary policy reaction
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9900031089782715;a monetary policy reaction will always be based on an analysis of the two pillars of the strategy
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9144555330276489;and whether or not i am concerned is not so relevant
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Negative;0.986628532409668;i would become concerned if our strong belief  the potential for an appreciation of the euro the future strength of the euro  were not to materialise over time
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.8217875361442566;but these things always take time
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.5032899975776672;question translation mr president i have a question on the review of the reference value for m3 in the event of a stronger growth potential
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9648838043212891;the stronger growth potential in the case of productivity advances would clearly also mean that the upward movement of prices is not developing as had initially been expected  viz
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.863794207572937;the united states
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9355021119117737;this means that a higher growth potential does not necessarily demand an increase in the reference value for m3
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9493653178215027;my second question you have given the forecast or anticipated growth rate as 3 in the forthcoming year and in the year after that or as just under 3 and the rate of inflation as below 2
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9761176705360413;is this a first attempt at publishing ecb forecasts
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.7376484274864197;duisenberg the first question i did not understand
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.987431526184082;as to the second question indeed when we make judgements about the forecasts of others we also  for the time being internally  compare them with those of the european commission the oecd the imf and our regular survey of forecasting institutions
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9820348024368286;we of course also compare those forecasts with our internal preliminary forecasts which will ultimately be published in the course of next year as i have often announced
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9607293009757996;but what is striking so far is that all the forecasts i have mentioned both the external and the internal are strikingly similar in their outcome
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9876893758773804;so for example the forecasts that were published by the european commission although the underlying assumptions were sometimes slightly different from ours their outcome was virtually identical
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.8907385468482971;so i would point out that the european commission also forecasts average inflation in 2000 and 2001 to be 15 and we see no reason to deviate from that forecast
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9138500690460205;question mr duisenberg financial markets are betting that interest rates will be 15 percentage points higher again by the end of next year
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9714623093605042;the oecd on the other hand says there will be no change
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Negative;0.8640434145927429;do you think that the financial markets might be exaggerating
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.8970045447349548;duisenberg would you excuse me that i will not join in the speculation on interest rates for the future
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9100778698921204;so i will not give a judgement on that
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.7205667495727539;question i have two questions
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Negative;0.5042924880981445;is your monetary policy still far too accommodative as some operators say
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.8166685700416565;and then i have a question to the euro depreciation
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9016067981719971;how much importance do you attach in respect of the euro depreciation to the intervention in germany of the chancellor to save an almost bankrupt company or to the importance of hidden parallel accounts for the biggest german party which was in government here in germany for sixteen years
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.8869359493255615;duisenberg given the fact that our monetary analysis and our monetary policy stance allows for an expected price development of less than 2 over the next two years ie
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Negative;0.6442617774009705;over the mediumterm i do not share your hypothesis that our monetary policy would be far too accommodative
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9766013622283936;it would only be so if price developments would happen to exceed our limit of 2 in the medium run
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.584979772567749;all i want to say about the recent intervention in germany  in the company market may we call it like that  is that it does not enhance the image which we want to have of being an increasingly marketdriven economy across the euro area
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.851841390132904;question a couple of notes again on m3 if you do not mind
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9505056738853455;i was going to ask you first of all about the timing of the next review
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9037628769874573;what is your gut feeling about whether it will be a full year before you look at m3 again or might you have a look at m3 a little bit earlier on next year
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.8981474041938782;the other thing is about the reliability of m3
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.7172425389289856;duisenberg on the first one i can be very quick
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.956709086894989;our expectation is  as announced  that we will have the next review of the reference value for m3 in december 2000 question so you definitely will not look at it before that
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.7475576996803284;duisenberg not definitely but not likely
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.8898734450340271;question and the second point was on the reliability of m3
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.5146185159683228;do you see m3 as getting more reliable
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.7499921321868896;we thought about y2k effects and so on
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9781025052070618;when will it be before we can make some firm conclusions about the relationship between m3 and the price level
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9848271608352661;duisenberg our studies as published in a working paper two months ago already indicate that we perceive a very stable relationship in the money demand function in the relationship between m3 and prices over the medium term
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.820258617401123;and the figures as our statisticians have assured us are becoming more reliable almost by the day
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.8483033776283264;but we do of course have this y2k effect which may cause some hickups in the development of the figures
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9370437860488892;question mr duisenberg i would like to know if the ecb is prepared in principle to intervene in the market in coordination with the fed and the bank of japan
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9658709168434143;duisenberg on interventions all i can say is that as you know we have the instrument available
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9150440692901611;as to whenever and wherever and how we are going to use it i will not speculate
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.7355103492736816;question i would like to come back to that question of the german governments intervention in the holzmann case
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.8797347545623779;you made it fairly clear that you thought it was not compatible with the marketdriven economy we would like to see in the euro area
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Negative;0.5119255185127258;but what do you say to the public comments of the german government this is the way we do things in germany we are an elected government and we feel we have the right to form our economic policy  in other words it is their concern not that of the european central bank
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.8236715793609619;duisenberg no but i was only referring to the fallout to what impression of the european economy these actions have given and give i think
1999-12-02;1999;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9529099464416504;and whatever i may say to the german government i would rather say to the german government directly
