1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9636868834495544;let me start with the governing councils discussion on recent economic developments and the decisions that the governing council has taken today in the field of monetary policy
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9813281297683716;after a comprehensive and careful examination of recent trends and ongoing evaluations of the economic outlook for the euro area economy there was consensus that some of the risks identified earlier in particular with regard to real gdp growth had materialised in the fourth quarter of 1998 there was also consensus that the impact of these developments on the balance of risks for price stability would need to be examined further in the context of the monetary policy strategy adopted by the eurosystem
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9055994749069214;at this juncture taking into account all the information available the governing council confirmed its earlier assessment of the outlook for price stability
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9890069961547852;against this background it decided that for the main refinancing operations to be settled on 10 and 17 march 1999 the same conditions will apply as for the previous one ie
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9672382473945618;they will be fixed rate tenders conducted at an interest rate of 30
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9812476634979248;in addition the interest rate on the marginal lending facility will continue to be 45 and the interest rate on the deposit facility will remain 20
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9826521873474121;let me report in some more detail on the governing councils deliberations and thereby provide explanations for the decisions we took today
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.7442344427108765;starting with the monetary developments in the euro area at the start of stage three of emu the broad monetary aggregate m3 expanded at an annual rate of 57 in january 1999 against 45 in december 1998 this upturn was largely due to an acceleration in overnight deposits
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9891133308410645;this in turn may be explained by the low level of interest rates which also contributed to credit to the private sector to accelerate further in january 1999 to 94 which is particularly notable as other indicators of the economy are signalling a slowdown in activity
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Negative;0.5107629299163818;monthly data on monetary aggregates can be volatile
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9662874341011047;m3 growth is therefore monitored on the basis of threemonth moving averages of the 12month growth rate of m3 which stood at 49 in the period from november 1998 to january 1999 this was 02 percentage point higher than the figure recorded in the previous threemonth period and is 04 percentage point above the reference value of 4½
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9633601903915405;against this background and in view of the uncertainty relating to special factors pertaining to the changeover to the stage three environment and the introduction of the euro the governing council does not consider the acceleration of m3 at the start of stage three as a signal of future inflationary pressures
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9656764268875122;however a close monitoring of monetary developments in the coming months remain necessary to give more conclusive evidence of the underlying causes and the permanent or temporary nature of the rise in m3 growth
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Negative;0.879462718963623;turning to financial indicators euro area capital markets underwent a correction in february which was mainly linked to spillovers from the united states and japan
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9905980229377747;this followed a decline in longterm interest rates in january which had brought bond yields in the euro area to the lowest levels seen since the late 1940s
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9899252653121948;the euro area yield curve shifted upwards across the entire maturity spectrum during february
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9870495200157166;let me also recall that the nominal effective exchange rate of the euro area in early march stood around 1 below its level on 1 february and around 4 below its starting level on 4 january 1999 at the same time recent developments appear to have led to a reduction in some of the uncertainties surrounding the evolution of the world economy in 1999 this mainly relates to the strong performance of the us economy but may also be due to signs of improvement in the real economies of some asian
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.5988460779190063;nevertheless in the view of the governing council it is too early at present for a truly favourable assessment of the external environment for the euro area
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.5826296806335449;risks pertaining to external imbalances continuing risk aversion and the corresponding weakness of private longterm capital flows and real investment to emerging market economies will need to be examined closely
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9888050556182861;in the euro area the latest indicators confirm that those risks which were identified earlier have now materialised to some extent
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9931504130363464;according to preliminary and incomplete data from national sources real gdp growth in the euro area weakened in the fourth quarter of 1998 when compared with the previous quarter
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Negative;0.995297372341156;while more precise estimates will soon become available from eurostat the evidence available suggests that activity in the euro area has been slowing down in recent months
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9782462120056152;this is particularly apparent in the production of themanufacturing sector where output in the fourth quarter of 1998 fell by almost 1 compared with the previous quarter
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9007875919342041;these developments broadly confirm the pattern observed earlier in industrial confidence which was on a declining trend in the second half of 1998 the latest data on industrial confidence in the euro area ie
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9947754144668579;those released by the european commission today indicate that industrial confidence has weakened further
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Negative;0.5548672676086426;some recent wage developments in the euro area might have contributed to that
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9566457867622375;the level of unemployment has remained more or less unchanged over the past four months
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9412323236465454;finally consumer confidence in the euro area has remained unchanged from the high levels seen at the beginning of the year
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9436575770378113;with regard to capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector which fell further in the fourth quarter of 1998 and retail sales which up to november 1998 pointed towards broadly sustained growth no new data are yet available
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9905962944030762;overall with regard to the cyclical situation recent data confirm our earlier expectations that there are still downside risks for output growth
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9881293177604675;the governing council will continue its thorough analysis and very close monitoring of underlying trends and review its broad outlook for the euro area accordingly on an ongoing basis taking into account in a forwardlooking manner the impact of both domestic and external developments
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9882742166519165;with regard to the latest data on the harmonised index of consumer prices hicp the annual increase for january 1999 was 08 which is unchanged compared with the previous two months taking account of the most recent revisions
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9539729952812195;looking at a breakdown of the hicp a slight decline in the rate of increase in service prices from 19 in december 1998 to 18 in january 1999 was offset by a slight increase in goods prices from 01 to 02
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9689903855323792;the fall in the rate of change in services prices was mainly due to lower price increases for transport and communications this may have been a reflection of increased competition in these sectors
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9937410950660706;on the other hand downward pressure from energy prices on goods prices diminished somewhat
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9032933712005615;on balance the current data continue to suggest that there are no significant upward or downward pressures on prices in the short term
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9903180599212646;the pattern of risks to price stability has also remained broadly unchanged on balance
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9912694692611694;on the upward side wage developments are a matter of concern as would be any loosening of fiscal policies and the implications of this for achieving the objectives laid down in the stability and growth pact
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9845470786094666;in addition recent exchange rate trends need to be monitored closely also in terms of their impact on prices
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9863643050193787;concerning downward risks in particular the slowdown in the euro area economy is a cause for concern
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9734881520271301;in conclusion taking the latest available evidence into account at todays meeting the governing council confirmed its assessment regarding the outlook for price developments
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9893621802330017;the governing council therefore decided to keep ecb interest rates unchanged at the levels currently prevailing
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9570508599281311;i should now like to inform you about some other matters considered today
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9921315312385559;the auction technique for the longerterm refinancing operations was reviewed by the governing council todayin its first two longerterm refinancing operations settled on 14 january and 25 february 1999 which are as a rule conducted by means of variable rate tenders the eurosystem applied the single rate dutch method of allotment
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9913299083709717;the single rate method was chosen in order to encourage less experienced counterparties to participate in the tender
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9837978482246399;the governing council takes the view that all interested counterparties should by now be sufficiently accustomed to the longerterm refinancing operation also to be in a position to participate in this type of operation under the more marketoriented multiple rate american method of allotment
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9872568845748901;against this background the governing council has decided that the multiple rate method of allotment will be applied starting from the next longerterm refinancing operation to be settled on 25 march 1999 until otherwise indicated
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9897909760475159;finally let me inform you that the general council today discussed the monetary policies of the central banks of the nonparticipating member states against the background of the monetary policy set by the eurosystem
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9025367498397827;as you will know the general council has taken over those tasks of the european monetary institute emi which still have to be performed during stage three because of the derogations of some member states
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9470244646072388;one of these tasks relates to strengthening the coordination of the monetary policies in the community with the aim of ensuring price stability
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9867148995399475;the general council intends to conduct these coordination exercises biannually in future
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9318070411682129;we are now at your disposal should you have any questions
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9264914393424988;transcript of the questions asked and the answers given by dr willem f duisenberg president of the ecb and christian noyer vicepresident of the ecb question translation mr president what in your view are the reasons for the weak euro
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8844701051712036;is it due to the interest rate and business activity differentials visàvis the united states as is argued by some or is it rather due to the political pressure brought to bear on the central bank as argue others
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.823434591293335;duisenberg we think it is predominantly the strength of the us dollar rather than the weakness of the euro which is determining the picture
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9444509744644165;and of course the interest rate differentials may also have something to do with that
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8802829384803772;we think those are the main factors explaining the recent decline in the value of the euro which  if you look at the level which the euro has now reached  i would like to add is more or less the level which the dmark had during most of last year and the strength with which the euro started life was more the exception than the rule
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9351804852485657;question it did not come as a surprise that you did not change interest rates today since you and other board members have sort of said so in the last days
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8739352226257324;you have been pretty clear in what you and mr noyer said
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9577460289001465;was that ok with the other council members did you check that with them
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9092349410057068;duisenberg yeah we checked it today with them and it was ok question translation a young currency requires political support
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9910200238227844;with regard to the interest rate differential could part of the weakness be due to the fact that confidence has not yet been underscored politically to the extent needed
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9303440451622009;duisenberg yes we are doing our utmost to underscore the confidence that the world has in this young form of money the euro and we would certainly hope that not only the ecb but also politics would help us to the maximum extent possible in supporting this confidencebuilding process
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.540418803691864;question translation is the interest rate differential between the united states and europe alone not an indication that calls for a reduction of official interest rates in europe are simply wrong
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8847786784172058;duisenberg i would not place it in that context
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.7729392647743225;but what we are investigating is that there could be another related matter
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Positive;0.955226480960846;namely that the very strong increase in credit to the private sector has partly led or has been used to buy us dollardenominated assets attracted by the higher interest rates to be earned in the united states
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Negative;0.8339923024177551;and that by itself could have lets say financed the weakening of the euro or the strength of the dollar
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Negative;0.4940955936908722;but we are not yet quite sure about that
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9728956818580627;we will have to have more data available on capital flows and on where the credit is going to precisely before we can come to any conclusions
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8803110122680664;but i am happy that you underscore the fact that interest rates in europe are at an extremely low level not only historically but also compared with other major areas in the world
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9355713725090027;that in itself underscores that in the current cyclical situation monetary policy can definitely be regarded as having taken an accommodating stance
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9756805896759033;question are you concerned that the fall in the value of the euro against the pound sterling could create dangers of inflation in some peripheral countries such as ireland that have a very large trade exposure to sterling
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9128291010856628;duisenbergwe do not as yet have any indication whatsoever of that happening
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9820755124092102;of course as i said in my introduction we will closely monitor and keep monitoring the exchange rate developments also with a view to their impact on or the impact they might have on prices particularly through import prices
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8556045293807983;but  although i hate to mention individual countries i do want to point out that irish inflation is also still under 2
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.7607589960098267;question i actually have two questions
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.5303876996040344;the one concerns the economic outlook in the world and especially how would you see the trends right now in russia china and brazil
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9600255489349365;and the other question concerns the sort of a code of conduct for ecb board members
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.986530601978302;the eu commission announced yesterday that it will have a sort of a code of conduct for eu commissioners ie
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9851804971694946;that all the commissioners will have to reveal their economic connections and double salaries etc
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8640757203102112;what about your members
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8491827249526978;duisenberg the first question
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.864837110042572;mr noyer has just returned from the far east
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.5014127492904663;so he has the best insight into world economic developments
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9600955247879028;on the second question i can be very brief our code of conduct is in the treaty
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9860240817070007;it is forbidden for members of the board to have any employment whether paid or unpaid outside their functions as members of the executive board
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9698224067687988;that is what the treaty says
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9585309028625488;but that relates to employment and therefore also to income from any employment
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Negative;0.738803505897522;i know that in the finnish case there has been some particular scrutiny of certain pension rights
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9352439641952515;they fall entirely outside this matter
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.895082950592041;noyeron the other question i am sorry i have no particular new information on china or brazil
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.935086727142334;on brazil there is no new information at least not as far as we know
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.5832952260971069;chinas situation might not be so clear there are some new developments
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.6479210257530212;but what is interesting in asia is really that several countries that were hit by the first wave of difficulties the asean countries are now moving upwards
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9461666941642761;if you take malaysia thailand and south korea for instance they are clearly countries in which reforms are being implemented and their economies seem to be gradually picking up
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.7637131214141846;perhaps this is less clear for other countries
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9729132652282715;it seems that after all there are good signs also coming from these regions and from the emerging economies in general
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Negative;0.8869338631629944;so we still have to wait and see if this is confirmed but there is not only bad news from an international point of view
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9897851347923279;may i also take this opportunity to say that it is clear that in these countries the rate of development in exports to european countries as compared with the development of exports to the united states has been roughly the same over the last two years
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Positive;0.5389143228530884;that is to say that even if the us economy is seen to be more buoyant than that in europe one cannot say that the us economy has in fact helped these countries to recover more than the european economy because the development of exports has been roughly the same over that period
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8074514269828796;with regard to russia i dont think there are new developments that are obvious for the time being
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9620183110237122;they are clearly in the process of discussing with the imf
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9637119770050049;the countries i was speaking of are proving to be in a better shape ie
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9893758296966553;countries that had negotiated a programme with the imf some time ago and that have implemented that programme so that first results of this policy are appearing
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Negative;0.6774554252624512;this is quite satisfactory
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9764503836631775;question what added complexity is there now in the setting of monetary policy of interest rate policy with the suggestion that the german economy shrunk in the last quarter of last year whilst other major economies of other countries such as france such as holland and spain were still growing
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Negative;0.8897589445114136;does this cause complications and additional difficulties in setting interest policy
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Negative;0.8194668889045715;duisenberg well it does make the evaluation and the judgement more difficult undoubtedly because developments in various parts of euroland seem to be diverging somewhat
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9749510884284973;so it causes us to say what is of the least complexity to reach what we have to our euro areawide view on developments
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9881935715675354;question translation the greek minister of finance stated in an interview on sunday that where the rate of inflation in greece is concerned where its accession to monetary union is concerned this criterion might be weakened
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9762845635414124;in that context he referred to both the commission in brussels and the european central bank
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9874353408813477;he implied that these suggestions had come from both institutions
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8584921360015869;is he right
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9561785459518433;duisenberg we have in the context of the general council meeting i have just talked about briefly discussed the issue without even trying to reach any conclusion
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9826139807701111;what is a fact is that in the future when you have to judge a new entrant to the euro zone you will also have to make an assessment as was done in the past on the basis of the convergence criteria enumerated in the treaty
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9856910109519958;now it is a factthat the treaty was very precise in describing the criteria and how they had to be assessed in the first wave
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9866212606430054;the treaty is a little less precise in describing exactly how to interpret the criteria in the case of additional countries joining a then already existing euroland
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8602487444877625;for example this particular greek case for which we have reached no conclusion
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9879775047302246;we will come back to that later on when  i am almost inclined to say when the time is right  when actual access to the euro area is about to be negotiated
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9652314186096191;then we will come back to that
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9899724721908569;but  to mention just one example  one of the criteria was that the inflation rate should not deviate more than 1½ percentage points from the average rate of inflation of the three bestperforming countries
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9759441614151001;now how do you interpret that in future when you have an inflation rate for the euro area as a whole
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9690786004066467;do you then look at the three bestperforming countries
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9734242558479309;and if so do you look at eleven countries only or do you look at fifteen countries
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9902162551879883;those are things to be discussed at the time when actual entry into the euro zone becomes topical
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Negative;0.8451206088066101;question yesterday we heard some rumours in the markets that there are some interventions for the euro
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.5525808334350586;were those rumours or was it a fact
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.7270419001579285;duisenberg it was just rumours
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8916301727294922;and they were not factual
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.5984262824058533;question translation a further question on the exchange rate
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9328716993331909;it has been said time and again that the exchange rate is also being talked down by politicians not only by the economic data by the spread between business activity and the interest rates between euroland and the united states
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Negative;0.8688391447067261;mr stark the vicepresident of the bundesbank has argued that someone in the political arena should say that a strong euro is favourable for the monetary union
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9013902544975281;who should say that
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9200021624565125;are you that someone or do you miss such a statement from the group of finance ministers
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Positive;0.8826090693473816;duisenberg i will say that a stable euro is good for the monetary union
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9819968342781067;and i will say that most of all in the proper forum for example at the forthcoming meetings of the euro 11 group
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8867707252502441;that is what we want
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8640679121017456;question in listening to your statement it seems as though the risks came to the fore and i would like to ask you if you think today that the council has shifted its stance to looking more at the risks
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.7528862953186035;duisenberg i dont think so
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9638139605522156;nor do i think that if you compare todays statement with last months you will find a difference in tone
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Negative;0.842257022857666;we still see risks but we still see them both on the up side and on the down side
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.6390677094459534;question two questions
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Negative;0.6912156939506531;one you mentioned the recent wage developments that there was an upside risk to inflation
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9264624714851379;any word that you might have for the recent wage agreements found in germany
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Negative;0.7204660773277283;do they especially constitute such a risk
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8612191677093506;and the second question concerns the change in the auction style that you announced today for the longer term refinancing instruments
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9510206580162048;is this change also an attempt to block socalled empty bids
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9209860563278198;are you concerned about the high volume of bids that has been put in for the recent refinancing operations
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.7326602339744568;duisenberg the first question on wage developments
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9420137405395508;of course the most recent ones we have become aware of were those in germany
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Negative;0.7333526015281677;so of course in my statement we say that there is a potential risk involved
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.7051039934158325;not only a risk for prices
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9212052226066589;that in particular but also for growth and employment
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.97202467918396;so of course we have in particular those most recent wage developments in mind
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9912170171737671;secondly the phenomenon that the allotment percentage of the refinancing operations is very low and has even tended to become smaller week after week is a matter of concern
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8601320385932922;but the changeover for the longerterm refinancing operations has nothing to do with that
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.959297776222229;we will address this problem of a strong oversubscription to certain financing operations  which is there in some countries more than in others  we will address those questions in the course of next weeks
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Negative;0.958229660987854;question a few weeks ago you mentioned that the ecb might react to major misalignments in the exchange markets
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9114285707473755;unfortunately misalignment is open to different interpretations
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.953029990196228;so would you please line out the main factors the ecb uses to detect misalignment
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9787582159042358;duisenberg i have said repeatedly that within the broad range of indicators we monitor in order to determine our monetary policy strategy and decisions the exchange rate is an important indicator but only one
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.6029340624809265;but it is an important one
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9377785325050354;and if we came to the judgement that the exchange rate developments are really seriously out of line with the economic fundamentals of the various large areas in the world  europe and the united states  then we would probably react but i cannot elaborate on that any more than i have done right now
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9382254481315613;question translation mrduisenberg i have a question of a more general nature how would you assess the european populaces sentiment today two months from the introduction of the euro
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Positive;0.5107365250587463;do you feel that you have made good progress along the road of gradually gaining the trust of european citizens and where do you see a need to improve your communications to strengthen that confidence
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9893664717674255;and will english remain the only language in the long run in which the ecb wishes to communicate with the population in europe
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9550703167915344;duisenbergi believe we are well on the way
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.6720902323722839;what we also try to measure across europe is the confidence that the population at large has in the euro
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.599690854549408;the results of those efforts to measure the degree of confidence are becoming ever more positive not only in the euro area but even in some of the out countries and i could think of no means with which we could publish more than we are already doing and with which we could give more speeches than we are already delivering
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9256742596626282;i think we are making the most extensive publication efforts both in the form of articles or notes to be published of speeches being given intended for the public at large to inspire confidence in the euro and i would not know what to do where to find the time to do even more than that
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9679972529411316;as to the second part of the question we do communicate in all languages
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9804707765579224;all our official publications that are the annual report the quarterly report are published in the 11 languages of the community
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.983454704284668;we even decided which was not compulsory to publish our monthly bulletin in 11 languages in europe and then i must say we often give speeches in 11 languages to the extent that we are able to do that
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Negative;0.5107195377349854;question mr president do you see any signs at all in the euro zone of deflation particularly in france and germany
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8241682052612305;duisenberg we have carefully assessed that risk and we have come to the conclusion that there are no signs of deflation developing in the euro area as such at the moment
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9002654552459717;question mr duisenberg the german government interprets the flat yield curve as an indicator for a shortage in the demand for capital so that is one of the arguments behind the demands for lower interest rates
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9165744185447693;what is your opinion of this
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9246423840522766;can it be interpreted that way
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9811788201332092;duisenberg we do not think so and we will also discuss that in a thorough manner in the context of the forthcoming euro 11 meetings
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.7669276595115662;but then i would like to add that the yield curve has risen somewhat and has already become somewhat steeper over the past few weeks
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Negative;0.979804515838623;question i have two questions please the economic and financial committee  ex monetary committee  which met on monday and tuesday in brussels seemed to have serious doubts about the ability of france and germany to keep the budget deficit at around 2
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9062181115150452;how much of this loosening of consolidation efforts is going into the weakening of the euro
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9845970273017883;do you see that there is a lack of confidence which could lead to an increase in the longer term interest rates
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9191487431526184;thats the first question
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9731053709983826;and then the second are you concerned that the weakening of the german economy could entail also a weakening of the eastern european countries
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9757896661758423;duisenberg i am aware that the economic and financial committee held a twoday meeting earlier this week in which they discussed the stability programs of france germany and a few other countries on the basis of an analysis by the european commission which has in the meantime been made public
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9782552123069763;it contains some critical remarks with which the ecb fully agreed
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9726297855377197;and  as on earlier occasions  we and now also the european commission have expressed some concern about the determination of in particular the larger countries to adhere to the aims of the stability and growth pact and that in itself has led us to say that one of the risks we see of the upward risks is a looser fiscal position which you will find in my introductory statement if you read it carefully again
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Negative;0.98224937915802;the weakening of the german economy which has been evident over the last quarter of 1998 could of course have an impact on its surrounding partners including  as you asked so specifically  eastern europe
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Negative;0.8825687766075134;and it is for that reason that we do hope and very much encourage the german government to remedy some of the weakening of the economy whilst at the same time emphasising that such a weakening of the economy is not being caused by nor can it be remedied by monetary policy measures
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8499425053596497;question mr duisenberg i would agree that today your outlook seems as if you might be looking for scope on the downside maybe for an easing up as someone else just said and that maybe prices are one of the key factors you are looking at right now
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9382175803184509;duisenberg but then you are hineininterpretierend in my statement in which i gave equal weight i think to the upward and the downward shifts which led to the conclusion not to change interest rates at all
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9120064377784729;question so youre still neutral youre saying
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8272042274475098;duisenberg that is correct
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8761374950408936;question on foreign exchange if i were a foreign exchange trader you said that you want a stable euro
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Negative;0.951361358165741;i almost think that we are not getting close to a eurodollar level that makes you concerned right now
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.7857267260551453;is that a correct assumption
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.5268908143043518;duisenberg yes i am not concerned with the level that the euro has currently reached
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Negative;0.505608081817627;i already put it against the background of the levels of the dmark during last year and it is not so much the level that is of some concern
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9767955541610718;if the movement were to continue there could be cause for concern
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9357607960700989;question translation president duisenberg the federal minister of finance mr lafontaine was your guest
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9333135485649109;did he call for a reduction of the key interest rates as emphatically as he is doing in public or did he mumble about it and what did you tell him
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9526849389076233;duisenberg that was yes i believe that was two weeks ago and i must confess that i have heard him louder through the media than in direct contact
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9859646558761597;question mr duisenberg would you share the concern of the german government that a failure of european governments to reach an agreement on the financial architecture of the european union by the end of march could cause turmoil on financial markets and would weaken the euro
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9551340341567993;duisenberg no i am aware that one minister has made some statements to that effect today
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Negative;0.677118182182312;i do not share that concern
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.6701086759567261;i do not see what it can have to do with the functioning of the euro
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8869485855102539;question mr president you said you talked to mr lafontaine at the last meeting
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9713281989097595;he has given you a lot of suggestions what the ecb should be doing
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Negative;0.6405348181724548;you said that germany maybe should take some steps to remedy the economy
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9349734783172607;did you give him any specific advice about what germany should do with its economy
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Negative;0.983864963054657;duisenberg not specifically to germany but we continuously give advice to point to the ministers that the biggest problem they and we are facing in europe is the unemployment problem
1999-03-04;1999;March;REPORT;Negative;0.56935715675354;we keep explaining that the nature of that problem is predominantly of a structural nature the lacking flexibility of markets both labour and product markets and that if governments can do anything they could tackle and to our mind they should tackle that cause of the unemployment in the first place
