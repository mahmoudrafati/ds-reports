1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9764718413352966;the interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the eurosystem will thus remain 25
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9838641881942749;in addition the interest rate on the marginal lending facility will continue to be 35 and that on the deposit facility has been kept at 15
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9829427003860474;let me give you some details about our latest assessment of the monetary policy stance and thereby explain the decisions taken today
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9852064251899719;with regard to monetary developments in the euro area the threemonth moving average of m3 growth covering the period from march to may 1999 increased slightly to 52 from 51 in the three months up to april
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9629544019699097;consequently m3 growth remained above the reference value of 4½
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Positive;0.49767035245895386;the major contribution to the rise in m3 growth in may came from overnight deposits
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9891663193702698;with the exception of repurchase agreements marketable securities included in m3 also experienced higher growth
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9491065740585327;the annual growth rate of total credit to euro area residents rose in may from 73 in april to 79
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9803043007850647;the pickup in credit growth was visible both in loans and in securitised lending and occurred in respect of credit to both the private sector and the general government
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Positive;0.5101093053817749;the growth of loans to the private sector rose to 10 in may stimulated by the further decline in bank lending rates
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Positive;0.40241920948028564;taken together with the high pace of growth of the most liquid components of m3 this evidence supports the view that households and firms in the euro area do not currently face liquidity constraints
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9840864539146423;in the view of the governing council this situation is not seen as threatening price stability at present
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9628016948699951;however a reassessment may be appropriate if money and credit growth increase further
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9603896737098694;turning to financial market indicators we have seen a significant upturn in longterm interest rates in the euro area since the end of may
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9115926623344421;this development was certainly affected by the continued increase in bond yields in the united states over the same period
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9866567254066467;more recently however domestic factors have probably played a more important role in the determination of domestic bond yields than was previously the case
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9913495779037476;these factors include financial market perceptions of more evidence pointing to a further strengthening in economic activity in the euro area during the year accompanied by a modest pickup in inflation expectations from the low levels seen in recent months
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9842425584793091;the more positive market sentiment regarding the prospects for euro area output growth has also been reflected in a narrowing over recent weeks of the relatively wide differentials between us and euro area bond yields
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9751726984977722;exchange rate developments do not yet reflect these very same factors
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9891575574874878;as we have said on earlier occasions the governing council believes that the euro is firmly based on internal price stability and therefore has the clear potential to achieve a stronger external value
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Positive;0.8939136266708374;the governing council reaffirmed its view at todays meeting that the monetary policy of the eurosystem will safeguard the euros internal purchasing power and will thereby support its international value
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9901949763298035;the prospects for a more broadly based and sustained recovery in the world economy have become stronger
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9843984842300415;the outlook has improved further in particular in relation to expectations of continuously strong growth in the us economy and some tentative indications that the prolonged decline in activity in japan may have come to a halt
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9826395511627197;in addition recent developments in economic and financial indicators for the emerging market economies suggest that a recovery is under way in southeast asia
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9864237904548645;moreover to the extent that the kosovo conflict may have had a negative impact on economic sentiment in a number of countries its end has eliminated a risk to the outlook for economic developments in the euro area
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Positive;0.8107656836509705;as recent developments in latin america indicate the outlook has improved only moderately
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9847219586372375;with reference to developments in economic activity in the euro area some important data have been released since our last meeting
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9903640151023865;most notably eurostat has now started to publish euro area national accounts data which are based more closely on data compiled in accordance with the new esa 95 methodology
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.7291756272315979;according to these estimates the quarteronquarter rate of real gdp growth increased to 05 in the first quarter of this year compared with 03 in the previous quarter
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Negative;0.5188280344009399;at present there is insufficient experience with regard to the properties of the new esa 95 data in particular their susceptibility to revision and some caution should therefore be exercised when interpreting the most recent developments in real gdp growth
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9306835532188416;however further evidence supporting the view that growth will recover in the course of this year is also provided by the recent development of other indicators of economic activity
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Negative;0.8974555730819702;following successive declines the level of industrial production appears to have stabilised in the months up to april
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.7824155688285828;given the developments in industrial confidence up to june it would appear that the trough was reached at the end of the first quarter
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Positive;0.6239765882492065;this points to a turningpoint in activity in the industrial sector
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Negative;0.6916268467903137;at the same time household sector demand patterns appear to be broadly unchanged as indicated by a still high level of consumer confidence
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9902833700180054;therefore while the signs of recovery are still modest and are not yet reflected in labour market developments recent data appear to confirm the outlook for a continued improvement in the course of this year
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Positive;0.8393733501434326;the governing council considers it necessary that other policy areas make a decisive contribution to bolstering confidence in the euro areas growth potential particularly by means of firm structural reform measures to enhance the sustainability of public finances and the efficiency of labour and product markets
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.5373652577400208;looking at the latest developments in consumer prices the annual rate of increase in the harmonised index of consumer prices hicp fell to 10 in may down from 11 in april
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9416884779930115;while energy prices which had caused the rise in the overall hicp rate in the previous two months continued to exert some upward pressure this was more than offset by movements in other components
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9076744318008423;a lower rate of increase was recorded in may for both processed and unprocessed food prices and for services prices
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9698778390884399;hence the decline in the overall hicp rate was also reflected in the hicp rate excluding the two more volatile components  energy and seasonal food
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9790180921554565;these developments have to be seen partly in the context of a oneoff base effect resulting from countryspecific increases in indirect taxes which occurred last year
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9343796372413635;against this background the expectation remains that over the next few months the rate of price increases will tend to edge upwards mainly reflecting the increase in energy prices
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8756532073020935;in conclusion the outlook for the maintenance of price stability in the euro area remains favourable and in line with the eurosystems definition of price stability
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9908954501152039;the governing council therefore decided to maintain the prevailing levels of the ecb interest rates
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Positive;0.984097421169281;at the same time it noted that the sustained growth of monetary and credit aggregates the slight improvement in output growth in early 1999 the expectation of a strengthening in economic activity in the course of 1999 and a further acceleration next year all indicate that any upward pressures on prices will have to be monitored very carefully
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9860403537750244;let me now give the floor to the vicepresident to introduce two additional topics we discussed during the governing council meeting in addition to reviewing the main monetary financial and other economic indicators the governing council also considered the days on which the target system would be closed in the year 2000 with regard to the calendar of target operating days for 1999 the ecb announced on 31 march 1999 that the target system would close on 31 december 1999 in addition to saturdays and sundays christmas day and new years day
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9904301762580872;however considering the financial and social cost of keeping the target system open on days which are traditionally public holidays or bank holidays in most of the euro area and in view of the indication given by the european banking industry that it would welcome the closing of target on such days the governing council today decided in principle that next year  in addition to saturdays and sundays  target will be closed on new years day good friday easter monday 1 may labour day christmas day and 26 december
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9776437878608704;in countries where one of these days is not a public holiday the national central bank will endeavour to close the national rtgs system on the day in question or when this is not possible will seek to limit domestic payment activity as much as possible
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9527179002761841;you will find further information relating to this decision in the separate press release to be issued today
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9177261590957642;last and certainly not least it is my great pleasure to announce a very important milestone along the road to the introduction of the euro banknotes
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9838431477546692;the production of the euro banknotes has begun and by the end of this month euro banknote production will be under way in printing works in several euro area countries
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9879948496818542;as you will remember we presented the draft euro banknote designs in december 1996 the designs were subsequently adjusted and refined in order to meet the technical specifications in full
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.98172527551651;intensive work then began to convert the detailed designs into the origination material in other words the final dies films and plates which enable printing plates to be made
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.953558623790741;production of the pilot series started in september 1998 and was completed a few months ago
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.985317051410675;the printing of this pilot series involved the production of several million banknotes under normal operating conditions
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9676640629768372;this was a success and we therefore agreed that the participating national central banks could release their printing orders
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9801623821258545;the number of euro banknotes to be printed for the 11 participating member states before the launch  which will take place exactly 900 days from today  is estimated at 13 billion
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.985829770565033;to give you an idea of the size of the production process if the 13 billion euro banknotes were placed end to end they would stretch to the moon and back twice
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.990023672580719;as you may remember the governing council has already decided that the euro banknotes will not bear any national symbols and therefore will be totally identical irrespective of where they are produced
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9605388045310974;the euro banknotes are being produced in accordance with specifications of the very highest standard and they will include a wide range of sophisticated security features
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9392299056053162;the ecb has today issued a press release on this matter
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.939204752445221;a press folder containing inter alia tv footage and a brochure on the euro banknotes and coins has also been made available to the media
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9655055999755859;the brochure is available in all 11 official languages of the european union
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9242488145828247;transcript of the questions asked and the answers given by dr willem f duisenberg president of the ecb and christian noyer vicepresident of the ecb question translation president duisenberg for months and weeks there has repeatedly been great excitement the value of the euro visàvis the us dollar has been dropping constantly
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.6933861970901489;what do you think of this
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Negative;0.8531854152679443;do you think that this is not a problem
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9193860292434692;do you think it is slowly becoming a problem
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.6876285672187805;do you perhaps also believe that 11 is easier to remember
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.877735435962677;does it simplify calculations
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9608113169670105;duisenberg the last time i expressed myself publicly on the exchange rate it was precisely before this group at the press conference on 2 june this year
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.972200334072113;now six weeks later i can for the first time say something about the exchange rate again and i will not say anything more than that
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9222692847251892;i am prepared to repeat what i said
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Positive;0.989458441734314;we believe that the euro is firmly based on internal price stability and therefore has the excellent potential to achieve a stronger external value
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9801514148712158;that view was confirmed again by the governing council today
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.845805823802948;the view is that the monetary policy of the eurosystem will safeguard the euros internal purchasing power and will thereby support its external value
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9676430821418762;that is what i had to say what i have to say about the exchange rate
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9583688974380493;it is all that i am going to say about it
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9535847902297974;question how do you evaluate the situation in the member states when it concerns the structural reforms that you are demanding in every press conference and every situation
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8850047588348389;are they going as you have expected
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9679552316665649;duisenbergwell they have differed in various member states
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9709621667861938;in some member states measures have been taken to increase the flexibility of the economy in certain respects
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8983458280563354;but looking at the euro area as a whole it is certainly far from sufficient
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9892815351486206;many many more structural measures have to be taken in most if not all of the euro area member states
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.7205667495727539;question i have two questions
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.93839430809021;with your comments on inflation and in the monthly bulletin as well about the importance of monitoring inflation
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Negative;0.6438484787940979;would you say that the ecb is moving to a tightening bias for interest rates
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9116002917289734;that is the first question
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9307258725166321;and the second question is did the council today discuss investor confidence in the euro and what conclusions did you reach in your discussion
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9556558132171631;duisenberg what i have said is that we do not see price stability as being threatened at present
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9539821147918701;but if money and credit growth increases further a reassessment may be appropriate
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9649810194969177;you could interpret that not as a bias but as a bias gradually creeping into our considerations
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9906631708145142;we did not explicitly discuss investors confidence in the euro but we did very explicitly discuss the development of the euro which includes of course an assessment of investors confidence
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9848265647888184;as our answer we expressed our strong belief that the success of our policy to maintain price stability would over time underline and underscore the inherent strength of the euro
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Negative;0.6690029501914978;question in the monthly report which came out two days ago you were saying that a reassessment of the fact that monetary growth is currently not threatening price stability might be in order if growth should pick up further
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8540129661560059;now you are saying that it might be in order if m3 growth might pick up further
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9337889552116394;is that the same or is there a difference in these two statements
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9302901029586792;duisenberg it is the same
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.5679826736450195;question so more growth means more m3 growth
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Negative;0.864427387714386;is there not a problem that 
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.5724000930786133;duisenberg 
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Positive;0.8314698934555054;and i added morecredit growth
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Negative;0.8565412759780884;question yes is there not a problem that you have often said that the relation between real growth and credit growth might have shifted and might not be so stable anymore
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.5387696027755737;duisenberg no that is not a problem
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.946724534034729;but it requires a careful assessment and judgement about what is actually happening and going on  also in the monetary world
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Negative;0.4990026652812958;and that is under the new circumstances somewhat more difficult than it used to be in the past before the euro was created
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.7467805743217468;question translation two questions
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.7892870903015137;the first on the confidence of the markets in the euro
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.793117880821228;if the monthly bulletin is read carefully one gains the impression that the governing council or economists at the ecb are taking a somewhat new look at the interest rate cut of april because the econometric models had already indicated an economic recovery in the first quarter
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Negative;0.970642626285553;is the difficulty in understanding your interest rate cut perhaps also a reason for the euro not having gained the confidence in the markets that it should have had in terms of its internal stability
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Negative;0.7990820407867432;the second question concerns fiscal policy in the euro area
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9192976951599121;on monday you submitted a financial report to the ecofin council concerning the fulfilment of the stability and growth pact which is now being discussed
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Negative;0.8908529281616211;how do you regard the statements on the stability pact for instance those of the planning council in paris that are placing this pact in question because it might curb the growth momentum
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9075989723205566;what results did the discussion of this matter by the governing council have
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9192416071891785;duisenberg that was a very long question i will ask mr noyer to answer the second part
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8553156852722168;but as far as the first part is concerned the key word was confidence and another key expression was our interest rate decision of 8 april
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9290353059768677;all i can say is that circumstances may change and i have already answered the question about the bias using the word creeping in
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9505266547203064;we do not in any way regret our decision of 8 april
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9874067902565002;we believe that this was an appropriate decision at the appropriate moment and of course the effects of monetary policy decisions will become evident only with a very long time lag
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9013481140136719;in the meantime what we do want is to maintain the climate of stability of stabilityoriented policies as perceived by the public  and as it must be perceived by the public
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.7807325124740601;noyer on the second question
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9774961471557617;i suppose that you make reference to a report that was issued by a working group of an economic institute a kind of a thinktank even if it has an official name  commission general de plan
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9405910968780518;in fact today it works like any economic institute undertaking research
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9703154563903809;that report did contain the remark you are referring to and this has been firmly denied by the french government very officially and several times by the finance minister and the prime minister of france
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9187922477722168;for us there is no such indication at all as you have said
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9396763443946838;question i believe mr hutter was also referring to something else
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9676441550254822;this morning news agencies reported on a financial report of the ecb to the ecofin council in which the ecb complained that the fiscal criteria were being endangered by the member states
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9528822898864746;well it has already been confirmed to me that this report exists
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9761295914649963;i would like to know  in its monthly bulletins the ecb does not ever name the countries that are running counter to the stability pact
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.6608344912528992;are the culprits named in this report
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.7796334624290466;have you actually complained about germany france or whomsoever
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8884294033050537;that was the first question
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9779501557350159;the second question has the procedure for the transfer of the second reserve instalment of 50 billion from the national central banks to the ecb been closed has it been approved
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9293313026428223;and my third question concerns one of your press releases today
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9846023321151733;it states that it can be noted that the designs which have meanwhile been published differ from the actual appearance of the euro banknotes
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8089455366134644;what does this mean
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9757869243621826;will we be getting other banknotes than those you are showing us pictures of here or 
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9330637454986572;would you please elaborate
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8962730765342712;duisenberg christian you went to the ecofin
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9602281451225281;can you give a report on individual criteria
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8683416843414307;noyer no unfortunately i cannot give any report
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9918280839920044;i think reference is made to a report that had traditionally been made by the european monetary institute during the time of the preparation of all the decisions on which countries would join the euro area from the beginning
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.978255569934845;that report was taking care of all criteria
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.895218014717102;the ecb has simply continued this practice
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9687274098396301;not because there is any possible consequence but because we have the technical knowledge and habit of doing this with the help of all the national central banks of the eurosystem
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9707090854644775;it might be helpful for governments to have a number of technical analyses in looking at their own fiscal stances
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.966793954372406;it does not look at all at the short term of course
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.675396740436554;it looks more at the medium term and at the risks that may arise if a number of improvements are not pursued and if there are adverse developments in the medium or long term in for instance the real economy
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Negative;0.5965437293052673;but to take the most obvious example if the governments were all sticking to exactly 3 and then in the case of a future recession it would obviously be extremely difficult for governments to not breach the 3
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Positive;0.8971536159515381;so we say in that case there is a strong reason why sticking to the stability and growth pact will give you the room for manoeuvre
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9719191789627075;that is the global assessment
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8280059099197388;but it does not point to any risk of such a development in the short term
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.4758165776729584;first because progress has been made and second because economic developments are going to look better as the president has explained
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9558082222938538;so it cannot be concluded from this that there is a risk in the foreseeable future
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8608230352401733;in the analysis that we have done many times and that has been very clear to all of you either from the monthly bulletins or from other publications we have repeatedly said that an actual implementation of the stability and growth pact and of the programmes that all countries have designed for themselves are very important as a safeguard against any kind of downward trend in the future
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9550106525421143;it does not mean that we foresee that there will be any slowdown of economic growth in the foreseeable future
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9652737379074097;so there is no immediate implication for one country or another
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8961992859840393;question what about the individual countries
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9545408487319946;noyer well there is an analysis of all countries  yes
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8926922082901001;but it is not pointing at a specific risk of a breach in specific countries
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9746798872947693;for all countries it analyses the strengths and weaknesses in the fiscal consolidation process which of course are different  the balance is different from one country to the other
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.7248064279556274;but it is not pointing at certain countries in saying that there is a special risk of breaching the 3
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9670553803443909;this is not the objective of the analysis
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9453119039535522;it is more to give analytical help to countries to better shape their process of fiscal consolidation
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9810070395469666;duisenberg and to add one sentence as i told you the meeting today was attended by the president of the ecofin council mr niinistö and  i must say to our great satisfaction  he reported that the ecofin council had at its last meeting unanimously endorsed its commitment to the stability and growth pact and we were very pleased with that
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.5199878215789795;as far as the 50 billion euro in foreign reserves are concerned i do not think that they have already been turned over
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9655461311340332;and it is not that important either because all foreign exchange reserves already come under the management of the ecb whether they are in the hand of or still in the coffers of the national central banks
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8553785085678101;the third question on the appearance of the banknotes dont read to much in that
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9118711352348328;essentially nothing has changed
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9753140807151794;to give you one example why the banknotes  when they are issued  will look slightly different from those that were published as illustrations some time ago in those that have been published there was a fake signature
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9098379015922546;ultimately there will be my signature  that is the difference
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.980639636516571;and another difference to mention another example is that the banknotes also bear the word euro in greek letters
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.963394820690155;in the ultimate series the word euro will still be there in greek letters but it will be somewhat shadier than in those published earlier
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.5929049849510193;question mr duisenberg two questions concerning your monetary bias
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Positive;0.5293039083480835;the first one given the current situation on the money market a change to a variable rate may have some positive effects
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.96978360414505;was such a change to variable rate tender discussed today or on any other occasion lately
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8851324319839478;duisenberg it was not discussed today
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9748289585113525;it will be discussed in the coming months
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9338894486427307;whether the system will change is still open
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.6568917036056519;question the second question about the creeping bias
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9878458380699158;do you intend to keep the public informed about the changes in the bias of the ecb  just like the fed did lately  or is it up to the fedwatchers to decipher the statements that come in the form of the monthly bulletins
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9294414520263672;what exactly is your monetary stance at the moment
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9453392624855042;duisenberg yes we do intend to be as open and transparent as we possibly can
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9748712182044983;and as your colleague had already concluded from the monthly bulletin there might have been some slight change in tone that was confirmed today in my statement and we will monitor the developments in the months to come very carefully
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9398666620254517;question i would like to know whether the euro notes which were stolen near paris  the printing plates  whether you have got them back and are you going to be able to use them
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.5421129465103149;and is it a problem for you that there are 10 printing works which are going to produce the euro notes
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.7037670612335205;they do not always have the same printing machines so that there may be quality differences
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Negative;0.8174319863319397;are you worried about that
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8294156789779663;noyer the first question actually the material was not stolen near paris as far as i know but nobody knows where it disappeared
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.96630859375;somewhere in the air probably
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9533747434616089;it was a crossborder transfer
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.907086193561554;but the real answer is that it has not been found but it could not have been used because it was not final
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9168509840965271;the stolen material is of no use at all
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9313874244689941;we have changed the features to have something that is absolutely safe
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.7999856472015381;duisenberg i can take the second question
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Negative;0.5953836441040039;is it a problem no
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9893752336502075;when there are 10 printing works producing these banknotes it is monitored very very carefully that they are identical across the 10 printing works involved
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Positive;0.7487955689430237;i might add that the start of production yesterday was a total success in all printing works
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9098008871078491;question so you are saying that todays reportin the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung is wrong
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8272042274475098;duisenberg that is correct
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8924999833106995;question could you just very briefly tell us a little bit more about the safety features of the new euro banknotes
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8629649877548218;duisenberg the answer is no
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.7490155696868896;we will not reveal at this time specifics of the extensive safety features which have been incorporated into the new banknotes but we will start an extensive information campaign well before the actual issuance of the banknotes to make the public and the experts the cashiers at banks and in the retail sector very familiar with the safety features as they have been incorporated
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.7784836292266846;question president duisenberg the ecb is lending money to banks at lower rates but bonds are being issued at higher rates

1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.57427579164505;do you not think that your accommodating monetary policy is not being taken seriously
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Negative;0.6514686942100525;duisenberg the shortterm interest rates have hardly moved over the past six weeks

1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Negative;0.8068737387657166;so that is not a cause for concern
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9745556712150574;at the long end of the yield curve there has been a significant move to an average yield for government paper of now 49 which is one of the factors i have discussed in my introductory statement
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9627618789672852;it is not a cause of concern which would in our opinion threaten price stability
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9707826972007751;but this has to be monitored very closely
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8139537572860718;question when looking at the upcoming situation regarding price stability has your assessment been influenced by the possibility of the degree  however small  of imported inflation from the lower exchange rate of the euro against the dollar
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9807969331741333;duisenberg we continuously assess that and we then come to the same conclusions that you had formulated so adequately in the article you published yesterday

1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9790170788764954;do you think the politicians comments on the euro are on balance helpful or would you prefer that the ecb or you as president had sole responsibility for commenting on the development of the currency
1999-07-15;1999;July;REPORT;Negative;0.5474388599395752;duisenberg well that is an unrealistic prospect
