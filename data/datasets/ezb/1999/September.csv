1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9891875386238098;the governing council reviewed the outlook for price developments and the risks to price stability in the euro area in line with its monetary policy strategy
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9793211221694946;as a result the governing council decided not to change the prevailing ecb interest rates
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9764718413352966;the interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the eurosystem will thus remain 25
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9838641881942749;in addition the interest rate on the marginal lending facility will continue to be 35 and that on the deposit facility has been kept at 15
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9787417650222778;let me give you some details about our review of the latest information on monetary financial and other economic developments as well as about our latest assessment of the monetary policy stance and thereby explain the decisions taken today
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9713481068611145;with regard to monetary developments in the euro area the 12month growth rate of the broad monetary aggregate m3 increased from 53 in june to 56 in july 1999 the latest threemonth average of m3 growth covering the period from may to july 1999 rose to 54 compared with 53 in the previous threemonth period from april to june 1999 overall the annual rate of growth of m3 has been moving away from the reference value of 4Â½ since the start of the year
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Positive;0.9918117523193359;this upward movement may be explained to a large extent by the very low opportunity costs of holding monetary assets especially the most liquid components but perhaps also by the gradually improving economic conditions in the euro area
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.6927053332328796;at the same time the annual growth rate of credit to the private sector remained high even though it declined by 05 percentage point in july to 104
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9727426767349243;the monetary policy strategy of the eurosystem assigns a prominent role to the behaviour of m3
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Negative;0.4024932086467743;accordingly recent monetary developments merit close attention
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Negative;0.7439060807228088;at the same time taking into account the fact that we are still in a very early phase of monetary union and that figures for broad money growth have been subject to some revisions in recent months shorterterm monetary developments need to be interpreted with caution
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Positive;0.9554140567779541;concerning financial market indicators the upturn in longterm interest rates in the euro area seen since early may continued in august and early september
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Positive;0.5358501076698303;domestic factors seem to have played a dominant role as indicated by the fact that differentials between us and euro area bond yields have narrowed further
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Positive;0.9920171499252319;in particular market participants appear to be increasingly optimistic about the prospects for economic activity in the euro area
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.930425763130188;at the same time expectations for inflation as reflected by inter alia the signs emanating from indexlinked bonds issued in the euro area tend to indicate that markets still expect an evolution of consumer prices which will remain compatible with price stability
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Positive;0.987118124961853;developments in the world economy continue to show signs of improvement
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Positive;0.9918056726455688;growth in the us economy continues and some positive economic signals have been recorded for japan
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Negative;0.7051860690116882;while the outlook for stronger growth in the global economy is also supported by recent developments in other regions notably southeast asia some risks remain primarily in relation to the strength of the recovery in latin america
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Positive;0.9915732741355896;as regards economic activity in the euro area industrial production data up to june point to a further improvement in output growth in the second quarter of this year as has already been indicated by various survey data
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Positive;0.9907376170158386;moreover available evidence in terms of retail sales data and consumer confidence while somewhat more mixed suggest broadly sustained consumption growth
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Positive;0.8416566848754883;these developments are consistent with recently published forecasts which foresee an upturn in economic growth in the course of this year
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9913004040718079;the downside risks pertaining to these projections have tended to recede and real gdp growth might eventually turn out to be somewhat higher than currently forecast
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9901665449142456;as generally expected consumer price increases as measured by the harmonised index of consumer prices hicp picked up in july with the annual rate of change rising from 09 in june to 11 in july
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Positive;0.9854324460029602;this effectively reversed the downward movement in the overall hicp rate which had been evident since april 1999 while prices for unprocessed food declined further in july this downward effect on the overall hicp rate was more than offset by a stronger increase in energy prices resulting from a continued rise in oil prices
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Negative;0.46295809745788574;we expect consumer price increases to rise somewhat further from their july levels mainly as a consequence of higher oil prices
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.7792714238166809;however at this stage we also expect this further increase to level out below the ceiling we have defined as being compatible with price stability over the medium term
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Positive;0.9872293472290039;in conclusion the prospects for a sustained economic upturn in the euro area are good as are the chances of continued price stability
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Negative;0.6967055797576904;however we remain vigilant taking into account the upward risks to price stability
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9561066031455994;in particular with a view to conducting a thorough assessment of the risks to price stability in the medium term the increase in monetary growth over recent months and the high growth rate of credit to the private sector need to be monitored very carefully
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Negative;0.644619345664978;in addition the shortterm upward pressure on consumer prices which stems from the increase in oil prices over recent months and the lagged passthrough of developments in the exchange rate have to be taken into account
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Negative;0.8698232769966125;if accompanied by continued wage moderation these factors alone should not be expected to threaten the current outlook for price stability
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.979712963104248;accordingly the results of the wage bargaining round for the year 2000 will play a particularly important role for the further assessment of price developments in the euro area
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8131641745567322;the only way to prolong a noninflationary recovery and hence to substantially reabsorb the still very high unemployment is for all responsible parties to act decisively in the near term to increase flexibility in the labour product and service markets
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.7409754991531372;this would also be the best way to allow the economy to take full advantage from the present stance of monetary policy
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9925299286842346;taking all this information into account the governing council decided to maintain the prevailing ecb interest rates
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Positive;0.9549981355667114;in addition it stressed that low inflation and therefore low interest rates should encourage higher investment helping to prevent the emergence of capacity constraints during economic expansion
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Positive;0.9911215305328369;at the same time the expected improvement in economic activity offers greater opportunities to cut fiscal deficits further and to enhance structural reforms
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.7769683003425598;indeed the creation of this virtuous circle depends on all policymakers playing their part
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9505654573440552;let me now give the floor to the vicepresident to introduce three additional topics which we discussed during our meetings
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9588134288787842;in addition to reviewing the main monetary financial and other economic indicators we discussed issues relating to the transition to the year 2000 we are now approaching the final phase of testing activities in connection with preparatory work for the century date change
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9774348735809326;on 25 september 1999 the ecb and the eu national central banks will conduct a demonstration of the target year 2000 compliance in which  according to current information  several hundred eu credit institutions will participate
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9839488863945007;prior to this the ecb and the national central banks have already successfully tested their target components first at the national level and thereafter in crossborder tests
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9578803181648254;to a large extent credit institutions have already taken part in these tests
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Positive;0.5185880661010742;in parallel as announced a few weeks ago on 29 june 1999 the ecb together with the national central banks successfully completed the bilateral testing of the escb applications that are necessary for the conduct of monetary policy operations
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9448103308677673;the testing exercise together with the parallel remedial actions has proved that these systems are year 2000 compliant
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9675868153572083;you may recall that on 15 july 1999 we decided to close target on 31 december 1999 in order to smooth the transition not only for the escb institutions but also for the other financial institutions
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9647288918495178;this day can thus be kept free for endofyear operations and for making full backups of the relevant systems
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9659921526908875;in the area of target as well as in the area of monetary policy implementation and liquidity management we are also reviewing our contingency procedures to minimise any potential year 2000related impact
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9829685091972351;it is worth noting that general contingency procedures had already been put in place shortly before the launch of the euro
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8246981501579285;in addition we will use an efficient communication infrastructure between the ecb and the national central banks to monitor developments over the year 2000 transition period
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.6060734391212463;the ecb will also share information with the joint year 2000 council and will thereby extend its monitoring capabilities beyond the eurosystem to a global perspective
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.970734715461731;as far as our monetary policy framework is concerned we are convinced that it is flexible enough and has builtin mechanisms designed to deal with any level of liquidity demand that might arise in the euro markets
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9732292890548706;indeed should any adaptation be advisable this would be of limited importance and consistent with the overall setup
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9479249715805054;we have analysed different scenarios and have come to the conclusion that the eurosystem will be in a position to cope with any potential increase in the demand for liquidity
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9343768358230591;the stock of banknotes held by national central banks is sufficient to allow for a considerable additional demand for banknotes in circulation and the amount of collateral available in the eurosystem will be sufficient to allow for the corresponding increase in refinancing needs of the banking system
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Positive;0.943071186542511;we are therefore confident that the eurosystem will continue its operations smoothly on 3 january 2000 after the century date change
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9739946722984314;we also reviewed crossborder retail payment services which are essential for the smooth functioning of the single market
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Positive;0.7571819424629211;we believe that citizens and businesses can only benefit fully from the fundamental principles of the free movement of goods services capital and people if they are also able to transfer money as rapidly reliably and cheaply from one part of the european union to another as is now the case within each member state
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.7148697376251221;despite the introduction of the euro however there is still a clear gap between the service levels of domestic and crossborder retail payment systems in terms of quality efficiency and pricing
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Negative;0.8907439708709717;the substantial disparities between domestic and crossborder services ought now to be reduced and should ultimately disappear
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.6073251962661743;in order to encourage the development of crossborder payment systems enabling the public to benefit more fully from the single currency the eurosystem has drawn up a set of objectives for crossborder retail payments in the euro area
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9564897418022156;these will be detailed in a separate press release which will be issued in the coming days
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9890611171722412;the eurosystem calls on the banking and payment service industry to fulfil these objectives by 1 january 2002 at the latest
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Negative;0.5572648644447327;finally i would like to inform you that we also discussed issues related to fraud prevention
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9624283313751221;i would like to emphasise that the ecb shares the concerns of the european parliament the eu council and the commission about the protection of the communities financial interests against fraud and other detrimental activities
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9758054614067078;consequently for the sake of transparency efficiency and accountability the governing council decided to establish an external supervisory committee to enforce an antifraud scheme at the ecb
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9770553112030029;this committee will establish a cooperative relationship with the european antifraud office olaf
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9318070411682129;we are now at your disposal should you have any questions
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Negative;0.5151605010032654;transcript of the questions asked and the answers given by dr willem f duisenberg president of the ecb and christian noyer vicepresident of the ecb question with regard to the year 2000 problem handling the liquidity situation is one thing and that is one problem that the european system of central banks has to look at
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8133193254470825;but have you made any studies in regard to the liquidity impact or the changes of behaviour which may be irrational on the part of savers visÃ vis monetary and credit aggregates because we could be in a situation for instance where savers decide to liquidate assets financial assets to put money on accounts  you would have a clear situation in which monetary aggregates would therefore indicate very little in terms of an irrational indicator for policy
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8439840078353882;have you any opinion on that
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9622397422790527;noyer we will see if there is a specific demand for liquidity that is clearly related to this period that will probably show up in the last weeks of this year and the very beginning of next year
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9411334991455078;if this is the case we will of course have to take due account of that in terms of disturbances in the monetary indicators
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9805945754051208;but that can be taken into account within the framework of our instruments and analysis
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9763689041137695;so of course if there is a special disturbance we will have to take that into account and make an assessment excluding the exceptional factor that would then have arisen
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.7648146748542786;but that is not a big problem in theory in terms of the policy indicators
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9465107917785645;but you will remember that when we made the choice of the monetary policy strategy last year and we made the choice of the reference value one of the explanations for calling that a reference value was that we were cautious for many reasons
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.5827745199203491;one of the reasons was that there might have been a special shock related to the introduction of the euro
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9293579459190369;i would say the same sort of caution must be exercised with the year 2000 there might be a shock at least in the statistical series and we must of course be prepared to deal with it
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9457995295524597;however we have the technical capacities  we think so  to make the distinction between the trends that are behind that and any event or statistical move that would be clearly linked to a very transitional year 2000related shock
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9822052121162415;question mr president it was always stated that the ecb is in charge of monetary policy for the entire euro zone and not only for the big countries like germany
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.5298780798912048;so let me ask you was the decision to leave interest rates unchanged influenced to some extent by the shopping list of mr welteke who obviously likes low interest rates for his sluggish economy at the moment
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9896424412727356;as you know he stated in berlin for television just a few days ago that inflation is under control and that the ecb interest rate should remain unchanged
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Negative;0.6470814943313599;we all know that the low interest rates will not solve the german unemployment problem and let me recall that monetary growth has now been clearly above the reference value for an extended period
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.48484501242637634;and furthermore the reference value is not just another figure but an important help
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9745215177536011;it seems to achieve something that no central bank in the world has ever achieved yet namely to keep inflation between 0 and 2 in the medium run
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9418031573295593;so i would like to have your opinion on that
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.973762571811676;duisenberg well my opinion is very brief can be very briefly formulated our decisions today again and as always were based on a euro areawide analysis of economic and financial developments  and nothing else
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9373263716697693;and as regards the development of m3 i can only repeat what has just been said by the vicepresident and what was said in reply to the first question we had
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.6831300854682922;we have to deal with monetary figures in a structurally changed environment monetary figures which are only of a very recent nature and we have to interpret them with extreme caution
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Positive;0.9712532162666321;question you have painted a rather positive optimistic picture of the economy in the euro area and also of the inflation outlook
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9803556203842163;the inflation outlook is at the moment as you said benign
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8153685927391052;i am wondering whether you would say that the tightening bias that you said a few weeks ago was creeping into the ecbs thinking that this tightening bias is creeping out again so to speak
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8289424180984497;and secondly can i ask you about your elusive forecast lets put it that way
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Negative;0.8733355402946472;you said that the gdp growth might eventually turn out to be somehow higher than currently forecast
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9526334404945374;can you give us a figure or can you tell us at least what you think the current forecast is
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Negative;0.5413416028022766;i would like you to put a figure on this somewhat higher than currently forecast
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9671329855918884;and if you are not willing to do that maybe you can give us an indication of what you think is currently forecast so that we know what you think what will be then higher than  what figure
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8872189521789551;duisenbergfirst on the bias
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8987016677856445;its creeping and it remains creeping  but at snails pace you might say
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9660521149635315;the bias was introduced by me in reply to a question
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9172909259796143;question so it keeps creeping in then
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.48814961314201355;duisenberg oh it continues to creep
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9437445998191833;and on the forecast
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9849735498428345;if you compare the forecast we had with those of most of the international institutions as well as those of national forecasting bureaus we have forecasts of some 80 institutions which we regularly consult
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9847837686538696;back in april the general forecast was that growth this year would be in the order of 2 that next year it would be in the order generally speaking of 2Â½ of 2Â½
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Positive;0.7366368174552917;we now distinctly feel that both these forecasts will be surpassed in reality
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8235166072845459;for this year we now expect an outcome higher than we and everybody else expected in april and the same holds true for next year
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Negative;0.3797200322151184;so we are distinctly i might confirm this more optimistic now on the outlook of the development of the real economy both for this year and for next year than we were three months ago
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9548768997192383;question next week you will participate in the ecofin meeting in turku in finland and there will be discussions about the plans to strengthen the coordination of economic policy
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9089358448982239;how do you see this process and what is your role in this coordination
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9403067231178284;duisenberg now before that discussion takes place and before i answer that question i would rather have the discussion first in turku in which i will make my contribution together with mr noyer
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9707050919532776;and then afterwards we can report on what role we see for the ecb
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9647775888442993;i want to emphasise that we the ecb will be a full participant in the broad macroeconomic dialogue that was decided upon at the cologne summit
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9460222125053406;question then what is your message to the ministers of finance in turku
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.6567503213882446;is it to cut more budget deficits
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Positive;0.9080687165260315;duisenberg well the message you might want to repeat is what i said in my introductory statement namely to continue on the road to increasing flexibility in the labour product and service markets to take measures especially in a period when the economy and the economic outlook are brighter than we had foreseen earlier
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.598513126373291;it seems to be a golden opportunity to take further measures both in the sphere of reducing the fiscal deficits and in the sphere of structural measures to increase the flexibility of markets
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9770012497901917;and that is the message i give here today via you and i will also give it directly in turku
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8831700682640076;question just coming back to creeping bias some analysts said that the introduction of that bias was an indirect way of helping the euro escape from dollar parity
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Positive;0.9380602240562439;well the euro performed its great escape act
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9824044108390808;you must have looked at that with some satisfaction but looking now at the level of the currency we heard ernst welteke saying early this week that he thought 105 was an appropriate level for the currency
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8775856494903564;do you agree with that or do you think that he was wrong to say any specific level for the euro
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9036980867385864;duisenberg i will not be tempted to indicate any specific level which is good
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9790494441986084;i publicly declare that the level at which the euro is trading now and has already been trading for 5 or 6 weeks is to my mind an understandable level
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.928887128829956;question so do you agree with mr weltekes broad remarks or do you think he was wrong to make that statement
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9699109196662903;duisenberg i am not reacting to anybodys remarks in this area and you will have noted that the word exchange rate did not appear in todays statement
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.7957227826118469;and i might add that this was deliberate
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9412729144096375;question mr duisenberg last time you mentioned that the issue of variable rate repos could be discussed at this meeting and i am wondering if you did discuss it and what was the result of the discussion
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8177701830863953;duisenberg well the answer is no we did not discuss it
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9154782891273499;questionbut last time you expected the discussion to come up
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8235457539558411;i mean do you think
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9735814929008484;duisenberg i did not indicate a specific date when it will be discussed
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9109213352203369;it will undoubtedly be discussed at one of the forthcoming meetings but what the result of that discussion will be i cannot predict
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8784942626953125;question mr duisenberg i would like to come back to the question of m3
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9875712394714355;deutsche bank recently made a study of m3 in relation to inflation and in relation to interest rates as seen from the last 40 years and in terms of how the bundesbank was behaving
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9792003631591797;and it showed a quite close relationship between inflation and the interest rates but no relationship to monetary growth
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8205980062484741;the question is now is inflation much more important than monetary growth m3 or how should we judge it
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9813485741615295;duisenberg well the answer is that we like the deutsche bank are studying and assessing the impact of developments of m3 on inflation in the medium term
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9562109112739563;and the monetary aggregate as you know is an important reference value underlying our policy decisions
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Negative;0.5485424399375916;but at the same time  and here i come back to the first question asked  we are still at a very early stage
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.5734595656394958;and it is not sure to what extent the structural and cultural shock of the introduction of the euro may itself have changed behaviour and relationships of investors and consumers across the euro area
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9796032309532166;so we have to deal with it very very carefully and we do not yet have long enough time series for the new situation to come up with conclusions which are very similar to the conclusions that for example the study of the deutsche bank came up with on the basis of a time series extending over 40 years or so
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9741119742393494;question mr duisenberg you are not only going to turku you are going to washington to the g7 and the imf annual meetings
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9467361569404602;in its outlook the imf pointed out that the risks of the equity markets in the united states and in the world as a whole may be too high and they also refer to the dollar
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9525815844535828;what is the analysis that you are going to bring into the g7 and do you think that this analysis will have some effect on the ecb and so what
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9626947045326233;duisenbergi would like to point out that the structure of the economy especially the financial structure and for example the ownership of equity and the dispersion amongst the public at large in the united states is very different from that in europe
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8527179956436157;the general phenomenon which the imf pointed to is whether asset price inflation is going on
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9887126684188843;and asset price inflation in the united states in the first instance expresses itself in terms of the development of the prices for equity
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.5361030697822571;in europe this phenomenon is related far more to developments in the area of real estate
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.898976743221283;now there are some pockets of the euro area where we see a hefty development of real estate prices but certainly not euro areawide
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9718895554542542;certainly not enough to give us cause for concern but we try to monitor it as closely as we can
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9502958059310913;question mr duisenberg i would like to come back to the issue of the variable rate tender
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Negative;0.956762433052063;there has been some speculation whether you might switch to the variable rate tender and then there have been comments i believe of mr issing who said this might lead to an undesired increase in interest rates because banks tend to bid up themselves
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9070473313331604;to me this argument always applies and not only today
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.976666271686554;and still you pick the variable rate tender as one of your possible instruments
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9681017994880676;could you give us another argument that only applies to the specific situation today against the variable rate tender
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.7811035513877869;duisenberg no i cannot
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9054672122001648;we did not even consider the issue in the governing council today
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.98867267370224;we have the instrument available in principle to switch to a variable rate tender if we were to deem that necessary
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9651070237159729;but from our decisions today you can derive that we do not deem it necessary at short notice
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9111509919166565;question translation president duisenberg your friend karl otto pÃ¶hl after he was president of the bundesbank said that he did not really understand what m3 had to do with official rates
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.920763373374939;he said he never understood the correlation between the two
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.7736377716064453;now i ask you perhaps to prevent a myth if you think that too
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9057833552360535;is m3 so important or is it just a way of keeping the hawks and the doves in a balance on the board
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9377941489219666;this is the only reason he said it was ever mentioned  to keep the hawks and the doves on the board on an equal footing
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8978428840637207;duisenberg we do think i do think with many others that money matters and that the developments in the monetary aggregates do have an impact over time with a long lag on the rate of inflation
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9488415122032166;the transmission mechanism as such is somewhat in the dark i admit
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.6505959630012512;but money matters
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9322267770767212;we understand that and that is why we also take it as an important reference value
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9819840788841248;but only as a reference value to guide us in our policy decisions
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.773849606513977;and it has nothing to do with hawks and doves
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8877953886985779;question translation let me ask again how strongly must the money supply m3 rise before you say that the official interest rates must rise
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.7824254631996155;president of course i cannot answer that question because  and i keep on coming back to it  we have to interpret the movements in m3 in a totally new environment and with totally new time series with great caution
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8647499680519104;so it would be very irresponsible if i even tried to begin to answer your question
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.960541844367981;question mr duisenberg if we were to look over the last eight or nine months of this year we would see that other central banks in the world have tended to move interest rates more often than the ecb has done
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9687275290489197;the ecb has only done it once in april
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.7550356984138489;is that a sign that your approach to monetary policy is less activist so to speak than say the us fed or the bank of england that you prefer to wait a long time before seeing the impact of rate changes
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9606289863586426;we saw the bank of england change yesterday and the fed has moved recently but the ecb has kind of held firm for longer than other central banks
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9793720841407776;president we explicitly base our monetary policy decisions on  what we have publicly said  a mediumterm outlook
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9601010084152222;we are not moved by the daytoday fluctuations in economic variables as we see them as i also indicated in my statement
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.982178270816803;we tend to attach greater importance to threemonth moving figures than to the volatility of onemonth figures or even daily figures
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8454024195671082;so from that you might derive that we are indeed not inclined to try to finetune the economy with monetary policy or to give finetuning answers to shortterm developments
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Negative;0.6217689514160156;so in that aspect you might say that we are somewhat less activist than some other central banks in the world tend to be
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.7252174615859985;question my question is related to the crossborder retail payment service initiative
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.980246365070343;does this mean that euro area commercial banks will be asked to lower significantly the costs of the crossborder transfers
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Negative;0.7301486134529114;noyer it is a little bit more complicated than that
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.7685142159461975;i apologise that we are not able to provide for a detailed explanation of the initiative today
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.5733594298362732;what we would like to do is to ensure that the necessary structural measures within the banking system to a certain extent also between the national central banks of the eurosystem and the banking system are taken so as to lower the costs but also to increase the efficiency of the system to increase the speed of payments and so on
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.5564904808998108;it is not intended to fix the final costs and the financial relations between customers and banks  we think that it is the market that must provide for that  but to ensure that a maximum of efficiency and flexibility as well as competition between banks on that very issue does exist or is improved
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9704862833023071;so we will give details on that
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9661393165588379;we are not going to publish the amounts of fees or to give instructions to banks to change their fees and cut them by x or y but to ensure that all the banks take the necessary steps to progressively provide for the same sort of service in terms of availability quickness of delivery of payments and costs between countries that they are performing internally today
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9618009924888611;that it is the objective
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8917443752288818;question the ecb has already said that it can deal withany liquidity crisis coming at the end of the year
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9586299061775208;does that mean that the year 2000 would play no role in the timing of a rate decision a rate change
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.832342803478241;duisenberg they will not
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Negative;0.5446706414222717;question year 2000 issues will not play a role
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8480376601219177;duisenbergno we have not said that we can deal with any liquidity crisis as you formulated it
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.7900104522705078;we can deal with an increased demand for liquidity that may arise
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Negative;0.905613362789154;we do not think that the public at large should be worried at all but we cannot help it if the public at large is worried and thus asked for greater liquidity
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9650443196296692;in that case we can through the banks and directly handle any increased demand for liquidity that might arise
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8501821756362915;question would this mean that if you would be making your decisions on interest rates towards the end of the year you really need not take into account any sort of liquidity problems
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9752683639526367;duisenberg i do not think that interest rate policies would have an impact on the effects or the anticipated effects of the century date change
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9000675678253174;question i think my colleagues question was the other way round
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9129370450973511;the liquidity squeeze or the possibility of thereof would have an impact on your decisionmaking regarding interest rates
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8323113322257996;in other words economists say that central banks generally not only the ecb will have a short a brief window only left this year  now open  before they cannot move rates anymore because liquidity would be a problem and thus the decision regarding interest rates is limited towards the end of the year
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8936087489128113;noyer no just to build on what the president has said
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9554529190063477;you must bear in mind that there are two differences between the situation let us say in the united states  i am just taking this as an example and could be any other large economy  and in europe
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9778904318809509;the two differences are first concerning the banknotes because the ncbs are now printing euro banknotes they have accumulated a stock of national banknotes to cover the period between now and the year 2000 so we actually have far more banknotes in the vaults than central banks would normally have
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9860029220581055;these stocks enable us to provide for liquidity in banknotes to a much larger extent than normal so that in practice everything is as if we had prepared for a special event
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9551295638084412;but the event we have been preparing for was of course different
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9725332856178284;but it can also be used for that purpose
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9782592058181763;the second difference in our monetary policy implementation framework there is a facility that does not exist in most of the other monetary policy frameworks around the world which is what we call the marginal lending facility
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9829397201538086;through the marginal lending facility if there are unexpected needs on a given day or at a given time of day from the banking system that have not been covered through tenders all the banks may immediately come to the eurosystem and take all the liquidity they need
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.876657247543335;i mean there is no ceiling to that
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9033886790275574;they can take everything they need whenever they need it that is on 31 december or 30 december that is no problem
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8439134955406189;the only question mark was is there enough collateral
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9035205245018005;as you know very well looking at the tenders the amount of collateral is far far higher than that which is actually used both for payment systems and for monetary policy operations
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.5215033888816833;so they could increase their liquidity value on any given day by a very high factor
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.911950409412384;so these specific features are the fundamental reason why we say that there is no problem with liquidity
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9753931164741516;and having said that you can also see that it is not related to the interest rate policy conducted because the marginal lending facility works whatever the interest rate for this facility may be
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8843310475349426;the cost for 24 hours or even a few days is really of minor importance
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8112064599990845;question just finally since you had the general council meeting today as well in other words eddie george was here
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9596085548400879;britain raised the interest rates yesterday
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9466460943222046;did you discuss the rate hike in britain yesterday and does it have any impact on the ecbs thinking on monetary policy
1999-09-09;1999;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8859938383102417;duisenberg he was here i can confirm that
