1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9777612686157227;although the lower effective exchange rate of the euro and the rise in oil prices may lead to some upward pressure on headline hicp inflation in the coming months the current economic situation is likely to contribute to containing this upward pressure

1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Negative;0.6216911673545837;well it is still falling not only against the dollar but also against the pound sterling and i am wondering if you are concerned now and if not why not
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.8945218920707703;duisenberg i should like to contradict you with respect to your last statement
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Negative;0.43977662920951843;over the past few days the euro has been strengthening

1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.8556278347969055;question one month ago when you cut the interest rates you mentioned that that was it
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9884995818138123;now we have heard some positive signs from the real economy
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9160026907920837;are you more convinced that we are now at the turning point in interest rates so that the falling trend has finished
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9165543913841248;duisenberg let me only say that in todays statement which reflects the decision of the governing council this is still it
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.7298758625984192;question in the last week or so in line with this speakingwithonevoice idea we have seen ecb officials taking a stronger line on saying that the euro can only fall so far
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9005276560783386;did you all make a decision to start speaking somewhat differently
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.8643684983253479;duisenberg no we did not speak differently
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Negative;0.951758623123169;but we were somewhat concerned that it had been alluded in the european parliament that we were following a policy of neglect visÃ vis the euro so that we deliberately wanted to contradict that
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9165990352630615;we are not by any means neglecting the exchange rate of the euro
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9726364612579346;we regard the exchange rate as one of the main indicators we follow in assessing the outlook for price movements and price stability over the medium term
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9624972343444824;so that is what we discussed and what we decided to emphasise which is not a change of policy only a confirmation of policy which apparently did not come across sufficiently well
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Negative;0.6412789821624756;question i understand that just over an hour ago before the press conference mr rojo one of the council members effectively leaked todays interest rate decision to the press
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9827874898910522;he was reported as saying that you left interest rates unchanged
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9599782824516296;are you aware of that and do you think that this is an appropriate way for information to be released
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.6136475205421448;duisenberg i am aware of what has been reported
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9314188957214355;i think that if he said that we should ask for some foregiveness in this particular case because it happens that the spokesman you quote is celebrating his 65th birthday today
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.6821103692054749;question have you intervened in the markets in any way to boost the euro
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.8913240432739258;has the ecb intervened in the markets in any way to boost the euros value

1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9803311228752136;question some ecb watchers consider that within the council of the european central bank there are differences in the emphasis on the value attached to the exchange rate of the euro
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9588695764541626;there are perhaps differences in views slight differences of view between duisenberg and tietmeyer
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.93785560131073;one says a euro is a euro and the other says as long as the stability goal is not endangered the exchange rate does not mean very much
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.936051607131958;are there these differences of view and do they mean anything
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.949120819568634;or are there really differences in view in the european central bank council about the exchange rate of the euro
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9200407862663269;duisenberg if there were different opinions in the council i would not tell you about it
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9618890285491943;but i can tell you that of course all these matters are subject of discussion
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9758948683738708;and in all cases in our history which is admittedly not a long history we have easily been able to reach a consensus about our views and of course sometimes someone enters the discussion with a view which may differ from the view that is being held at the end of the discussion
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9723621606826782;there is no way to define or discover at least i could not do that a split in thinking or differences of views which are of any significance
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9790883660316467;question this afternoon when the ecb made its normal statement about interest rates to news agencies it did not mention the number of weeks that the securities refinancing rate would be conducted at 25 percent
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.8789089918136597;will it be done for the next two weeks as it has been in the past or was this an intentional omission
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9288912415504456;noyer no it was not an omission
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9827965497970581;normally we simply mentioned the number of weeks between two council meetings
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9456080198287964;there is no particular intention behind that
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.969769299030304;that will be for the next two weeks yes
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.7898984551429749;question we heard from the german government that savings are going to be applied only from 2000 generally speaking we see that all of the governments are starting to look more at the war in kosovo than at controlling their expenditure
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9541417360305786;do you think confidence is declining
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Negative;0.8600818514823914;do you think that this is also a major danger for the euro the fact that these reforms are just being put off and put off and nobody seems to apply them
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.8871421813964844;duisenberg it is too early to assess the impact of a conflict that has not yet ended on future budgetary developments
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9646041989326477;we are actively studying that
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Negative;0.514071524143219;but it is too early still to come to conclusions
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.8170143961906433;for the time being we do not think that it should nor that it will have a significant impact on budgetary developments
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.5850919485092163;in the future it might lead to a rearrangement of priorities within budgets
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9205278158187866;i do not exclude that
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9315693974494934;but as for the impact on the euro as you have mentioned it it is true to say that the news that comes by the hour on the conflict in yugoslavia has an impact on the volatility of the euro
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.983730137348175;just when i was entering this room there was a statement by the vicepresident of the united states which immediately caused the euro to lose a couple of hundredths of a percent but then maybe there already is another statement which goes in the other direction
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Negative;0.8706251978874207;so the volatility has increased
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Negative;0.7357540130615234;we believe it is too early to assess what the basic reasons are that the euro has been let me call it recovering so strongly in the last few days
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9841246604919434;question at the start of the year you were expressing some concern about the level of fiscal discipline used by governments in the euro zone
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Negative;0.5539883375167847;have you seen any signs of improvements in that area
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.6533557176589966;do you think that there is a greater understanding now of the need for budgetary discipline and also for structural reforms and labour and product markets
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Negative;0.47141602635383606;duisenberg excluding as i just did the war from those considerations we have not yet seen signs of a significant improvement of let me call them the fiscal authorities
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Negative;0.8323436379432678;now that we know all the stabilisation programmes which have been introduced or published we see an only moderate further decline in public deficits across euroland  very moderate on average  which still leaves the combined deficit for euroland in the year 2001 or 2002 at a level above that which is called for by the stability and growth pact
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9897869825363159;so in that sense our concerns have not diminished

1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.7241679430007935;so we have decided to wait and gain a little more experience before making a final assessment on that
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9544973969459534;for the time being we think that it could very well be that the allotment ratio will come up again to a certain point of equilibrium but it is not possible to make a final judgement
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.861138641834259;question i wonder and despite the fact that the ecb does not feel competent to speak on fiscal policy i wonder if you see any role at all for the central bank in helping mr prodi organise matters at the brussels level in terms of the fiscal side specifically the european commission
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9871219992637634;you know yourself about the paris proposals for boosting the role of the european commission in the fiscal debate and of course it goes together with the policy mix in which the ecb is of course one of the actors
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9688374400138855;is there any role therefore for the ecb in helping mr prodi organise or advising him in any way on how to organise the brussels commission
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9481920599937439;duisenberg the specific question being the last one how to organise the european commission
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9603185057640076;there is no role for the ecb in that respect
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.8783212900161743;question mr president i would appreciate it if you could comment on the wage developments in europe some of the wage increases especially in germany
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9002686738967896;have you any opinion on these developments
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9876558780670166;duisenberg there is of course only incidental information across euroland about the areas in which wage contracts have been concluded
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9877306818962097;at an earlier stage we already indicated that there were instances where wage settlements seem to have been concluded well in excess of the likely rise in productivity and that itself is one of the risks we see for the future
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9832565188407898;but it is not enough of a risk to make us concerned about the future inflationary developments
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.5638941526412964;otherwise we would not have lowered the interest rates a few weeks ago

1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.5186819434165955;does that mean you actually have a tightening bias at this point and also in light of your saying that there is a moderate bettering of the current condition
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9016966223716736;duisenberg no i know that every word i say is being interpreted differently by different people
1999-05-06;1999;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9296847581863403;so i can only emphasise that in my words and in my thinking there is no bias
