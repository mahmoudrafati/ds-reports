1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9636868834495544;let me start with the governing councils discussion on recent economic developments and the decisions that the governing council has taken today in the field of monetary policy
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9546740055084229;at todays meeting the governing council reviewed the latest monetary financial and economic developments

1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9672382473945618;they will be fixed rate tenders conducted at an interest rate of 30
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9802401661872864;in addition the interest rate on the marginal lending facility continues to be 45 and the interest rate on the deposit facility remains 20
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9840264320373535;let me report in more detail on the governing councils deliberations and thereby provide the explanations for the decisions which were taken today
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9848532676696777;on 1 february 1999 we released the latest data on monetary developments in the euro area
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Positive;0.4048076272010803;these data confirmed the continuation of a favourable outlook for price stability in the euro area
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9883375763893127;the latest threemonth moving average of annual m3 growth rates covering the period from october to december 1998 was 47
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9907546639442444;this result was unchanged from the average over the period from september to november 1998 and remained very close to the reference value for broad money growth of 4½ set by the governing council
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Positive;0.8000826835632324;developments in the narrow aggregate m1 have been more buoyant recently
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Negative;0.937024712562561;similarly the growth of credit to the private sector continued to be high in december 1998 these developments seem to reflect in particular the current low levels of interest rates in the euro area
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9626467823982239;although they are not considered by the governing council to imply inflationary risks at this juncture in particular the developments in credit growth will need to be carefully monitored in the coming months
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Negative;0.8805269002914429;with regard to the broadly based outlook for price developments and risks to price stability in the euro area financial market indicators suggest that market participants continue to expect low inflation
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Negative;0.97890704870224;since early january euro area longterm interest rates have continued to decline and the yield curve has shifted downwards
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9671667814254761;at the same time the latest developments are giving mixed signals as to the evolution of the world economy in 1999 on the one hand recent events in brazil have highlighted the fragility of the current situation in emerging markets while on the other output growth in the united states was much stronger in the last quarter of 1998 than expected
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Negative;0.99080491065979;in the euro area too available indicators continue to suggest a mixed picture
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9902849793434143;according to revised eurostat estimates real gdp growth remained broadly robust in the third quarter of 1998 while in more recent months activity may have slowed down
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9879897236824036;such a slowdown is apparent in industrial production growth up to november 1998 in particular in the intermediate goods sector which is particularly sensitive to any deterioration in the external environment
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Positive;0.5713779330253601;however at the same time production of capital goods and consumer durables has continued to expand rather strongly
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Negative;0.7641972303390503;a similar pattern can be observed in the decline in industrial confidence that has been apparent in the second half of 1998 in the euro area while however stabilising in january 1999 on the other hand consumer confidence in the euro area continued to increase in december and in january it has now exceeded the peak level reached in 1990 with retail sales up to november showing continued solid growth and car sales growing strongly during the last months of 1998 finally the mixed picture is confirmed by other data
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Positive;0.6085184812545776;order books which overall declined slightly further in december apparently increased again in january particularly with respect to export orders
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9923388957977295;capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector which started to decrease in the third quarter recovered again thereafter while december data on unemployment appear to suggest that the decline in unemployment rates stalled around yearend
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9950578212738037;therefore with regard to the cyclical situation recent data seem to confirm our earlier assessment that there are downside risks for output growth and that production may have slowed down around the turn of the year
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9860867261886597;nonetheless in the opinion of the governing council there are also no clear signals as yet of a stronger than expected weakening in output growth
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9855756759643555;given the mixed picture outlined above the governing council emphasised that further thorough analysis and very close monitoring of underlying trends are needed before any conclusions can be drawn concerning the broad outlook for 1999 and 2000 with regard to the latest data on the harmonised index of consumer prices the annual increase for december 1998 showed a further slowdown to 08 compared with 09 in november and 10 in october
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9806063771247864;this development was in line with previous trends ie
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9807485342025757;it was due mainly to a further reduction in energy prices and also in december to a decline in the price increases in nonenergy industrial goods
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9364506602287292;taking a forwardlooking perspective the general environment continues to suggest that there are no significant upward or downward pressures on prices in the short term
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9865004420280457;furthermore the pattern of risks to price stability has remained broadly unchanged
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9837733507156372;on the one hand downward risks could materialise if import or producer prices were to fall further
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9887104630470276;on the other given current wage demands wage developments especially when measured in real terms could become a matter of concern and fiscal policies would also pose a threat to the favourable outlook for prices and growth and employment prospects if the credibility of the stability and growth pact were undermined
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9857552647590637;in addition exchange rate trends need to be monitored closely given their importance for domestic price developments
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9885170459747314;in conclusion taking into account the latest evidence available the governing council has not altered its assessment of the outlook for price developments
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9893621802330017;the governing council therefore decided to keep ecb interest rates unchanged at the levels currently prevailing
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Negative;0.7858266234397888;i should like to take this opportunity to recall that real threemonth interest rates if measured as nominal rates corrected for current hicp inflation as a very incomplete proxy stood at a level of 23 in january this is approximately 80 basis points lower than the level one year ago
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9718310832977295;at the same time real longterm interest rates measured on a similar basis have reached a level of 30 which is around 110 basis points lower than in early 1998 these levels are very low both in comparison with other countries and with historical data for the euro area
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9640680551528931;monetary and financial conditions therefore support continued economic growth in the euro area in line with price stability
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9796079397201538;i should now like to inform you about some other matters considered by the governing council
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9874790906906128;the endofday procedures relating to target and access to the eurosystems standing facilities were reviewed by governing council today
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9901782274246216;the governing council agreed that from tomorrow on the deadline for requesting access to the marginal lending facility will coincide with the deadline for access to the deposit facility ie
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.972459077835083;30 minutes after the actual closing time of target
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9325668811798096;furthermore the deadlines for requesting access to the eurosystems standing facilities will be postponed by an additional 30 minutes on the last eurosystem business day of a minimum reserve maintenance period
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9688345193862915;as a final point i should like to inform you that the ecb is planning an information campaign with regard to the launch of the euro banknotes on 1 january 2002 one of our aims in undertaking such an exercise will be to ensure that by the time the euro banknotes become available every person using and handling them will be fully acquainted with their features to the extent that everyone will be able to identify the banknotes as being genuine
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9853602051734924;in this respect the ecb will be cooperating with the european commission and the member states to ensure that there will be no duplication of effort
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9318070411682129;we are now at your disposal should you have any questions
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9816354513168335;transcript of the questions asked and the answers given by dr willem f duisenberg president of the ecb and christian noyer vicepresident of the ecb question  this extension of the period of access to the marginal lending facility
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8755168318748474;what is that for
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9797549247741699;duisenbergthat is because in practice the banks throughout the euro area still very much bunch their payment orders together at the very end of the day
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Negative;0.8223440051078796;that makes it difficult for them precisely to know what their liquidity situation will be overnight
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9705119132995605;it is only after they have finally bunched all their orders together very much towards the closing time of target that they know precisely what liquidity needs or surpluses they may have
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8775335550308228;we have therefore given them an extra half hour so as to make life easier for our counterparties and participants in the payment system to settle their accounts
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9078074097633362;question mr duisenberg i have a serious problem with your assessment of prices  no upward or downward pressure
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9546314477920532;you have now been saying this for the past 68 weeks
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9812926650047302;if you draw a line of consumer prices since 1993 it goes from the top left to the bottom right fairly consistently
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Negative;0.8700639009475708;of course it has been dropping faster since commodity and food prices began really to dive in 1997 however does the ecb really consider that the zero line on the euro and the euro basis is some kind of floor for prices or does it not consider that there is indeed downward pressure and the evidence of the last six years might suggest that this is the case
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9394296407699585;duisenberg when you look in particular at the causes of this consistent decline in the rate of increase of inflation i have pointed repeatedly over the last months to the figures which were available for this
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Negative;0.96993488073349;there was the fall in energy prices
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Negative;0.8687431216239929;in itself we believe that to be a temporary factor
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9663001298904419;this persistent decline must come to an end at some point
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9366261959075928;and then if we try to measure the underlying rate of inflation the core rate of inflation  which is difficult in the various countries it is somewhat easier to measure  then you will come to considerably higher figures of price increases
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8231528997421265;question how much lower will the euro have to fall for an intervention on the part of the european central bank if any
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8334561586380005;duisenberg if any i do not know
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9367226362228394;only if the euro were thought to be seriously out of line in view of the fundamental factors visàvis other countries might there be a need for a desirability of intervention but i would not put a timeframe on it
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Negative;0.6535679697990417;at the moment it is certainly not the case
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8717641234397888;question i would like to follow up on the question with respect to target
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8171733617782593;could you tell us a little more about the problems that occurred at the end of last week at banque de france and probably about any compensation for the banks that suffered from the breakdown of target
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9719271659851074;duisenberg at the banque de france last friday while major work was being executed on their system there was a technical failure of a computer actually a hard disk in the computer of the backup system literally broke
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Negative;0.8905013203620911;that caused a problem in the settlement in target towards the end of friday
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.6023281812667847;it had the result that certain payments large amounts of certain banks could either not be paid or not be received so that those institutions were compelled to take recourse to the lending or the deposit facility
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9685131311416626;it has been decided  the problems have in the meantime been overcome  it has been decided by the governing council today that those institutions which are said or claim to have suffered from this because they were forced to borrow at a higher rate than otherwise would have been the case will be compensated in principle by charging them the eonia rate the overnight interest rate for the amounts concerned and not the rate of the marginal lending facility
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9880638718605042;it will quickly be investigated by the banque de france in close consultation with the european central bank to ensure a harmonised approach across the euro areawide target system
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9758481979370117;we expect that everything will be settled within one months time
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.7018376588821411;question there has been some speculation this week particularly in italy that the ecb might eventually tend to favour a variable rate tender
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9650858044624329;i know you do not want to indicate any specifics but could you just tell us what your basic feelings are about a variable rate tender
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8675671219825745;the bundesbank had favoured that as a matter of principle
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8827008605003357;is that something that you fundamentally would advocate
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9585727453231812;duisenberg it is something i would not fundamentally oppose and it will come some day but not yet
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9274435043334961;questionthis is a sort of a general question
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.6953904628753662;what do you think if there would be any factor which could endanger the stability of the euro any challenging factor in the future undermining the stability of the euro could you comment on that please
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9362577199935913;duisenberg i cannot think of any factor that could undermine this strong currency
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.96977698802948;question translation mr president the g7 countries will be meeting on 20 february in bonn and you have been invited to attend
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.7618002891540527;are there any special matters you as an observer would like this conference to deal with in view of the still ongoing debate on a reform of the global financial system a new architecture and what points would you raise as being most urgent
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9813093543052673;duisenberg i will participate in the g7 meeting for certain agenda points
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9082120656967163;it is not yet entirely clear what will be on the agenda
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9759517908096313;presumably we will talk about exchange rates and certain regimes that one could envisage for exchange rates
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9433937072753906;and in that context the ecb will not be in favour of any particular regime on exchange rates which could force it to put aside the primary objective which the ecb is pursuing namely internal price stability
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.6299313306808472;question hello mr duisenberg
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.709430456161499;a couple of questions please
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.7793828248977661;i would like to ask one more about the dollar
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Negative;0.7540554404258728;european exporters have been quite pleased the last couple of weeks with the strength in the dollar and a little bit of weakness in the euro
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8660873770713806;how do you proceed that
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8691543936729431;have you been pleased with the eurodollar rates the past week
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9431732892990112;duisenberg we have discussed the developments and we have concluded that the developments over the past few weeks in which the euro has moved from us 116 to us 113 today that that is a matter of puzzlement
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.883744478225708;that is one thing we try to explain why it has happened
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9519714713096619;we can think of partial reasons but also that it is not a matter of concern
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Negative;0.6762516498565674;question you say not a matter of concern
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Negative;0.6583269238471985;is that something you would have like to see a little bit of strengthening in the dollar
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9300699830055237;duisenberg we are also in a learning process
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9115036129951477;i mean these girations in the exchange rate in the past for the dollar they have been very very much larger than what we have seen now
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8690831065177917;and we also have to get used to the fact that the impact of exchange rate variations on the euro area as a whole is far less marked than in the past
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9920462369918823;the movements in the exchange rates would have an impact on the individual countries with exports representing only about 10 of the euro area as such
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.976659893989563;the euro area very much approaches the idea of a relatively closed economy
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9823306798934937;and so well i often say it like this if you ask a european what does the euro do he will answer well today it was us 113 yesterday it was us 114
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9746682643890381;he will give you a precise answer
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9019726514816284;if you ask an american what does the dollar do

1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8863226771354675;question i would really like to ask you one more question if i could
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9886115193367004;the us economy grew much more strongly than people had expected in the fourth quarter
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9933521747589111;and there is some concern that it would have not grown the effects that it would have on the global economy
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8564606308937073;i am just wondering there are some economists who think now that if the us continues to grow strongly that that could have an effect on how you the ecb would conduct of monetary policy
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Positive;0.8099936842918396;what effects do you see in europe on a strong us economy
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Negative;0.6861356496810913;duisenberg i only see favourable effects if the us economy were to remain that strong
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Positive;0.5150420665740967;but then we also realise that this indeed surprisingly strong performance of the us economy may in part be attributed to temporary factors
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9864972233772278;in the fourth quarter they had  although they have had some snow thereafter exceptionally good weather in the united states which is favourable for output growth
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9146476984024048;one has to realise that some effects may also have come from the ending of the general motors strike and by definition these are temporary factors
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Positive;0.6358026266098022;so there are some temporary elements in this strong performance which we also take into account
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Negative;0.35714229941368103;but on the whole the developments of the united states economy in the fourth quarter have had and will have a favourable positive impact also on developments in europe
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.5784986019134521;questionmr president you said well only intervene on currency markets if the euro is fundamentally misaligned
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9809462428092957;now what exactly do you mean by that what eurodollar rate would you mean  what would be roughly the rate at which you would intervene
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8801795244216919;i presume that would mean that the fundamentals were out of line
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9447276592254639;and another question were there other important points that you discussed today that you would like to inform us of
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9525601863861084;duisenbergwell i wouldnt like to engage in speculation is the presidents answer
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9145748019218445;and if i were to answer your questions i would be engaging in speculation so i wont
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.863558292388916;questionand the other question
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9560885429382324;are there other important issues that you discussed in the governing council today that you would wish to inform us of
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9541447758674622;duisenberg no i think i have given you a full and comprehensive view of what we discussed today
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8892533779144287;question i have two questions one is would you be able to give a short comment on todays rate decision by the bank of england and by the danish central bank which lowered the rates today and the second question concerns the euro zone money market which is currently trading well above the repo rate
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9180120825767517;are you satisfied with this development on the money market at the moment or is there something that you would like to be improved in the course of the next weeks
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.6163820028305054;duisenberg well on the last question we are satisfied with the developments in the money market
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Negative;0.7793535590171814;and the transition to a truly integrated money market across the euro area has been rather swift and smooth
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.6324315667152405;we are satisfied with that
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.6077896356582642;on the interest rate moves of other countries i cannot comment with the exception that as the danish governor told me truly it has become possible for the danes to lower their official rates partly as a result of the successful launch of the euro
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9698193073272705;and the successful developments of the euro and in the euro area have certainly contributed to the success of the monetary policy in denmark
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.6288449764251709;question you have been talking today about fiscal policy in italy which has been warned by the commission about the deficit goal just this week
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.965183436870575;what point will monetary policy have to counterbalance like fiscal policy in countries within euroland what are the boundaries that you see before you would act
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.7875038385391235;duisenberg well mr noyer has participated in the discussion about italy and i am sure that he will not tell you anything about their discussion despite the leaks that have come out of brussels 
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9787253737449646;noyer no i think that is very much the responsibility of the commission to make the proposal for the assessment of the stability programmes proposed by governments
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9641883969306946;the fact that we are invited to take part in the discussion will certainly not lead us to leak anything of what any assessment could have been
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9001613259315491;what we could simply say is that precise execution of the stability and growth pact is an important element in the global assessment by the ecb of the balance of risks
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9045704007148743;if there was a development that would strongly deviate from the line in which governments have engaged themselves our global assessment would have to take that into account but we cannot say more today
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9594029784202576;question but does that mean that they would have to go to the edges of the stability and growth pact boundaries before you would act or would you step in before that
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Negative;0.5118551254272461;noyer what i mean is simply that for the time being what we have taken into account for the foreseeable future for the years to come was the fact that governments have committed themselves to the stability and growth pact
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9812264442443848;and this is an important element taking a mediumterm perspective of the likely developments in the euro area
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9385382533073425;now we of course consider that normally this should be implemented and that this factor is well known
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8577937483787537;but i dont want to comment further
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9844937324523926;there is no special new assessment that the ecb would like to give today about what are or are not the monetary stances of countries
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9378552436828613;duisenberg and then you have to realise that the discussion which takes place about these things in the economic and financial committee is not a discussion which itself would lead or has to lead to action
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9872592091560364;it is a discussion to prepare the ministers who will meet to discuss the same subject next monday and they will take action
1999-02-04;1999;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9288045763969421;ladies and gentlemen this is the end of the press conference
