2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9855715036392212;since then incoming information had confirmed that the euro area economic recovery was continuing and there was good evidence that the monetary policy measures in place were working
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9862434267997742;however downside risks had increased again since the beginning of the current year amid heightened uncertainty about the growth prospects of emerging market economies volatility in financial markets and geopolitical risks

2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9936615228652954;inflation had continued to be weaker than expected mainly owing to the renewed sharp fall in oil prices but also to persistently subdued underlying price pressures
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9880638718605042;weaker than anticipated growth in wages in conjunction with declining inflation expectations could also signal increased risks of secondround effects
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9953355193138123;at the same time financial market conditions in the euro area had clearly deteriorated since the early december governing council meeting although the magnitude and persistence of these developments were still uncertain

2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9895839095115662;in the meantime work needed to be carried out to ensure that all technical conditions were in place to allow the full range of policy options to be available for implementation if needed and to assess the effectiveness of potential measures
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9817551374435425;moreover to strengthen the language on the readiness to act if needed but also to offset some of the tightening of financial conditions that had been observed since the december monetary policy meeting the governing council could reaffirm its forward guidance on interest rates highlighting that it expected its key policy rates to remain at current or lower levels for an extended period of time
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9878219962120056;2 governing councils discussion and monetary policy decisions economic and monetary analyses with regard to the economic analysis members broadly supported the assessment of the outlook and risks for euro area economic activity as provided by mr praet in his introduction
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9947010278701782;recent data confirmed that the economic recovery was proceeding supported mainly by resilient domestic demand but faced with growing uncertainty about the global economic outlook
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9945740103721619;risks were considered to remain on the downside and related in particular to heightened volatility in financial and commodity markets and increased uncertainty about the economic outlook for emerging market economies
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9703949093818665;while some recent hard data had been slightly below expectations employment growth had remained robust and some sentiment indicators had surprised on the upside showing some resilience to the heightened global uncertainty
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9642479419708252;overall these recent data suggested that real gdp growth in the fourth quarter of 2015 and in the first quarter of 2016 was still expected to be close to the level foreseen in the december 2015 eurosystem staff projections and to remain above estimates of potential growth
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9734528064727783;the impact of the recent sharp decline in energy prices on the outlook for euro area economic activity was highlighted
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9883713126182556;lower energy prices were generally considered to be a supporting factor for euro area demand growth in particular through their positive impact on household real disposable income and corporate profits
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9854846596717834;however it was also cautioned that from a general equilibrium perspective the recent decline in oil prices had to be seen against a backdrop of a slowdown in global growth and heightened volatility and uncertainty hence the net impact could be less positive
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9933401942253113;looking at the medium term the baseline scenario for real gdp growth in the euro area was generally considered to have remained broadly unchanged
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Positive;0.96250319480896;in addition to the impact of lower energy prices the recovery was expected to continue to be supported by the monetary policy measures taken by the ecb since mid2014 and their passthrough to lending conditions for households and firms as well as by a slightly accommodative fiscal stance
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9951327443122864;concerns were nevertheless expressed that some of the downside risks to growth as identified in the previous monetary policy meeting in particular related to emerging market economies had already partly materialised and were likely to affect negatively the outlook for euro area growth
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9915960431098938;attention was also drawn to the continuing or even deepening dichotomy between relatively resilient domestic demand and weakening external demand
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9506296515464783;looking ahead it remained to be seen whether robust growth in domestic demand could continue to offset weakness in external demand
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9946475625038147;commenting in more detail on the outlook for external demand concerns were expressed that global economic growth and global trade growth were decelerating in a context of heightened volatility in global financial and commodity markets and weaker global confidence
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9921324849128723;the environment had deteriorated in emerging market economies in particular
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9904645681381226;the recent volatility in emerging market financial conditions including sharp declines in local stock and bond markets was partly related to expectations of a more pronounced slowdown in these economies
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9785680174827576;in china the ongoing economic rebalancing which was in itself desirable and in line with past calls from the international community could turn out to be more pronounced than expected and trigger a hard landing
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9643036723136902;in addition global geopolitical uncertainties remained elevated and had increased further since the december 2015 monetary policy meeting in particular in the middle east

2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9885215759277344;in particular employment data pointed to continued robustness of the us economic recovery
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9851877689361572;at the same time the recent improvements in us employment appeared to be largely concentrated in low wage segments of the labour force and could therefore have a limited impact on disposable income and consumption notwithstanding a relatively higher propensity of low wage earners to consume
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9911683797836304;additional factors weighing on us growth were the nominal effective appreciation of the us dollar and the uncertainty regarding the outcome of the us presidential elections
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9498518705368042;some market economists had recently started to discuss the possibility of a recession in the united states during 2016 euro area net export demand was also seen to be influenced by developments in the euro exchange rate
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9851378202438354;since the last monetary policy meeting the euro exchange rate had been relatively stable against the us dollar but it had appreciated against other currencies in particular those of emerging market economies
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9935322999954224;relevant factors in this context were heightened uncertainties about emerging market developments and potential changes in monetary policy expectations across the globe as well as idiosyncratic factors such as market concerns about a brexit and its impact on the pound sterling
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9495050311088562;turning to euro area domestic demand relatively resilient private consumption was seen as the main driver of growth in the period ahead
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9929185509681702;real disposable income was benefiting from low inflation and favourable terms of trade effects following the sharp decline in oil prices as well as from improvements in labour market conditions
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.649383544921875;in addition euro area households appeared to have a relatively high propensity to use their recent real disposable income gains for consumption as suggested by the broad stability of the household savings rate observed over past quarters
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9927372336387634;at the same time it was flagged that low inflation and high real incomes could in turn lead to lower wage demands and could thus dampen the growth of real disposable income in the period ahead thereby acting as a drag on consumption
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9929337501525879;data on investment growth were generally considered to remain weak
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Positive;0.6148463487625122;concerning business investment it was argued that the conditions for a pickup were largely in place as external borrowing costs were low and ample internal financing was available
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9907608032226562;the latter was supported by the recent recovery in profit margins and by the increasing net lending position of the nonfinancial corporate sector reflecting the excess of strong savings over weak investment which was unusual at the current stage of the economic recovery
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9910464882850647;furthermore advances in structural reforms across the euro area should be laying the foundation for future investment growth
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9948304295539856;nevertheless despite these favourable conditions private investors still appeared to be cautious possibly owing to uncertainty and the subdued outlook for potential growth
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.6342734098434448;with regard to public investment it was remarked that national authorities were making insufficient use of available fiscal space to increase public investment

2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Negative;0.7971872091293335;overall the risks to the outlook for economic growth were generally seen as remaining tilted to the downside and as having increased since the december 2015 monetary policy meeting
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Negative;0.5034722089767456;risks mainly stemmed from the external environment and included the possibility of a stronger than expected slowdown in global growth in particular in emerging market economies and of renewed increases in financial and commodity market volatility
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9948030114173889;concerns were voiced that the policy space was relatively limited at the global level to counter a scenario of a protracted growth slowdown accompanied by market instability
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9577993750572205;at the same time it was also highlighted that emerging market economies still had a wide array of available instruments to counter any further deterioration in economic or financial conditions
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Negative;0.6247690320014954;views were exchanged on the resilience of the euro area to potential negative shocks from the global economy
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9491477608680725;on the one hand the euro area had thus far demonstrated a relatively high degree of resilience as reflected in confidence indicators available up to the yearend
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9297332763671875;on the other hand euro area financial markets had been affected by the recent increase in global risk aversion and some concern was voiced that global shocks could again have different effects on the financial markets of individual euro area countries
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9490902423858643;members underlined that in order to strengthen the prospects for sustained output growth determined policy action was needed at the national and european levels
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9843191504478455;in particular available fiscal space should be used to promote productive investment and it was important to recall that fiscal consolidation should follow a growthfriendly course
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9837215542793274;a suggestion was made that the relevant authorities could examine the potential for tax shifts away from labour and towards consumption
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9814258813858032;with regard to structural reforms continued progress was seen as important to strengthen potential growth and encourage private investment
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9863828420639038;finally at the european level progress in further deepening governance reforms was flagged as important to bolster confidence and counter potential negative external shocks
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9830801486968994;broad support was expressed for the assessment of the outlook and risks for euro area prices as presented by mr praet in his introduction
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Negative;0.991798996925354;annual hicp inflation was 02 in december 2015 well below the path implied by the december 2015 staff projections mainly owing to a sharp decline in oil prices and lower than expected services price inflation
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9863495230674744;the recent oil price developments were likely to imply a significantly lower path of annual hicp inflation in 2016 which could turn negative for a number of months
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9831472039222717;over the medium term inflation was expected to pick up in line with the baseline scenario of a continued economic recovery
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.7586439251899719;the balance of risks to the inflation outlook was seen as tilted to the downside as the prolonged period of low headline inflation could affect underlying inflation and trigger secondround effects which had to be monitored closely
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9856245517730713;a more complete analysis would become available with the march 2016 ecb staff macroeconomic projections and the quarterly monetary assessment by staff
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9676625728607178;to assess the outlook for prices it was seen as important to better understand the drivers of energy price developments
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9901042580604553;on the one hand it was highlighted that the low price elasticity of oil supply implied that production capacity was not adjusting quickly to lower demand suggesting that a prolonged period of low oil prices or even a further drop could not be ruled out
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9910872578620911;a structural break in the relationship between volumes and prices had been observed which could be due to geopolitical factors the increasing importance of shale oil and the reduced pricing power of opec
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9382774829864502;on the other hand the point was made that the current supply overhang had already started to decline according to some indicators and could dissipate more quickly than expected even if anecdotal evidence of a significant adjustment in investment and employment in the oil industry had not yet appeared to translate into significant supply reductions
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.754652202129364;this implied that a later upward correction could also not be ruled out
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.7650617957115173;finally the question was raised of whether there would be a technical floor to oil prices reflecting cost structures on the supply side
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.7628996968269348;another element requiring further analysis was the impact of persistently low headline inflation on underlying inflation
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9869998097419739;concerns were expressed that measures of underlying inflation had remained subdued and the pickup had stalled since the summer of 2015 this was explained by direct and indirect effects of low energy prices among other factors
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9648709297180176;in the december 2015 hicp data for instance lower than expected services price increases were largely driven by lower transportation costs
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9904852509498596;in the period ahead it was to be expected that such direct and indirect effects of lower energy prices would be further transmitted through various components of the hicp and could thus also have an impact on core inflation
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Positive;0.8879660367965698;at the same time a few arguments were also advanced supporting the relative stability of or a renewed pickup in underlying inflation in the period ahead
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9875307679176331;reference was made to producer price inflation which had rebounded somewhat despite the recent decline in energy prices as well as to the gdp deflator which indicated somewhat higher underlying inflation and suggested upward potential for future hicp inflation if the two measures converged over the medium term as had typically been the case in the past
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9892504215240479;underlying inflation should also recover as the corporate sector regained pricing power over time and further rebuilt margins
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9704620242118835;in addition to the direct and indirect effects of low energy prices members discussed the risk that the protracted period of low headline inflation in the euro area could alter wage dynamics and trigger secondround effects
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Negative;0.687183678150177;on the one hand it was argued that relatively subdued wage growth in recent months should in itself not be taken as direct evidence of secondround effects but could also reflect the lagged impact of past and ongoing necessary adjustments in relative prices and wages across euro area economies to regain competitiveness and support employment
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9561351537704468;in this context wage moderation was seen to reflect the impact of past structural reforms as well as an increased focus by social partners on the need to preserve employment growth which also had to be viewed in conjunction with the associated slowdown in labour productivity that needed to be taken into account in assessing the price outlook
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9754678606987;on the other hand concerns were expressed that recent wage dynamics could point to incipient signs of secondround effects whereby wage dynamics might become increasingly driven by past inflation rates
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9918530583381653;reference was made to evidence from recent wage contracts in one euro area country
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9741135239601135;moreover while recent wagesetting behaviour was still compatible with a range of estimations of the phillips curve it also seemed that outcomes were at the lower end of the spectrum of estimations
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9376410841941833;attention was also drawn to the evolution of inflation expectations which had declined since the last meeting according to both the surveybased measures from the latest round of the spf and marketbased measures as reported in the introductions by mr cœuré and mr praet
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9929592609405518;in this context it was noted that measures of inflation expectations had recently been strongly influenced by oil prices again
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9258347153663635;it was however also recalled that caution was needed when using marketbased measures of inflation expectations as they appeared to be heavily influenced by risk premia and liquidity premia
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9847127199172974;with regard to the monetary analysis members concurred with the assessment presented by mr praet in his introduction
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9885563254356384;broad money m3 had recorded a solid annual growth rate which continued to be mainly supported by its most liquid components
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9896875023841858;recent data were seen to confirm positive signals from monetary developments supported by low opportunity costs and the monetary policy measures in place
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9897776246070862;it was recalled that the analysis undertaken under the monetary pillar traditionally provided information on the outlook for consumer prices but was also relevant for assessing developments in asset prices and residential property prices
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9899188280105591;the dynamics of loans to both nonfinancial corporations and households had firmed further according to the latest data from november 2015 and lending conditions had continued to improve supported by the effective passthrough of the monetary policy measures taken since june 2014 to the cost of borrowing
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9924267530441284;the january 2016 bank lending survey for the euro area pointed to further improvements in demand for bank loans supported by the low level of interest rates financing needs for investment purposes and housing market prospects
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9764085412025452;credit standards had eased further on loans to enterprises notably owing to increasing competitive pressures in retail banking and had reverted to a net easing on loans to households for house purchase
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Positive;0.8664997220039368;it was underlined that credit developments had been on a continuous gradual recovery path since the beginning of 2014 and while money and credit growth were not yet at levels that would signal inflationary pressures indicators were pointing in an upward direction
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9869421124458313;against the background of recent market concerns over parts of some euro area countries banking sectors which might have implications for their lending capacity in the period ahead a remark was made that in large measure these concerns had been triggered by misperceptions about ongoing supervisory activities regarding bank practices for management of nonperforming loans and the banking sectors need to adapt to the new regulatory environment
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8080783486366272;in this context it was seen as important to counter the misperception that this would result in additional provisioning or capital requirements
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9869917631149292;all actors at the european and the national level were called upon to cooperate closely and to communicate clearly in line with the respective responsibilities assigned under the new regulatory and supervisory framework
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9774371385574341;a call was also made for euro area governments to take the necessary steps to achieve the full completion of the banking union
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9881735444068909;in this context it was recalled that the comprehensive assessment in 2014 had been instrumental in identifying and addressing vulnerabilities in the banking sector had helped to build confidence and had strengthened banks balance sheets thereby supporting overall lending conditions and the provision of credit
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Negative;0.5255271792411804;nonetheless it was noted that stock adjustments in financial sector balance sheets related to remaining levels of legacy debt were still ongoing and that the healing of the banking sector would take time to complete
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9884154796600342;monetary policy stance and policy considerations with regard to the monetary policy stance members widely shared the assessment provided by mr praet in his introduction
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9917458891868591;while incoming information had confirmed the ongoing moderate recovery and had provided solid evidence that the monetary policy measures were working as intended downside risks had increased again amid heightened uncertainty about the growth prospects of emerging market economies volatility in the financial and commodity markets and geopolitical risks
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9937893748283386;moreover inflation dynamics had continued to be weaker than expected which in conjunction with declining inflation expectations had increased the risk of secondround effects
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9917215704917908;it was therefore recommended to review and possibly reconsider the monetary policy stance at the next monetary policy meeting in early march when the new ecb staff macroeconomic projections would be available
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.795984148979187;in addition it needed to be reaffirmed that policy rates would remain at current or lower levels for an extended period of time
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9894774556159973;in the meantime work needed to be carried out to ensure that all the technical conditions were in place to make the full range of policy options available for implementation if needed
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9941715598106384;taking stock of the evidence available at the beginning of 2016 members widely agreed that the latest data had been consistent with a continued and effective passthrough of the monetary policy measures that had been adopted since mid2014
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Positive;0.989387035369873;the stimulus introduced had contributed to an improvement in financing conditions and credit provision supporting the real economy and had strengthened the euro areas resilience to recent global economic shocks
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Positive;0.723051905632019;in particular the measures had helped to ease borrowing conditions for the private sector and had promoted loan creation
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9416133165359497;the exchange rate channel was viewed as also playing an important role in the transmission of the monetary policy measures to the broader economy
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9944429993629456;it was noted that more recently however this channel had weakened owing in particular to the depreciation of the currencies of emerging market economies
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9904541969299316;the decisions taken by the governing council in early december 2015 to extend the intended end date of the monthly net asset purchases of 60 billion to at least the end of march 2017 and to reinvest the principal payments on maturing securities for as long as necessary were seen as appropriate
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9734959602355957;reference was made to the figure quoted by the president in his speech in new york in early december whereby the extension of net purchases to at least march 2017 and the reinvestment policy would add about 680 billion in liquidity to the system by 2019 amounting to about twothirds of the original size of the expanded app as decided in january 2015 this would contribute to ample excess liquidity conditions in the euro area money market for an extended period of time and thus strengthen the governing councils forward guidance on interest rates
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9040058255195618;there was broad agreement among members that since that start of the current year downside risks had increased again
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9916040301322937;although the recovery of the euro area economy was holding up well and financing conditions remained favourable overall the external environment was characterised by heightened uncertainty about the growth prospects of emerging market economies volatility in the financial and commodity markets and geopolitical risks
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Negative;0.994599461555481;in this environment euro area inflation dynamics had continued to be weaker than expected
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9827279448509216;there were stronger signs again that repeated downward revisions of the inflation outlook were feeding through to inflation expectations which had again increased the probability of the euro area economy remaining in a low inflation environment for an extended period of time
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9903789758682251;in the light of prevailing uncertainties and volatility members considered it premature to conclude on policy action at the current meeting and to discuss precise policy options that could be taken if needed
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.98843914270401;instead further thorough analysis was required by early march when the new macroeconomic projections including those for 2018 and an updated quarterly monetary assessment would be available from staff
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9581673741340637;the discussion would then benefit from a more comprehensive picture of the economic situation and of the mediumterm price outlook including a deeper analysis of potential secondround effects
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8067919611930847;in this context views were exchanged about the appropriate way of dealing with increased risks and uncertainty
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.950392484664917;the point was made that in a situation in which risks were predominantly on the downside and new downside risks were emerging it would be preferable to act preemptively taking emerging risks into account rather than to wait until after risks had fully materialised
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Negative;0.8618136644363403;however a remark was also made cautioning against adopting an explicit riskbased approach to monetary policy driven mainly by insurance motives given the difficulties in assessing commonly agreeing and communicating on tail risks
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9874984622001648;against this background it was considered necessary to review and possibly reconsider the monetary policy stance at the governing councils next monetary policy meeting in early march as had been suggested by mr praet in his introduction
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9821074604988098;in this context the commitment needed to be reinforced that the governing council was willing and able to take further monetary policy action if warranted reaffirming that the governing council had a broad range of instruments and tools at its disposal
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9906987547874451;in this regard further technical analysis was called for to deepen the governing councils understanding of the effectiveness of the available instruments and to take into account possible side effects
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9904946088790894;it was concluded that work needed to be carried out to ensure that all the technical conditions were in place to make the full range of policy options available for implementation if needed
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9859670996665955;there was wide agreement among members that emphasis needed to be placed on appropriate communication
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9228215217590332;this pertained to conveying the governing councils assessment in a way that avoided complacency on the deteriorating price outlook while also avoiding conveying an unduly gloomy message that in turn could contribute to selffulfilling dynamics
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9655526876449585;the governing council needed to strike a balance between signalling clearly its full capacity willingness and determination to act and at the same time not implying that policy action had already been decided when the economic environment remained very fluid
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9760639667510986;in this regard the presidents new york speech in early december 2015 was mentioned as covering important messages which could become part of a common communication while taking into account changing conditions
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9929916858673096;the governing council needed to reiterate that monetary policy was firmly committed to achieving inflation rates below but close to 2 over the medium term
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9834591746330261;it should emphasise the effectiveness of the instruments that had been activated since mid2014 and recall that a substantial degree of accommodation was still in the pipeline which would take time to fully unfold and pass through to the euro area economy
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Negative;0.6059513688087463;moreover it needed to be reaffirmed that if the governing council had to intensify the use of the available range of policy options in order to achieve its price stability mandate it would not hesitate to do so
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9935470223426819;reassurance needed to be given that the governing council had a variety of instruments at its disposal to respond to circumstances and that there was no limit to how far it was willing to deploy instruments within its mandate to achieve the objective of inflation rates below but close to 2 over the medium term
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9776884317398071;this would help to anchor inflation expectations and underline the significant differences in the monetary policy cycles between major advanced economies
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8164935111999512;at the same time it had to be avoided by means of appropriate communication that markets developed undue or excessive expectations about future policy action bearing in mind the market volatility experienced around the december 2015 monetary policy meeting
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9814702868461609;the ecbs monetary policy should be predictable but  while conveying that the governing council was active and alert  should not be seen as being precommitted or geared to fulfilling prevailing undue market expectations
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9929500818252563;it was underlined that the ecbs monetary policy was data driven and that further analysis and information had to be gathered for a comprehensive review of the monetary policy stance at the governing councils next monetary policy meeting
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9927619099617004;members concurred with mr praet that the forward guidance on interest rates needed to be reaffirmed in the governing councils communication
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9855733513832092;this would reassure markets about the need to maintain the current accommodative monetary policy stance for a long time to come and thereby contribute to ensuring favourable financial conditions beyond the shorter term also supported by the reinvestment policy decided in december 2015 it was therefore agreed to refer again expressly to the forward guidance formulation that had been last used in this form in the presidents introductory statement in may 2014 when the governing council had expected the ecbs key policy rates to remain at current or lower levels for an extended period of time
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9558933973312378;in order to underpin the ecbs commitment to its price stability objective it was seen as warranted to reassert firmly the governing councils faithfulness to its monetary policy strategy and the symmetry of its commitment to do what was necessary to attain its stated aim of achieving hicp inflation rates at levels below but close to 2 over the medium term
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9882382750511169;while inflation could deviate from this aim owing to shortterm developments and economic shocks more lasting deviations could be misinterpreted as a lack of willingness to act or as a lack of effectiveness of monetary policy
2016-02-18;2016;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9422288537025452;a view was put forward in this regard that in order to counter misperceptions of an asymmetric interpretation and to underline the symmetry of the ecbs mandate it appeared logical from a mediumterm perspective for the governing council after a prolonged period of undershooting of its inflation aim to consider a limited period of overshooting in future
