2016-08-18;2016;August;REPORT;Negative;0.4971022307872772;one factor underpinning consumption was the favourable development in household disposable income in part owing to employment growth which continued to be relatively strong in most euro area economies particularly in services
2016-08-18;2016;August;REPORT;Positive;0.9846893548965454;over time investment should also be supported by favourable financing conditions and a recovery in profits
2016-08-18;2016;August;REPORT;Positive;0.8593873381614685;all in all the euro area recovery seemed to remain on track
2016-08-18;2016;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9943689703941345;in particular it was noted that the resilience of domestic demand had shielded the euro area from the recent global slowdown and that there was little evidence that this resilience had weakened
2016-08-18;2016;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9743946194648743;nevertheless there was wide agreement that downside risks to the economic outlook for the euro area had increased mainly owing to the outcome of the uk referendum
2016-08-18;2016;August;REPORT;Negative;0.7460687756538391;in this respect available estimates of the impact on euro area growth over the coming years were noted but it was also recognised that such estimates were subject to a great deal of uncertainty and that the situation called for caution in assessing future developments
2016-08-18;2016;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.5888474583625793;at the same time it was perceived that the reaction of financial markets in the euro area had been more contained than could have been expected both in the initial responses and in the partial reversals that took place afterwards
2016-08-18;2016;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9912501573562622;members remarked that the uncertainty following the uk referendum was in large part of a political nature and due to the lack of clarity about the new relationship between the united kingdom and the rest of the european union in the aftermath of the referendum

2016-08-18;2016;August;REPORT;Negative;0.931554913520813;the main factor driving headline inflation up had been the energy component as the impact of past decreases in oil prices was fading away
2016-08-18;2016;August;REPORT;Negative;0.8848326206207275;these base effects were expected to lead to a significant increase in headline inflation towards the end of 2016 as regards underlying inflation signals had been mixed while services price inflation had risen slightly prices of nonenergy industrial goods had surprised on the downside
2016-08-18;2016;August;REPORT;Positive;0.9906664490699768;looking beyond the end of this year inflation was expected to increase further over the coming years owing to stronger domestic demand tighter labour markets and improvements in corporate profitability supported by the passthrough of the ecbs monetary policy measures
2016-08-18;2016;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9601381421089172;one element in the price outlook that members felt required further analysis was the divergent development of longterm inflation expectations depending on whether they were extracted from surveys or marketbased
2016-08-18;2016;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9901258945465088;it was pointed out that surveybased measures had shown greater resilience with the latest spf pointing to longterm expectations five years ahead of 18 having remained stable since the beginning of 2016 in this respect it could be argued that there was so far little sign that the anchoring of inflation expectations had diminished
2016-08-18;2016;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9659873247146606;by contrast marketbased measures of longterm inflation expectations such as the fiveyear forward inflationlinked swap rate five years ahead had been steadily declining for some time and remained close to record lows
2016-08-18;2016;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.8488337397575378;while acknowledging that their low level was a source of concern members also pointed to a number of technical factors that might currently distort marketbased indicators which called for prudence in their interpretation
2016-08-18;2016;August;REPORT;Positive;0.697331964969635;turning to fiscal policies members noted that the fiscal policy stance was expected to be neutral in 2017 after being slightly expansionary in 2016 and also highlighted the need for full and consistent implementation of the rules of the stability and growth pact both over time and across countries in order to maintain confidence in the fiscal framework
2016-08-18;2016;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9923553466796875;at the same time fiscal policies should also support the economic recovery and it was recalled that all countries should strive for a more growthfriendly composition of fiscal policies and that fiscal space should be used where appropriate
2016-08-18;2016;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9847127199172974;with regard to the monetary analysis members concurred with the assessment presented by mr praet in his introduction
2016-08-18;2016;August;REPORT;Positive;0.9893540143966675;broad money m3 had continued to grow at a robust pace in may 2016 as in previous months annual growth in m3 was mainly supported by its most liquid components with the narrow monetary aggregate m1 expanding at a solid rate

2016-08-18;2016;August;REPORT;Positive;0.9920933842658997;this was also seen to be confirmed by the latest evidence from the bank lending survey which had indicated a further improvement in conditions for loans to enterprises and households and a continued increase in demand across all loan categories
2016-08-18;2016;August;REPORT;Positive;0.9594752788543701;in the light of the prevailing uncertainties including with respect to the postuk referendum environment for banks and to the upcoming publication of the results of the european banking authority eba stress test it was seen as essential to safeguard the smooth transmission of monetary policy through the banking system which played a crucial role for the real economy in the euro area and was key to supporting the ongoing economic recovery
2016-08-18;2016;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9824184775352478;in this context it was noted that the equity prices of euro area banks had fallen following the uk referendum
2016-08-18;2016;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9933839440345764;while this could in part be associated with the likely direct impact of the outcome of the referendum it also reflected the continued underlying weakness in bank profitability related inter alia to a more prolonged period of only moderate growth and low interest rates as well as legacy issues stemming mainly from still high levels of nonperforming exposures in some parts of the euro area banking system which continued to weigh on banks balance sheets
2016-08-18;2016;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9926379919052124;it was argued that such vulnerabilities appeared to resurface with new shocks that posed a risk to the recovery of the euro area economy

2016-08-18;2016;August;REPORT;Negative;0.7334295511245728;it was argued that the cost of equity was a critical component of the cost of lending for banks whereby a high cost of capital could lower the net return on bank lending and thereby lead to more conservative lending behaviour by banks
2016-08-18;2016;August;REPORT;Positive;0.9828229546546936;at the same time the euro area banking system was seen to be in much better shape than at the time of the comprehensive assessment of bank balance sheets undertaken in 2014 on the basis of a more robust regulatory and supervisory environment capital positions had been strengthened provisioning against nonperforming exposures had increased and banks liquidity buffers were ample
