2016-05-05;2016;May;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.9937536120414734;for instance the debt sustainability analysis framework of the international monetary fund adopts a debt ratio of 85 of gdp to flag fiscal risks in advanced economies with a similar approach being followed in the european commissions methodology
