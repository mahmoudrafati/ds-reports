2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.991992175579071;it would be neutral in the sense that it would reflect proportionally all outstanding issues qualifying for the benchmark
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9923316240310669;this also implied that market capitalisation would provide a weighting for each of the jurisdictions of issuance within the benchmark

2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Positive;0.5941559672355652;euro area real gdp had expanded by 03 in the fourth quarter of 2015 supported by domestic demand while being dampened by a slightly negative contribution from net exports
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9725679755210876;recent incoming data for the first quarter of 2016 remained generally consistent with a continuation of the moderate economic recovery although reference was made to evidence at the country level that pointed to somewhat stronger real gdp growth dynamics in the first quarter of 2016 compared with the march 2016 ecb staff macroeconomic projections
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Negative;0.7735245823860168;overall the euro area had continued its moderate recovery
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Negative;0.990242063999176;while risks to the growth outlook had moderated to some extent they were assessed to still remain tilted to the downside
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9924660921096802;recent monetary policy decisions by the governing council had improved broad financing conditions which should support the outlook for consumption and investment
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9622387886047363;however uncertainties persisted relating in particular to developments in the global economy and to geopolitical risks
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.982252836227417;regarding the outlook and risks for the external environment members exchanged views taking into account the latest imf world economic outlook which had been released after the march 2016 ecb staff projections
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9513601064682007;they took note that in the latest imf forecasts growth prospects for the global economy in both 2016 and 2017 had been revised downwards compared with the update of the world economic outlook in january 2016 and that global trade growth at 28 was estimated to have been below global economic growth at 31 in 2015 the downward revision to global activity in the imfs forecasts was seen as a confirmation of the cautious view taken by the governing council in its previous monetary policy meeting
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Positive;0.6909152865409851;the latest imf forecasts could also be seen as providing further support for the view that one of the main challenges facing advanced economies was to increase productivity
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Positive;0.5853427052497864;at the same time the imfs latest world economic outlook could be considered rather pessimistic since members saw some more positive features in the global environment in particular the waning of the recent bout of turbulence in financial markets
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.6780001521110535;moreover it had to be borne in mind that the economic situation varied significantly across advanced economies with some recording close to full employment
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9831158518791199;commenting further on the global risks discussed during the imf annual meetings in washington reference was made to a possibly stronger slowdown in emerging market economies including china the potential return of financial market turmoil the risk that persistently slow growth would lead to weaker potential growth via hysteresis effects and geopolitical risks at both the regional and the global level
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Negative;0.6091493368148804;turning to the euro area members concurred with the view that the economic recovery was ongoing
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9914090037345886;growth dynamics were seen to be supported by the monetary policy measures and their favourable impact on financing conditions improvements in employment growth and the still relatively low price of oil which supported consumption
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9857718348503113;moreover it was observed that if growth for the first quarter of this year were to materialise in line with expectations this would constitute the twelfth consecutive quarter of positive economic growth for the euro area and the seventh quarter in a row of growth above potential
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.679237961769104;as a consequence the output gap was closing albeit only very gradually
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9851428866386414;such a slow speed of adjustment was not unusual in the context of a balance sheet recession which implied some leakage in the virtuous circle that normally took place between income and consumption growth
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9921118021011353;at the same time it was pointed out that the updated imf forecasts for growth in the euro area had been revised downwards notwithstanding the inclusion of the latest monetary policy package announced in march 2016 in addition some concern was expressed that the eurocoin indicator which was often cited as a useful cyclical indicator of growth in the euro area had in march seen its sharpest fall in over three years
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9834890365600586;with regard to price developments there was broad agreement with the assessment of the outlook and risks presented by mr praet in his introduction
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.993826687335968;annual euro area headline inflation was reported by eurostat to be 00 in march 2016 compared with 02 in the previous month
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9945640563964844;thus hicp inflation developments continued to be subdued
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Positive;0.6105310916900635;the improvement in headline inflation in march was mainly due to higher services price inflation
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9802723526954651;however it had to be borne in mind that the rebound in services price inflation from 09 in february to 14 in march had been largely due to travelrelated items such as package holidays and accommodation services as well as transportrelated items such as air transport which were influenced by the timing of the easter holidays
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9912761449813843;the annual rate of hicp inflation excluding food and energy had also increased to 10 from 08 in february
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.8813342452049255;looking ahead on the basis of current oil futures prices headline inflation was expected to return to negative territory in the next few months before rising in the latter part of the year as a result of the upward impact of base effects together with assumed increases in oil prices as embedded in the futures curve
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9316412806510925;in 201718 inflation was expected to pick up further in line with the projected economic recovery and supported by the ecbs monetary policy measures
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9810265302658081;members also discussed recent developments in inflation expectations
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9940577745437622;it was noted that the fiveyear forward inflationlinked swap rate five years ahead currently stood at around 14 and that the latest round of the ecb survey of professional forecasters indicated that average longerterm inflation expectations remained at 18 unchanged from the previous round
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9915692210197449;it was considered worrisome that despite the stabilisation in oil prices marketbased inflation expectations had not picked up from their low levels
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.6838924884796143;it appeared that there had been some decoupling of inflation expectations from oil price developments following the earlier correlation during the period when oil prices had fallen
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9956940412521362;while in principle a decoupling of inflation expectations from oil price developments was welcome in the current context this was a matter of concern as longerterm inflation expectations were not recovering in parallel with higher oil prices
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9944175481796265;at the same time it was noted that expectations of future oil price increases and their contribution to hicp inflation could have fallen below past averages which might in part explain the continued low level of marketbased inflation expectations
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Negative;0.920578122138977;in that regard structural changes in the supply of oil such as increased shale oil and gas production and irans return to the market could imply that low oil prices would in the future be a more persistent feature of inflation dynamics
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Negative;0.506780207157135;on the other hand geopolitical risks might have an impact on raw material and commodity prices alongside other factors determining headline inflation in the next year or so
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.6903946399688721;members then reviewed recent developments in wage growth which had stabilised at low levels with growth in compensation per employee below 15 in the fourth quarter of 2015 on the one hand this was seen as a possible indication of the prevailing risk of secondround effects whereby low headline inflation might already have started to feed into core inflation via lower wage growth
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9599884748458862;on the other hand however it was noted that conclusive evidence was lacking and more analysis would be needed to assess whether secondround effects were present
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.7061364650726318;overall there was broad agreement that while euro area inflation was expected to pick up it was crucial to ensure that the very low inflation environment did not become entrenched via secondround effects on wage and price setting
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9867393970489502;therefore the governing council would continue to monitor closely the evolution of the outlook for price stability
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9937102794647217;following the discussion of the economic outlook for growth and prices a broader discussion took place on issues related to the interaction of various policy domains in the euro area also in view of the low estimates for potential output in the euro area weak productivity growth still high unemployment and subdued business investment
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9882851839065552;reference was made to various policy initiatives to increase public and private investment and to the role of the central bank in addressing and communicating on structural reforms in particular
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Positive;0.7868434190750122;members strongly reiterated the need for other policy areas to contribute much more decisively both at the national and the european levels in order to reap the full benefits from the ecbs monetary policy measures
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9297856688499451;this echoed recent discussions at the european and global levels referring inter alia to the threepronged approach proposed by the imf in its world economic outlook
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9864122867584229;in particular members judged that action to raise productivity and improve the business environment including the provision of an adequate public infrastructure was vital to increase investment and boost job creation
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Positive;0.7958104610443115;the swift and effective implementation of structural reforms in an environment of accommodative monetary policy not only would lead to higher sustainable economic growth in the euro area but also would make the euro area more resilient to global shocks
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9792710542678833;as regards the role of monetary policy it was important to recall that longerterm potential growth and structural unemployment were mainly determined by real factors such as productivity and growth in the labour force
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9799971580505371;however it was observed that monetary policy could help by supporting a swift cyclical recovery towards production potential thereby avoiding a deterioration in the quality of labour that was generally associated with longer spells of unemployment
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9907317757606506;likewise higher investment supported by monetary policy during the phase of cyclical recovery could bolster the economywide capital stock thereby increasing productive capacity
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9225491881370544;while there was no doubt that the structural policies set by governments ultimately had a key role to play in determining growth in the long run and that the ecb was making a major contribution in the shorter run through its very accommodative monetary policy stance the question was how to communicate most effectively about structural reforms from a monetary policy perspective
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9825839400291443;generally it was agreed that giving structural reform recommendations might prove challenging as structural reform needs differed widely across euro area countries and it was not necessarily possible to generalise at the euro area aggregate level
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9852495789527893;moreover it was recalled that there were already countryspecific recommendations in the context of the european semester
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.989051103591919;thus a procedure already existed whereby the european commission was responsible for supporting the coordination of economic policies in the euro area and more broadly in the european union
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.933974027633667;it was to be regretted that these very detailed countryspecific recommendations were not being sufficiently followed up and implemented
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Positive;0.8021723031997681;that said it also had to be acknowledged that there had been some progress in implementing structural reforms in the euro area
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9063208699226379;many countries had implemented labour market reforms although product market reforms did not seem to have kept pace
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.796115517616272;more product market reforms could be considered the highest priority at the current juncture
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.984938383102417;overall while it was considered useful for the ecb to discuss matters further and to focus on the adverse consequences for the euro area of a lack of reforms establishing a detailed countryspecific agenda was in the realm of national governments and other european institutions
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9908922910690308;when discussing structural reforms the governing council would take a clear monetary policy perspective assessing the impact of pending structural reforms and the environment in which the ecb conducted monetary policy
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9862820506095886;first and foremost this entailed an assessment of the extent to which structural reforms affected developments in inflation most notably with respect to their short and longrun effects including possibly persistent disinflationary effects arising from too slow an implementation of structural reforms
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9749831557273865;moreover an assessment was needed of how and to what extent structural reforms would support convergence among euro area countries and improve risksharing for markets
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.8094567060470581;in that context it was recognised that major deficiencies remained at the european level
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.7462578415870667;in focusing on eu priorities the completion of the banking union was mentioned as was the importance of fostering the capital markets union
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9850191473960876;in addition completing the single market for services and establishing a common market for digital goods and services were also highlighted as areas which would have a positive impact on growth
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Positive;0.8296883702278137;it was suggested that the five presidents report completing europes economic and monetary union should be supported with greater resolve
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9879817366600037;in that respect quantitative analysis that underlined the cost of an incomplete economic and monetary union in terms of welfare and employment would be useful
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Negative;0.7946292757987976;it was also pointed out that the ecb had its own responsibilities as regards the euro area banking sector following the establishment of the single supervisory mechanism in 2014 finally turning to fiscal policies members highlighted the need to remain in compliance with the rules of the stability and growth pact in order to maintain confidence in the fiscal framework while at the same time supporting the economic recovery
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9726477265357971;it was recalled that countries should strive for a more growthfriendly composition of fiscal policies including the reduction of the tax burden on households and firms and should lower current government expenditure and increase the share of public investment within overall government expenditure
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9880157113075256;moreover fiscal space should be used where appropriate
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9762442111968994;it was suggested that more use should be made of incentives to stimulate investment and of programmes at the eu level
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9189130067825317;while it would be desirable to see results from the european commissions investment plan come to fruition quickly the comment was also made that the plan might not go far enough

2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9712382555007935;in assessing credit developments attention was drawn to the sizeable net lending position of nonfinancial corporations which taken together with subdued investment activity and strong retained earnings suggested that credit demand by firms could remain weak
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9883223176002502;a call was made to continue analytical work on the state of the banking sector including on remaining needs for balance sheet repair and for changes in business models given that banks were a key vehicle for the effective transmission of monetary policy in the euro area
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Negative;0.8067513704299927;it was also underlined that the degree of leverage in the banking sector reflected high debt levels in the private and public nonfinancial sectors in some countries

2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.7333197593688965;while inflation expectations had stabilised somewhat and financial market turbulence had receded marketbased measures of longterm inflation expectations remained at levels not far from the historical lows observed at the beginning of 2015 in such an environment it was felt important for monetary policy to counter strongly any emergence of secondround effects in price and wage setting
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Positive;0.7524872422218323;there was broad agreement that the ecbs monetary policy measures were being effective and that there were grounds for cautious optimism about the economy as outlined by mr praet in his introduction but that patience was needed for the measures to fully unfold over time in terms of output and inflation
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9887490272521973;it was highlighted that the monetary stimulus introduced since mid2014 had led to a significant and broadbased easing in borrowing conditions for the economy as a whole
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Positive;0.6455129384994507;further improvements in financing conditions had been seen following the adoption of the comprehensive measures at the earlymarch monetary policy meeting
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9817978143692017;in addition the passthrough of the monetary policy stimulus appeared to be strengthening notably through the banking system
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9309406280517578;the focus should now be on the implementation of the latest set of decisions including the new series of tltros and the cspp which were geared towards enhancing monetary transmission by supporting credit creation and further strengthening the passthrough of the eurosystems asset purchases to financing conditions in the real economy
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9824008345603943;it needed to be recalled that it was not just the announcement effects that had an impact but also the implementation phase which had not yet begun in the case of these latest measures
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9548606276512146;hence further monetary policy stimulus was still in the pipeline notably from the cspp and tltro ii which were set to start in june 2016 there was general agreement that there was a need to counter the perception that monetary policy could no longer contribute to a return of inflation to the governing councils aim of below but close to 2
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.8362576961517334;in this context counterfactual scenarios deserved emphasis ie
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9668398499488831;pointing out how the euro area economy would have fared had the ecb not acted
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.8379163146018982;monetary policy was geared towards achieving price stability over the medium term and remained effective via a number of channels including asset purchases and negative interest rates
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9813116192817688;with respect to the time horizon needed for hicp inflation rates to return to levels below but close to 2 it was recalled that the ecbs monetary policy strategy for good reasons had not specified a precise definition of the medium term as the policy horizon depended on the nature of the shocks affecting the economy and the length of the de facto variable transmission lags of monetary policy
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9912785887718201;in particular the mediumterm horizon should not be equated to the horizon of the staff projections as outside observers sometimes appeared to do when characterising the governing councils reaction function
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9693549871444702;in this regard great care was needed when framing the governing councils reaction function also in the context of forward guidance to avoid conveying the sense that monetary policy was mechanically focused on a specific time horizon
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.612223207950592;at the same time taking into account the nature of shocks and transmission lags in the governing councils mediumterm orientation was not to be misunderstood as a way of postponing the required return of inflation to levels in line with the objective
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Positive;0.8435599207878113;on the contrary it was felt that strongly reiterating the governing councils commitment to bring inflation back to target without undue delay and sticking to its forward guidance was essential to anchor expectations and support effective monetary transmission
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.7308954000473022;this was all the more important as inflation had been below the governing councils inflation aim for a period of three years which had raised issues regarding the notion of the medium term by outside observers
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Negative;0.4986730217933655;it was therefore underlined that it was essential not to leave any room for doubt about the governing councils commitment to secure a return of the inflation rate towards its mediumterm aim without undue delay
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9877390265464783;overall there was broad agreement to reaffirm following the proposal by mr praet in his introduction the governing councils forward guidance on both policy rates and the app
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9932326078414917;this implied conducting asset purchases under the app until the end of march 2017 or beyond if necessary and in any case until the governing council saw a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.7072623372077942;moreover the governing council continued to expect policy rates to remain at their present or lower levels for an extended period of time and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9200530648231506;finally it was underlined that the governing council was unanimous in its commitment to deliver on its mandate and on the appropriateness of an expansionary monetary policy stance
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.7803075313568115;in the light of recent public criticism that had appeared to link the ecbs decisions to developments in the political sphere in a member state it was viewed as important to reaffirm collectively the independence of the ecb in the pursuit of its mandate
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9798446893692017;regarding the operational parameters governing the cspp broad support was expressed for the executive board proposal presented by mr cœuré
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9325318336486816;it was recalled that the inclusion of corporate bonds in the app as decided by the governing council on 10 march 2016 was intended to provide more direct support for the financing of the real economy
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9568959474563599;this called for a flexible and pragmatic approach to ensure efficiency and effectiveness when addressing implementation issues
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9829815030097961;at the same time caution was advised with respect to a number of parameters in order to achieve an appropriate balance between the intended positive effects of the programme on activity and inflation and the reduction of relevant legal economic operational and reputational risks
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9864402413368225;on the main features governing the operational framework of the cspp it was underlined that the programme had a euro areawide focus and was subject to full income and loss sharing
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9800698757171631;turning to the parameters governing the geographical and sectoral scope of the cspp it was also argued that the effectiveness of the cspp should not be gauged by the size of purchases per se but depended on the targeted transmission channels aimed at supporting credit to the real economy
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9715015888214111;it was stressed that the inclusion of resident corporate issuers with noneuro area parent companies would often allow companies with significant real economy presence and investment in the euro area to benefit from the programme while the cspp would in any case be transmitted across corporate bond markets including nonresident issuers via portfolio balance effects
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9836611151695251;with respect to eligible residual maturities some remarks were made that the proposed upper limit of above 30 years seemed to be on the long side
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9438379406929016;however overall a preference for retaining long maturities was nonetheless expressed to avoid a weakening of the transmission impact given the longer average duration of the bonds that would be excluded
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9850345253944397;moreover the potential for increased issuance at longer durations should also be taken into account
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9922986626625061;with respect to other risk control parameters for the cspp after an exchange of views on the relative merits of different limits an overall preference for retaining the proposed issue share limit of 70 was expressed consistent with the other private sector purchase programmes under the app and the broad scope of the programme
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9926195740699768;monetary policy decisions and communication against this overall background and taking into account the views expressed by the members of the governing council the president concluded that the governing council had decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility would remain unchanged at 000 025 and 040 respectively
2016-05-19;2016;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9855650067329407;regarding nonstandard monetary policy measures the focus was now on the implementation of the additional measures that had been decided on 10 march 2016 the main technical parameters of the cspp were adopted by the governing council and scheduled for publication in a press release
