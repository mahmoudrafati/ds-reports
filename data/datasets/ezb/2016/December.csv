2016-12-22;2016;December;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.9110753536224364;the data quality problems can be grouped into two main categories the first category includes issues that are due to misreporting by the counterparties or the trs whereas the second category includes problems that are caused by a lack of standardisation and harmonisation
2016-12-22;2016;December;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.9590288400650024;one of the main issues detected in the first category is related to the marktomarket value of the reported contracts a significant number of outstanding trades do not have an assigned marktomarket value despite the fact that most counterparties are required to provide daily updates for this field

2016-12-22;2016;December;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.990104615688324;the empirical results in var models are typically derived from socalled impulse response functions which display the impact of a typical change in one variable on all variables captured within the system
2016-12-22;2016;December;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.9891042709350586;these shocks typically amount to one standard deviation of the historical volatility of the variable and are typically temporary with the unwinding of the shock itself endogenously being determined within the model
2016-12-22;2016;December;Monetary Policy Decisions;Positive;0.9159958958625792;structural var models have proved especially useful in this context as they allow for an improved identification and estimation of the true uncertainty shocks
2016-12-22;2016;December;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.5968473553657532;85 such analysis has been carried out to quantify the impact of uncertainty shocks on economic activity for the united states and a few individual countries86 by using different proxies to measure the level of uncertainty implied equity market volatility economic policy uncertainty financial uncertainty or macroeconomic uncertainty

2016-12-22;2016;December;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.9820898771286012;most empirical studies focus on the united states and on industrial production as an economic activity indicator
2016-12-22;2016;December;Monetary Policy Decisions;Negative;0.9784947633743286;for example a temporary one standard deviation increase in implied stockmarket volatility as a proxy for uncertainty is found to be associated with a rapid drop in industrial production followed by a sharp rebound suggesting that uncertainty shocks amplify the magnitude of business cycles
2016-12-22;2016;December;Monetary Policy Decisions;Negative;0.9798874855041504;in comparison a temporary firstmoment shock to the federal funds rate displays a much more persistent drop and subsequent recovery

2016-12-22;2016;December;Monetary Policy Decisions;Negative;0.8847730159759521;one problem with structural var models is that only a limited number of endogenous variables can be included this raises the possibility that the estimated impact of an uncertainty shock might at least partly reflect the impact of shocks to other variables not included in the model

2016-12-22;2016;December;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.981895923614502;a standard approach has been to rely on timing estimating the movements in output investment and employment that follow jumps in uncertainty
2016-12-22;2016;December;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.9663581252098083;82 this approach is problematic if changes in uncertainty are correlated with other factors driving the economic cycle but which are not included in the empirical model
2016-12-22;2016;December;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.987875521183014;in this case the economic impact attributed to changes in uncertainty could at least partly reflect the impact of omitted variables
2016-12-22;2016;December;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.98555725812912;a second approach has been to use structural general equilibrium models to quantify the impact of uncertainty shocks
2016-12-22;2016;December;Monetary Policy Decisions;Negative;0.5307453870773315;83 a key problem in this approach is the need to rely on a  sometimes large  set of assumptions and to take into account the uncertainty around their validity
2016-12-22;2016;December;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.9887059926986694;a final approach relies on events such as natural disasters political coups terrorist attacks etc

2016-12-22;2016;December;Monetary Policy Decisions;Negative;0.7750576734542847;84 an issue with this approach is that such shocks might influence the behaviour of investors and consumers beyond changes in uncertainty
2016-12-22;2016;December;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.9857094287872314;timeseries models have been the standard approach to estimate the impact of uncertainty shocks on activity

2016-12-22;2016;December;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.990728497505188;the composite indicator of uncertainty in the euro area exhibits key characteristics similar to other recently published macroeconomic uncertainty indices
2016-12-22;2016;December;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.866639256477356;first the indicator displays a wide range of observations at its extremes the indicator rose by up to three standard deviations from its mean in early 2009 and fell by up to one standard deviation below that level
2016-12-22;2016;December;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.912499189376831;second the indicator shows a positive skewness which implies that the mass of the distribution of observed uncertainty levels is concentrated at belowaverage levels
2016-12-22;2016;December;Monetary Policy Decisions;Negative;0.5685207843780518;in other words the indicator suggests that there are more frequent and longerlasting periods of low uncertainty than of high uncertainty
2016-12-22;2016;December;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.6593030691146851;third the indicator also reveals a relatively high kurtosis
2016-12-22;2016;December;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.893328845500946;this implies that the distribution has tails that asymptotically approach zero more slowly than a gaussian distribution
2016-12-22;2016;December;Monetary Policy Decisions;Negative;0.4541066586971283;it also shows peaks at some other times notably the longterm capital management ltcm crisis in september 1998 the terrorist attacks in new york in september 2001 and the first greek crisis in spring 2010 uncertainty in the euro area according to this indicator decreased substantially as the current recovery started and recorded below average levels in 2014 however it returned to its historical average level from early 2015 in the context of the debate on the debt crisis in greece and more recently the referendum in the united kingdom on eu membership
2016-12-22;2016;December;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.9628028869628906;in other words the distribution of observed uncertainty levels includes more outliers in this case on the righthand side of the mean than the normal distribution

2016-12-22;2016;December;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.9647254347801208;79 for the euro area as a whole there is very limited evidence about the impact of uncertainty on activity as the empirical literature typically focuses on the united states or on individual euro area countries
2016-12-22;2016;December;Monetary Policy Decisions;Negative;0.9929880499839784;one reason is that negative news shocks such as terrorist attacks wars and oil price shocks that can cause recessions also cause higher uncertainty at the same time
2016-12-22;2016;December;Monetary Policy Decisions;Negative;0.9904085397720336;62 another reason for heightened uncertainty during recessions is that recessions might themselves increase uncertainty
2016-12-22;2016;December;Monetary Policy Decisions;Negative;0.5367123484611511;active trading helps to generate and spread information as trading activity slows down during recessions the flow of new information also slows down thereby potentially increasing uncertainty
2016-12-22;2016;December;Monetary Policy Decisions;Negative;0.9826852083206176;63 another explanation is that policy becomes more uncertain during recessions because policymakers implement new measures to revive growth
2016-12-22;2016;December;Monetary Policy Decisions;Negative;0.9757594466209412;64 finally forecasters might find it more difficult to make forecasts during recessions as the latter are more unusual events and deviate from the usual pattern of positive growth
2016-12-22;2016;December;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.9770123958587646;65 the composite indicator of macroeconomic uncertainty in the euro area is based on proxies for uncertainty which are negatively correlated to activity and which have proved to be granger causal for activity growth
