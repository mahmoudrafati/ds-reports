2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9634917378425598;real gdp had continued to expand in the fourth quarter of 2015 and recent data releases remained consistent with an ongoing moderate economic recovery
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9938262104988098;however the recovery appeared to have lost some momentum
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9892493486404419;domestic demand in the euro area was expected to remain relatively resilient supported by lower oil prices and a more expansionary fiscal stance as well as by the ecbs monetary policy measures while a weaker international environment with notably slower growth in emerging market economies was weighing on global activity and trade leading to more subdued foreign demand for euro area exports
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9846359491348267;this assessment was reflected in the outlook for growth in the march 2016 ecb staff macroeconomic projections
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Negative;0.937741219997406;as expected compared with the december 2015 eurosystem staff projections the growth outlook had been revised downwards
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9937937259674072;members took note that the effects of the nonstandard measures decided at the december 2015 monetary policy meeting had been incorporated into the march 2016 projections exercise
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8111997246742249;it was also recognised that the technical assumptions used in the march 2016 staff projections for growth and inflation had to some extent been positively influenced by expectations of additional monetary policy measures by the ecb without which the downward revisions would have been larger
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9888808727264404;regarding the outlook and risks for the external environment the latest staff projections contained further downward revisions in the short term to global activity and trade
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9710558652877808;it was remarked that the downward revisions could to some extent be considered as the materialisation of risks which had already been identified by the governing council in september 2015 in this context it was highlighted that the baseline projection for the euro area was predicated on the assumption of a rather swift rebound in world trade
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Positive;0.8066230416297913;while the baseline was generally supported caution was also expressed about the projected strengthening in global activity
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9933049082756042;overall despite some better economic news emanating recently from the united states there was broad agreement that the outlook for the external environment continued to be uncertain and subject to downside risks largely related to vulnerabilities in emerging market economies
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9828107357025146;turning to the euro area there was broad agreement with the revised growth outlook in the ecb staff projections
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9918484687805176;the updated projections were generally viewed as confirmation that the ongoing recovery in the euro area economy remained weak and fragile
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9912824630737305;against this background it was observed that the euro area economy continued to be rather vulnerable to adverse shocks
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9829607605934143;at the same time the importance of distinguishing between the baseline scenario and the risks surrounding this baseline was emphasised
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9763412475585938;although the downward revisions to the outlook for growth were disappointing the baseline scenario still incorporated a gradual acceleration in economic activity
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Negative;0.7346867918968201;moreover the downward revisions were mostly related to external rather than domestic adverse developments
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9898675680160522;private consumption was expected to remain robust based on continued real income growth supported by low energy prices and a further gradual improvement in euro area labour markets and business investment was expected to pick up in line with increasing demand
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9915127158164978;a number of positive indicators were also mentioned which could provide a basis for more optimism about the current economic situation including the january industrial production data for the two largest euro area countries and the continued improvement in labour markets which reflected some positive effects of past structural reforms
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Negative;0.517272412776947;the view was put forward that taking these factors into account the outlook for the euro area should not be regarded as overly pessimistic and conveying an unduly gloomy assessment should be avoided
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.7798383235931396;commenting on the outlook for domestic demand in more detail the balance of risks was mostly seen to be on the downside
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9864800572395325;while noting that wage dynamics were expected to be weaker than previously foreseen members expressed the view that the outlook for income growth as foreseen in the staff projections might still be subject to downside risks given the past projection errors in wages the degree of slack remaining in the labour market and the possible effects of past structural reforms
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.7960516214370728;it was noted that labour market conditions in the euro area although improving were still far from those in other major economies such as the united states and the united kingdom
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9843224883079529;reference was also made to the continued existence of savings and investment imbalances across both sectors and countries
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9937435984611511;the view was put forward that these might be exacerbated by elevated uncertainty and the low level of interest rates which might in some cases adversely affect confidence as well as the expected return on savings possibly leading to higher savings and lower growth in household consumption notably in countries where private pension plans and life insurance played a large role
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9924024343490601;in addition members expressed concern about the outlook for private investment
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9943886399269104;it appeared that despite low borrowing costs and the availability of ample internal financing firms continued to be cautious about undertaking investments perhaps owing to the perceived high level of uncertainty and the low potential growth rate
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Negative;0.6761325597763062;in this context the argument was made that for countries with available fiscal space public investment could be increased while at the european level there was a need to see more results from the european commissions investment plan for europe
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Negative;0.7089105248451233;overall the recovery in the euro area economy was expected to continue at a more subdued pace while the risks to the growth outlook were mostly seen to remain tilted to the downside
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9338655471801758;these risks related in particular to the heightened uncertainties regarding the external environment and to broader geopolitical risks
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Negative;0.5207595825195312;against this background members reiterated the necessity for other policy areas to support sustained output growth and that monetary policy on its own was not sufficient
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.5219250917434692;there was a need for both structural reforms and fiscal policy to also play their part
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9880808591842651;in particular given the high level of structural unemployment in the euro area and the low growth in potential output the ongoing cyclical recovery should be supported by effective structural policies regarding both labour and product markets
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9875096678733826;in addition to leading to higher sustainable economic growth structural reforms would help to improve the resilience of the euro area to global shocks
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9355406761169434;as regards fiscal policy members highlighted the need to comply with the rules of the stability and growth pact while at the same time stressing that existing elements of flexibility should be used
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.5235456228256226;a more growthfriendly composition of fiscal policies could support the economic recovery as could the use of fiscal space where appropriate
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9860904216766357;with regard to price developments in the euro area there was broad agreement with the assessment of the outlook and risks presented by mr praet in his introduction
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Negative;0.6527586579322815;the return to negative headline inflation in february was due to lower annual rates in all the main components including services and nonenergy industrial goods
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Negative;0.993500292301178;according to eurostats flash release the annual rate of hicp inflation excluding food and energy had also fallen back unexpectedly
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.503645122051239;in the short term on the basis of current oil futures prices headline inflation was expected to remain in negative territory for a number of months before rising later in the year linked to strong upward base effects and the assumed oil price increases embedded in the futures curve
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9899681806564331;over the medium term inflation was expected to pick up in line with the economic recovery in the baseline projection
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.6274957656860352;a combination of factors including lower energy prices and the appreciation of the effective exchange rate of the euro were seen to be responsible for a substantial downward revision to the outlook for hicp inflation compared with late 2015 this assessment was reflected in the march 2016 ecb staff projections where the hicp inflation outlook had been revised down significantly for 2016 and 2017 in comparison with the december 2015 eurosystem staff projections
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.7515516877174377;it was also noted that the downward revisions to inflation would have been larger were it not for the fact that the march projections already incorporated via the technical assumptions some expectations by financial markets of further monetary policy measures
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9949666857719421;members expressed concern about the prospect that it would now take longer to reach the inflation objective than previously expected
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Negative;0.8700153827667236;according to the latest ecb staff projections which now incorporated projections for 2018 for the first time headline inflation was expected to be only 16 in 2018 underpinning the assessment that the return of headline inflation to rates below but close to 2 would be further postponed
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8579290509223938;the sequence of downward revisions over time to both the growth and inflation projections was recalled
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9821144938468933;against this background it was felt that it had to be acknowledged that inflation would not return to the ecbs inflation aim for some time to come while keeping in mind that the ecbs definition of price stability over the medium term was not tied to the horizon of the staff projections
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.978935718536377;in this context attention was drawn to the fact that inflation had already been well below 2 for most of the period since 2012 the adverse implications of persistently low inflation for the process of debt deleveraging and also for financial stability were pointed out by comparing this profile for inflation with a counterfactual one in which inflation was close to 2 over the same period
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Negative;0.8979774117469788;looking more closely at the evolution of the main components of inflation it was noted that the dominant forces driving the headline inflation rate continued to be global factors namely lower energy prices and the exchange rate
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9027426838874817;the volatility of oil prices and of exchange rates had increased recently
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9841703176498413;it was remarked that the importance of these factors in determining headline inflation could be illustrated by updating the projections with the higher oil price and weaker exchange rate developments after the cutoff date of 15 february 2016 which would result in somewhat higher inflation than in the baseline scenario
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9844777584075928;however it was also mentioned that oil prices over the more recent past had been determined not only by supply factors but also by weaker demand which if persistent would not be a positive signal for the outlook
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9830127358436584;members exchanged views about the implications of the latest developments in measures of underlying inflation
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9859296679496765;in particular concern was expressed about the lower rate of hicp inflation excluding food and energy in the february flash release
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9929839372634888;it was noted that if the reasons for the decline were permanent this would dampen the outlook for underlying inflation still further
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9902412295341492;however the reasons behind the decline in hicp inflation excluding food and energy in the latest release had not yet been fully explored and it was possible that a significant part of this decline was due to temporary factors
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.905468225479126;at the same time it was mentioned that although underlying inflation remained positive the decline recorded in february was a new element which raised questions about the outlook for inflation compared with the situation last year when core inflation had been rising slowly but steadily by around 01 percentage point each quarter
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9924650192260742;on the one hand the weakness in hicp inflation excluding food and energy could be read as a signal of the insufficient level of aggregate demand in the economy which it was argued remained the main problem for the euro area
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8098732233047485;on the other hand it was reasoned that there had also been deeper changes in the saving and spending behaviour of economic agents after the financial crisis reflecting among other things rebalancing needs including wage and price adjustments and balance sheet repair in a number of sectors and countries
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9921787977218628;as a consequence of such possibly structural changes past experience did not provide much guidance as regards the reaction of inflation to the closing of the output gap which gave rise to increased uncertainty about the inflation outlook
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9606553912162781;recent developments in euro area inflation expectations were also scrutinised by members
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9939722418785095;the further decline in marketbased measures since the governing councils previous monetary policy meeting and the risk of an unanchoring of inflation expectations continued to be a key concern
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9304755926132202;the importance of halting the decline in inflation expectations was emphasised
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9933764338493347;wage increases had already turned out much lower than previously expected albeit for a range of different reasons including windfall gains in households real disposable income and concern was voiced that secondround effects might be larger than those incorporated into the staff projections
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Negative;0.7955050468444824;it was important to avoid a pattern of low wages and low prices becoming entrenched in the expectations and behaviour of economic agents
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Negative;0.8713346719741821;at the same time some caution was again expressed regarding the reliability of the information content of marketbased measures of inflation expectations for a number of reasons including liquidity effects associated with the ecbs app
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8016490340232849;it was also noted that surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations such as the ecbs survey of professional forecasters remained more benign
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9928096532821655;according to this view while there was a danger that persistently low inflation outcomes might spill over into inflation expectations the risk of an unanchoring of inflation expectations and of deflation could still be considered to be low
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.6124329566955566;overall there was broad agreement that while euro area inflation was expected to pick up there had been a further downward revision of the inflation outlook mainly reflecting lower oil prices in recent months so that the return to inflation rates below but close to 2 would take longer than previously expected
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9791790246963501;the risks surrounding the outlook for hicp inflation were also assessed to remain on the downside
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Positive;0.5371405482292175;with regard to the monetary analysis members concurred with the assessment presented by mr praet in his introduction that the recovery in money and credit dynamics had continued
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9858903884887695;m3 growth had remained robust in january 2016 mainly supported by the most liquid components and reflecting the impact of the monetary policy measures and the low opportunity cost of holding monetary instruments
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9383602142333984;loan dynamics had continued on the gradual recovery path observed since the beginning of 2014 bank credit to both firms and households had continued to expand with the annual rate of change of loans to nfcs adjusted for loan sales and securitisation rebounding in january
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Positive;0.5029367804527283;developments in mfi loans to enterprises continued to mirror the lagged relationship with the business cycle and credit risk as well as ongoing balance sheet adjustments which reflected still high levels of nonperforming loans
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9910536408424377;loan dynamics were also supported by the accommodative monetary policy stance and the passthrough of monetary policy measures in place since june 2014 which had improved borrowing conditions and credit flows across the euro area
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9927945733070374;notably fragmentation across euro area countries had declined with a significant compression of loan spreads
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9115893244743347;the ecbs monetary policy measures were thus seen to have contributed strongly to the turn in the credit cycle in the euro area since 2014 from a global perspective economies could be considered to be at different stages of the financial cycle with the united states being more advanced than the euro area and perhaps having even completed the associated process of balance sheet correction while in the euro area this was still under way
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9821211695671082;it was also noted that there could potentially be more positive news for the credit outlook from the regulatory side with indications of a forthcoming clarification by the european commission on the nature of pillar 2 requirements under the capital requirements directive which could be reflected in the implementation of these requirements by the single supervisory mechanism and could help reduce some of the regulatory uncertainty weighing on euro area banks
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Negative;0.5259386301040649;monetary policy stance and policy considerations with regard to the monetary policy stance members widely shared the assessment provided by mr praet in his introduction that since the previous monetary policy meeting of the governing council in january downside risks to the governing councils mediumterm price stability objective had increased overall as also indicated by the downward revisions for inflation and growth in the march 2016 staff macroeconomic projections
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Positive;0.4263784885406494;against this background members widely agreed that there was a need to reconsider the governing councils monetary policy stance with a view to providing further substantial monetary stimulus to counteract heightened risks to the ecbs price stability objective
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9910560846328735;accordingly an adequately calibrated package of measures was seen as needed to secure the return of inflation towards levels below but close to 2 without undue delay
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Negative;0.7990580201148987;members widely agreed that while the recovery of the euro area economy was expected to proceed euro area growth momentum would be slower and inflation lower for longer than previously anticipated
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.5389862656593323;this implied yet another postponement of the date by which inflation was expected to return to rates in line with the governing councils mediumterm aim
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9922875165939331;while much of the downgrade in the inflation outlook was due to falling oil prices and their prevailing future path measures of underlying inflation were also projected to be weaker than previously foreseen

2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.914829432964325;this package needed to be adequately calibrated to further ease financing conditions stimulate new credit provision and thereby reinforce the momentum of the euro areas economic recovery and accelerate the return of inflation to levels below but close to 2

2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9875953197479248;attractive funding conditions for banks in turn were seen to further ease private sector credit conditions and to stimulate overall credit dynamics
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9553464651107788;therefore the proposed inbuilt price incentive scheme of tltro ii aimed at providing incentives for the creation of new credit to the private sector was widely supported
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Negative;0.6152896285057068;it was argued that the pricing scheme of tltro ii would also contribute to a further defragmentation in the money markets
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9279325008392334;while in the current circumstances some banks could already borrow at the eonia rate the tltros would ease funding conditions for a broader range of banks provided they were able to increase lending to the real economy in excess of the respective benchmarks
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9917831420898438;however a few members expressed concerns about central bank operations continuing to replace the functioning of private markets and perpetuating banks dependence on eurosystem financing as well as about the size of the proposed price incentive scheme
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9848753809928894;the price reduction of up to the level of the deposit facility rate seemed to be rather generous could lead to market distortions and could contribute to the preservation of weak business models by some banks
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9924622774124146;regarding the applicable interest rate over the life of tltro ii members generally felt that it was appropriate to charge a fixed rate upon allotment of the operation
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Positive;0.7175343036651611;this would be simple and attractive as banks could lock in their tltro funds at very favourable funding conditions for four years
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9919286966323853;with respect to the definition of eligible loans on the basis of which the borrowing allowance would be calculated it was agreed that the practice applied in the first series of tltros should be maintained whereby eligible loans were defined as those of euro area nfcs and households excluding loans to households for house purchase
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9771572947502136;the assessment was widely shared that lending for house purchase was best excluded from the tltros to avoid fuelling housing price bubbles by channelling savings into the housing sector
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9824386239051819;on the calculation of the benchmark there was broad support for maintaining the mechanism adopted for the first series of tltros
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9922385811805725;accordingly the benchmark net lending would be set at zero for those banks with positive net lending while the benchmark would be set at a lower level for those banks that were undergoing deleveraging
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9820245504379272;for banks to fully reap the benefits of the attractive new conditions of tltro ii it was also agreed they should be given an extra repayment opportunity for the existing tltros to allow them to switch to the more attractive conditions of tltro ii
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9707876443862915;turning to the app proposals members widely agreed to the proposed expansion of the monthly purchases from 60 billion to 80 billion
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9811835289001465;a sizeable expansion in the monthly volume of purchases was seen as substantially strengthening the effectiveness of the asset purchases mainly by reinforcing the portfolio rebalancing channel
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9861490726470947;wealth effects and a further compression of longterm yields should foster the effective passthrough of the asset purchases whereby lending rates to the real economy should also benefit further
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9783037304878235;as regards the parameters of the app with a view to ensuring the smooth implementation of future asset purchases there was wide support for the proposal to increase the issuer limit and issue share limit for securities issued by eligible supranational institutions from their current level to 50
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9919528365135193;a few members restated their reservations concerning the app namely with respect to public sector bonds and voiced concerns as on previous occasions about a further expansion of asset purchases as purchases of sovereign securities were more than other monetary policy instruments associated with a number of specific challenges and side effects
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9825196266174316;the view was reiterated that recourse to broadbased asset purchases including public sector paper should therefore remain a contingency instrument to be used only as an ultima ratio in an adverse scenario such as a situation of imminent deflation for which there was no evidence at present
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Positive;0.8116117715835571;in this regard the costs and risks of engaging further in public sector asset purchases particularly in the medium to long term would outweigh their potential benefits also considering diminishing returns of scale and taking into account that even deeper cuts in the deposit facility rate or strongly targeted lending operations could have more traction on the economy
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9840326905250549;broad support was expressed for the proposal to include investmentgrade eurodenominated bonds issued by nonbank corporations as a new asset class in the eligible universe of purchasable assets under the app
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9677340388298035;the inclusion of corporate bonds was seen as strengthening the credibility of the overall expansion of the monthly purchase volume and more directly signalling the support provided by the app for the financing of the real economy
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9242330193519592;it was also noted that the purchases could have important spillover effects on the financing conditions of smes in the light of international evidence indicating that the banking sector redirected lending to smes when large companies bond issuance substituted for bank borrowing
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9215702414512634;nonetheless there were also cautionary remarks concerning the possible effectiveness of the purchases of corporate bonds
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Negative;0.8665401935577393;it was noted that in the euro area the market for these bonds was generally not very liquid or large and purchases in such a market could therefore raise level playing field issues and lead to market distortions
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.7648157477378845;moreover the direct impact on corporate financing conditions and investment behaviour appeared doubtful as the eurosystem would mainly purchase bonds from highly rated cashrich corporations whose financing costs were already very low and whose investment behaviour in any case was not constrained by the cost or availability of funding
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9902425408363342;regarding some operational features of the corporate asset purchases to be established under the new cspp there was broad support for the inclusion of eurodenominated investmentgrade bonds of corporations established in the euro area while the more detailed features of the programme still had to be worked out
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.6647636890411377;robust and clear eligibility criteria needed to be spelt out further also considering the treatment of smaller issuers and smes and fragmentation in the corporate bond market
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9838541150093079;turning to interest rates broad support was expressed for the proposal to lower all the key ecb policy interest rates further whereby the rate on the mros and the rate on the marginal lending facility would be cut by 5 basis points to 000 and 025 respectively and the rate on the deposit facility would be cut by 10 basis points to 040
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9769710898399353;nonetheless different views were expressed about the costs and benefits of moving further into negative territory and the respective implications for the formulation of the governing councils forward guidance on policy interest rates
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9932988882064819;on the one hand concerns were raised about possible undesirable side effects that could arise from moving further into negative territory particularly in combination with fastgrowing excess liquidity
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Negative;0.968226969242096;a further cut in the deposit facility rate could unduly increase the pressure on banks profitability which could have adverse effects on the stability of the banking sector
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9796701669692993;as rates on bank customers deposits were typically constrained at zero a further decline in rates charged on the asset side would lead to a compression in banks margins
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Negative;0.7755424380302429;moreover the transmission of monetary policy via bank intermediation could be affected negatively as banks could recoup part of the costs by increasing lending rates or increasing fees and other charges in their crossselling activities
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9880289435386658;cutting interest rates further in a market environment where uncertainty about the impact of negative rates prevailed could also further exacerbate financial market volatility and have direct negative repercussions on the confidence of euro area households and firms as well as weigh on the profitability of insurance companies and pension funds including corporate pension schemes
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8721086978912354;finally caution was also expressed with regard to the effectiveness of further reductions in the deposit facility rate both as regards domestic channels of transmission and the exchange rate channel
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.5201971530914307;on the other hand a number of arguments were put forward pointing to the benefits of a further cut in the deposit facility rate
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Positive;0.7841413021087646;lowering the rate further into negative territory was seen as an effective tool for providing additional monetary easing which also reinforced the impact of the other monetary policy measures in place by stimulating the velocity of reserves
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9824202060699463;moreover past cuts in the rate had not only led to lower shortterm interest rates but had compressed interest rates across the spectrum of the yield curve also at the longer end
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.6583707928657532;as regards the possible impact on banks profitability a general equilibrium perspective was warranted that went beyond the direct effects of negative interest rates on the profit and loss account of banks
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9909420609474182;taking a broader view on balance the combination of all monetary policy measures taken including negative rates appeared to have contributed positively to banks profitability thus far
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9900749325752258;this was evidenced by overall increasing net interest income and banks return on equity in the course of 2015 the first full year of negative rates as well as by rising lending volumes
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9854534864425659;banks appeared to benefit from the low interest rate environment as a decline in interest revenues was more than compensated for by lower costs of funding and an expansion in credit volumes together with possible holding gains on assets
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9684649705886841;with regard to the possible external dimension of a policy rate cut it had to be stressed that further monetary easing was aimed at improving domestic financing conditions
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.559745728969574;against this background overall members broadly supported a further cut in the deposit facility rate
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9458029270172119;with respect to the envisaged size of such a cut the importance of communication and the link to the formulation of forward guidance was underlined
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9937426447868347;on the one hand a sharper rate cut could be considered together with indications that the effective lower bound would have been reached for all practical purposes
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8203974366188049;on the other hand the proposed limited rate cut could be judged as appropriate for now given the current assessment while it would also not rule out the possibility and prospect of further cuts if warranted by the outlook for price stability
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9828106164932251;most members favoured the proposed cut of 10 basis points in conjunction with maintaining the formulation of at present or lower levels in the governing councils forward guidance
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Negative;0.8251240253448486;it was argued that from todays perspective and taking into account the support provided by the policy measures to growth and inflation policy rates would be expected to remain at very low levels and that further rate reductions would not be anticipated at this stage
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9879204034805298;nonetheless the governing council would not rule out future cuts in policy rates as new shocks could change the outlook for inflation which might warrant further monetary policy action with policy rates remaining part of the governing councils toolbox
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.991954505443573;members also exchanged views on the possibility of introducing an exemption scheme for the deposit facility rate applicable to banks holdings of excess reserves
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9634919762611389;such a scheme was in principle seen as an instrument for mitigating possible negative effects on bank profits and for ensuring the smooth transmission of monetary policy
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Negative;0.7020596861839294;however doubts were expressed in view of the overall complexity of such a system from an operational perspective and considering that there was little evidence of negative side effects at the current juncture
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8859655261039734;against this background the introduction of an exemption scheme was not seen as warranted at this stage
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9809261560440063;finally as regards forward guidance broad support was expressed for linking the forward guidance on the likely future path of policy interest rates to the forward guidance on the asset purchases in a hierarchical and sequential manner by adding and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases to the existing formulation on forward guidance
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9715993404388428;this would anchor expectations about the relative sequencing thereby providing greater clarity about the governing councils expectations with respect to the future path of policy interest rates
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9874380230903625;the envisaged formulation on policy rate forward guidance needed to be fully consistent with the ecbs monetary policy strategy to reflect the current forward guidance on asset purchases and to ensure interdependence of the app and the policy interest rates
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9833298325538635;however a remark was also made that keeping interest rates low well past the horizon of the app could be perceived by the public as allowing inflation to overshoot in the future
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Negative;0.7701511979103088;in the overall assessment of the proposed policy package some remarks were made on the effectiveness of the monetary policy measures taken previously and of the proposed policy package also in view of recent market concerns about the limits of monetary policy
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9788320064544678;members broadly agreed that the monetary policy measures taken since june 2014 had been critical in supporting the euro area recovery and in arresting even stronger disinflation
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8290146589279175;it was therefore seen as important to firmly reiterate that the monetary policy measures were working and had been delivering their intended effects for which there was ample evidence
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9826623201370239;the combination of measures such as the rate cuts the forward guidance the earlier credit easing measures and the app had led to a broadbased and significant easing in financing conditions for all sectors of the economy
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Negative;0.954470157623291;in particular the monetary policy measures taken since june 2014 were seen as having been instrumental in contributing to a reversal in credit dynamics
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Positive;0.8128818869590759;the measures had also helped to reduce fragmentation with the passthrough of the ecbs policy stance improving in countries most affected by the crisis and declines in lending rates for nfcs following the ecbs monetary policy measures taken since june 2014 being substantially greater in these countries
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9766407012939453;it needed to be emphasised that the monetary policy measures taken had proven to be effective and had delivered significant effects on growth in inflation
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9904550909996033;in a counterfactual scenario of the absence of monetary policy support inflation would likely be significantly in negative territory and economic growth would be visibly lower
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9887605309486389;the current low inflation environment should not be attributed to ineffective monetary policy measures rather it was largely the result of a succession of negative shocks stemming mainly from the external environment but also from weaker than expected domestic price pressures
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9259281158447266;at the same time it was highlighted that the possible risks and side effects of the monetary policy instruments in use particularly with regard to financial stability risks had to be better understood and required further careful analysis and assessment
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Positive;0.7411791682243347;members generally expressed confidence in the effectiveness of the envisaged policy package even though nuanced views were put forward on the relative merits of the various elements of the package
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9848751425743103;overall it was highlighted that the agreed policy package consisted of a comprehensive set of measures that largely complemented and reinforced each other
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9912142753601074;while the cut in policy rates would impact the whole spectrum of the yield curve the asset purchases further flattened the curve with the portfolio rebalancing effects being reinforced by the negative interest rates
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Positive;0.5846017599105835;at the same time the new series of tltros and the purchases of nonbank corporate bonds would further ease the funding conditions of banks and firms boosting the passthrough of the monetary policy stance to the borrowing conditions faced by the private sector
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9823535680770874;while monetary policy had to do whatever was needed to pursue its price stability objective a strong call was reiterated for other policy areas to step up decisively their efforts to strengthen sustainable growth prospects in the euro area also to avoid the risk of overburdening monetary policy
2016-04-07;2016;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9666805267333984;monetary policy decisions and communication against this overall background and taking into account the views expressed by the members of the governing council the president concluded that a large majority of voting members supported the proposed policy package comprising a cut in the interest rates on the eurosystems mros and on the marginal lending facility of 5 basis points to 000 and 025 respectively a cut in the interest rate on the deposit facility of 10 basis points to 040 an expansion of the monthly purchases under the app to 80 billion starting in april the inclusion of investmentgrade eurodenominated bonds issued by nonbank corporations established in the euro area in the list of assets eligible for regular purchases and the launch of a new series of four targeted longerterm refinancing operations each with a maturity of four years starting in june 2016
