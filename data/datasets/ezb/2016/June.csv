2016-06-16;2016;June;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.9411383271217346;70 there is therefore broad consensus that automatic fiscal stabilisers represent the first line of defence by being a predictable and systematic response to normal asymmetric shocks

2016-06-16;2016;June;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.9852160215377808;the direction of the euro area fiscal stance may therefore reflect very different developments at individual country level with for example fiscal tightening in some countries and fiscal loosening in others
