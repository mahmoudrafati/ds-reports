2016-11-17;2016;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9799302816390991;looking ahead headline inflation was expected to pick up further initially largely on account of base effects and later supported by the expected gradual economic recovery and the accommodative monetary policy stance
2016-11-17;2016;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9914871454238892;looking in more detail at the shortterm outlook for prices headline inflation was expected to pick up over the coming months to exceed 1 in early 2017 broadly converging with measures of underlying inflation
2016-11-17;2016;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.6317160725593567;while this was in part a sign of the effectiveness of the ecbs monetary policy measures the very nearterm developments in headline inflation were largely driven by base effects as the negative drag from past energy price declines would fade away over the coming months
2016-11-17;2016;November;REPORT;Negative;0.8349907994270325;it was also pointed out that this projected pickup in headline inflation was contingent on the shortterm outlook for energy prices which was highly uncertain
2016-11-17;2016;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.6172693967819214;in that context it was recalled that past shortterm inflation projections had been subject to considerable errors
2016-11-17;2016;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9902172088623047;members noted that measures of underlying inflation had remained broadly stable at low levels
2016-11-17;2016;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.7315121293067932;looking ahead it remained to be seen whether the low energy prices that had been observed until some months earlier might still exert secondround effects and pass through to core inflation
2016-11-17;2016;November;REPORT;Negative;0.7025618553161621;while lagged effects could not be excluded the risk of secondround effects from low energy prices in the past was now diminishing given the more recent uptick in energy prices
2016-11-17;2016;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.982894778251648;the extent of the passthrough critically hinged also on the pricesetting behaviour of firms
2016-11-17;2016;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9853730797767639;evidence suggested that firms had not fully passed on improvements in terms of trade to unit prices and it was important to monitor whether firms would adopt a symmetric pricesetting behaviour in response to the more recent increases in oil prices
2016-11-17;2016;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9881682991981506;in a discussion on developments in euro area wages several references were made to the relatively subdued wage dynamics as compensation per employee was growing at historically low rates falling to 11 in yearonyear terms in the second quarter of 2016 overall wage dynamics appeared to have surprised on the downside
2016-11-17;2016;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9930043816566467;low wage growth was explained by a number of countryspecific factors such as employmentoriented wage bargaining in some countries and the need to catch up on competiveness in others as well as low productivity growth which was affecting the euro area as a whole
2016-11-17;2016;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9866502285003662;it was also recalled in this context that the pattern of downside surprises on wage growth mirrored upside surprises in employment creation which was to be seen as a positive element in the euro area recovery
2016-11-17;2016;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.7825401425361633;members recalled the importance of a good understanding of the relationship between wages and inflation in conjunction with the margin behaviour of firms as had recently been highlighted in discussions concerning the us economy where a similar lack or delay of passthrough had been observed for some time
2016-11-17;2016;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8714742660522461;the relationship between the output gap and inflation was seen as subject to great uncertainty and as warranting continued monitoring and analysis
2016-11-17;2016;November;REPORT;Negative;0.8442578911781311;the point was made that the phillips curve relationship merited closer examination at the level of individual countries using not only hicp numbers but also other price indicators as the link between inflation and slack appeared to be unstable and rather diverse even across relatively similar neighbouring countries
2016-11-17;2016;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9378180503845215;as regards the risk assessment the prevalence of downside risks to the outlook for economic activity was seen to entail downside risks to the inflation outlook
2016-11-17;2016;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9766878485679626;some upside risks to inflation were also mentioned related to energy prices and exchange rate developments which in turn depended among other things on monetary policy decisions in other jurisdictions
2016-11-17;2016;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9847127199172974;with regard to the monetary analysis members concurred with the assessment presented by mr praet in his introduction
2016-11-17;2016;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9817684888839722;broad money m3 had continued to increase at a robust pace in august 2016 mainly supported as in previous months by its most liquid components
2016-11-17;2016;November;REPORT;Positive;0.8796417117118835;loan dynamics had continued on the path of gradual recovery observed since the beginning of 2014 with the growth of loans to nfcs and households in august progressing at levels unchanged from july
2016-11-17;2016;November;REPORT;Positive;0.7039756178855896;members stressed that the transmission of the monetary policy measures put in place since june 2014 continued to be effective in ensuring very favourable borrowing conditions for firms and households
2016-11-17;2016;November;REPORT;Positive;0.8518271446228027;in this context the tltros were mentioned which had led to substantial funding cost relief that banks were able to pass on to their customers despite a diverse takeup across euro area countries
2016-11-17;2016;November;REPORT;Negative;0.605805516242981;bank lending rates had continued their broadbased decline to new historic lows supporting the recovery of lending to the private sector
2016-11-17;2016;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9920448064804077;this was also confirmed by the results from the recent bank lending survey for the third quarter with banks reporting further improvements in both supply and demand conditions for loans to the nonfinancial private sector overall and in particular net loan demand increasing across all loan categories
2016-11-17;2016;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9931434392929077;credit conditions had also remained very favourable mainly on the back of increasing competitive pressures in the banking sector
2016-11-17;2016;November;REPORT;Negative;0.5346574783325195;credit standards had eased further for loans to households and after nine months of continued easing had been unchanged for nfcs although they were expected to tighten somewhat in the next quarter
2016-11-17;2016;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9791168570518494;furthermore banks continued to report that the ecbs app and the negative deposit facility rate had contributed to more favourable terms and conditions on new loans which overall saw a further net easing
2016-11-17;2016;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9243965148925781;at the same time continued monitoring of the state of policy transmission to the broader economy the bank lending channel and the outlook for loan developments appeared warranted
2016-11-17;2016;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9725840091705322;in addition the future evolution of credit standards and credit terms and conditions had to be monitored carefully
2016-11-17;2016;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9925040006637573;ongoing structural challenges to banks balance sheets notably arising from still high levels of nonperforming loans in parts of the euro area banking sector in conjunction with regulatory challenges and the weakness in profitability were seen to pose a risk to the transmission of monetary policy and a further recovery in credit dynamics
2016-11-17;2016;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9685646891593933;in this context the possible side effects of the low interest rate environment and the range of nonstandard measures in place on the longerterm intermediation capacity of banks and other financial institutions had to be further examined
2016-11-17;2016;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9908231496810913;regarding the outlook for credit growth some caution was warranted in view of the recent levellingoff of the growth of credit to nfcs
2016-11-17;2016;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9457352161407471;it was remarked that while the overall cost of external financing for nfcs had continued its steady decline particularly with regard to the cost of debt financing the cost of equity financing remained at high levels owing to elevated equity risk premia
2016-11-17;2016;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.4723294675350189;at the same time it was argued that the significance of recent monthly figures should not be overstated as the levellingoff was only evidenced by one monthly observation and incoming data over the coming months should provide a clearer picture of the trajectory of euro area credit looking ahead
2016-11-17;2016;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.7963447570800781;to date the recovery in the growth of loans to nfcs appeared to be broadly in line with the current moderate growth prospects of the euro area economy and the typical lags in the corporate lending cycle
2016-11-17;2016;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9938974976539612;moreover some slowdown was perhaps to be expected in economies approaching full employment where loan demand was likely to be dampened by the availability of ample internal funds as well as very favourable marketbased financing conditions
2016-11-17;2016;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9750456213951111;monetary policy stance and policy considerations with regard to the monetary policy stance members widely shared the assessment provided by mr praet in his introduction that the information that had become available since the monetary policy meeting in early september confirmed a continued moderate but steady recovery of the euro area economy and a gradual rise in inflation in line with the governing councils previous expectations
2016-11-17;2016;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9897139072418213;the euro area economy had continued to show resilience to the adverse effects of global economic and political uncertainty aided by the comprehensive monetary policy measures
2016-11-17;2016;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9088994264602661;at the same time the baseline scenario remained subject to downside risks
2016-11-17;2016;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8684321045875549;there was wide agreement among members that it was premature to make a firm assessment of the outlook for price stability and to discuss its implications for the monetary policy stance at the current meeting
2016-11-17;2016;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9542151093482971;while the recovery of the euro area economy appeared to be on track underlying inflation still lacked a convincing upward trend and the scenario for growth and inflation continued to be predicated on the prevailing very favourable financing conditions which to a large extent reflected the current accommodative monetary policy stance
2016-11-17;2016;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9363210797309875;in this context it was recalled that patience continued to be warranted as the full effects of the monetary policy measures were still unfolding given the transmission lags with which policy was feeding through to the ultimate objective and which in the wake of private and public sector balance sheet adjustments were likely to be longer than usual
2016-11-17;2016;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.7942414283752441;members widely agreed that in december the governing council would be in a better position to form a firmer view on the inflation outlook and the progress being made in achieving a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation with a view to considering the appropriate implications for the monetary policy stance
2016-11-17;2016;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8164867758750916;in december the governing council would have the benefit of the latest incoming data the new eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections extending through to 2019 and the results of the work of the eurosystem committees on the options to ensure the smooth implementation of the app until march 2017 or beyond if necessary
2016-11-17;2016;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9924633502960205;the view was widely shared among members that a discussion on the changes to the technical parameters of the app should not be separate from an assessment of the mediumterm inflation outlook and the implications this might have for the appropriate monetary policy stance
2016-11-17;2016;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9783696532249451;the questions of how to ensure the smooth implementation of the app until march 2017 or beyond if necessary and how to preserve the very substantial monetary support that was necessary in order to secure a return of inflation rates towards levels below but close to 2 were seen to be closely linked
2016-11-17;2016;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9845259189605713;members took note of the ongoing technical work of the committees that was designed to ensure a smooth execution of the programme until march 2017 or beyond if necessary
2016-11-17;2016;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9122673869132996;all in all members widely shared the view that it was imperative to remain fully committed to preserving the very substantial degree of monetary accommodation that was necessary to secure a sustained convergence of inflation towards levels below but close to 2 over the medium term
2016-11-17;2016;November;REPORT;Positive;0.7185835838317871;financing conditions had to remain supportive to underpin the recovery in growth and inflation also in the face of weak underlying price pressures and prevailing uncertainties
2016-11-17;2016;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9923765063285828;the governing council had to remain fully determined to execute its asset purchases in line with its past decisions and to adopt further measures if needed to put inflation back on a sustainable path towards levels compatible with its inflation aim
2016-11-17;2016;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.988897979259491;monetary policy decisions and communication as regards communication members broadly agreed with the proposals put forward by mr praet in his introduction
2016-11-17;2016;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.7287979125976562;a balanced communication was warranted which would provide reassurance about the governing councils commitment to preserve the very substantial amount of monetary support that was necessary to secure a return of inflation rates towards levels below but close to 2 without undue delay while at the same time being mindful not to trigger undue expectations in financial markets about future monetary policy action
2016-11-17;2016;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9944716691970825;accordingly the governing council should fully in line with its previous communication reiterate its forward guidance on asset purchases and policy rates whereby the monthly asset purchases of 80 billion were intended to run until the end of march 2017 or beyond if necessary and in any case until the governing council saw a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim
2016-11-17;2016;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9091662764549255;moreover policy rates continued to be expected to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases
2016-11-17;2016;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9780383110046387;to this end it was important to underline the governing councils ability and readiness to act if warranted to achieve its objective by using all the instruments available within its mandate
2016-11-17;2016;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9917299151420593;taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members on a proposal from the president the governing council decided to keep the interest rates on the eurosystems main refinancing operations the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility unchanged at 000 025 and 040 respectively
2016-11-17;2016;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9948256015777588;regarding nonstandard monetary policy measures the governing council confirmed that the monthly asset purchases of 80 billion were intended to run until the end of march 2017 or beyond if necessary and in any case until it saw a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim
