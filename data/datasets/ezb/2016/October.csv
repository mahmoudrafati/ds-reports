2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Negative;0.6825608611106873;members felt that the reasons behind the hesitant recovery in business investment needed to be better understood in conjunction with persistently high corporate savings the role of uncertainty and other factors such as technology and demographic developments
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9852476119995117;attention was drawn to the fact that crosscountry developments were uneven
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9918585419654846;it was pointed out that while output growth in some countries had exceeded expectations the level of gdp in other countries was still very low relative to precrisis levels
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.934274435043335;it was suggested that the structural reasons behind consistent subpar performance should be further examined and overall it was noted that there was still some way to go to reach sustainable convergence among euro area countries
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9860808849334717;reference was also made in the discussion to the continued existence of savings and investment imbalances at the euro area and country levels
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9945185780525208;the euro area current account surplus reflecting an excess of domestic saving over investment was seen as an indication of weak domestic demand
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9886825680732727;at the same time it was pointed out that in some small euro area countries stronger domestic demand had mainly led to higher import growth
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.988578200340271;moreover structural factors such as demographics were also deemed to play a role in explaining patterns in national savings and current account balances
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Negative;0.6840715408325195;overall the recovery in the euro area economy was expected to continue at a moderate but steady pace while the risks to the growth outlook were assessed to remain tilted to the downside related mainly to the external environment
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Positive;0.8464454412460327;against this background members again stressed that monetary policy on its own was not sufficient for a selfsustaining recovery and that there was a need for other policy areas to contribute much more decisively in supporting economic activity and potential growth
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8770385384559631;structural reforms were necessary in all euro area countries and implementation needed to be stepped up substantially in order to reduce the level of structural unemployment and to raise potential growth

2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Positive;0.7174811959266663;the swift and effective implementation of structural reforms would not only lead to higher sustainable economic growth in the euro area but would also make the euro area more resilient to external shocks
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9147242903709412;turning to fiscal policy members highlighted the need for compliance with the fiscal rules of the european union and reiterated that full and consistent implementation of the stability and growth pact over time and across countries remained crucial for confidence in the fiscal framework which was increasingly being challenged
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9923632144927979;concerns were expressed with regard to recent decisions at the european level that cast doubt on the functioning of the pact
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.5032871961593628;at the same time it was also recalled that a more growthfriendly composition of fiscal policies could support the economic recovery as could the use of fiscal space where available
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9370821714401245;it was stressed that the composition of government expenditure was at least as important as its size
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9855103492736816;with regard to price developments there was broad agreement with the assessment presented by mr praet in his introduction
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9687482118606567;headline inflation was expected to start rising in the coming months owing to upward base effects from energy prices and assumed oil price increases embedded in the futures curve
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8928455710411072;over the projection horizon inflation was expected to pick up further supported by the ecbs monetary policy measures and in line with the projected economic recovery
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9906869530677795;this assessment was reflected in the september 2016 ecb staff projections where the hicp inflation outlook was broadly unchanged in comparison with the june 2016 eurosystem staff projections
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.844357967376709;in discussing expected developments in inflation members noted that there was still no clear upward trend visible in measures of underlying inflation which remained low
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9914237856864929;according to the latest staff projections hicp inflation excluding food and energy and headline inflation were expected to converge in early 2017 at rates slightly above 1
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.6182113289833069;with regard to the prospect of a further increase in inflation beyond this period it was suggested that an important role would probably be played by services price inflation as nonenergy industrial goods prices were likely to continue to be affected by globalisation and could therefore be expected to remain subdued
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Positive;0.903082549571991;the expectation of higher services price inflation was supported by evidence linking developments in services prices with wage growth and by the expectation of more dynamic wage developments
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.982379138469696;it would thus be important to continue to follow developments in wages closely
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Negative;0.920963704586029;in this context it was noted that the projections expected a further decline in the unemployment rate to be only gradual which might understate the cyclical effect on the labour market of the ongoing recovery in activity
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9873817563056946;a number of remarks were made in relation to the risks surrounding the increase in inflation expected in the september 2016 staff projections
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.973388671875;in particular reference was made to the past sequence of overpredictions in the inflation projections which was seen as a downside risk to the baseline
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8896436095237732;concern was expressed that the standard models used to produce inflation forecasts were typically subject to meanreversion and it was noted that analysis of the inflation outlook using a range of phillips curves suggested that the projections although within a plausible range could be considered optimistic
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9933897256851196;the remark was also made that persistently low inflation in the euro area might start to affect expectations and make it harder for countries to regain competitiveness via relative price and wage adjustment as well as contribute to higher real interest rates and a higher real debt burden thereby dampening economic growth and inflation prospects
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.647361695766449;however it was also argued that there were good reasons to think that the past projection errors for inflation might not be repeated in the future
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9117883443832397;the impact of labour market reforms which might have dampened wage pressures in the past would fade over time and the effect of nominal rigidities which had prevented sharp corrections in wages during the crisis and led to a more protracted wage adjustment should also diminish
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9883197546005249;moreover there was a composition effect on wages linked to job creation in low productivity and low wage sectors which was unlikely to continue
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9753816723823547;it was also noted that oil prices were subject to considerable volatility and it was not easy to predict where they would stand in 2018 according to oil price futures oil prices in 2018 would still be below their 2015 level
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9787905812263489;it could thus be argued that there was a risk that oil prices would be higher than assumed in the projections and that energy price inflation might increase more than currently projected
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9866821765899658;members also considered recent developments in inflation expectations
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9930129647254944;it was highlighted that surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations such as the ecbs survey of professional forecasters were broadly unchanged for the period five years ahead at around 18
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9811804294586182;however while the average of point forecasts was stable the survey of professional forecasters also provided a probability distribution around the point forecasts which remained tilted to the downside
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9734054803848267;there had been a further decline in marketbased inflation expectations for the euro area since the governing councils previous monetary policy meeting the fiveyear forward inflationlinked swap rate five years ahead having fallen to around 13
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.860334038734436;this warranted close monitoring
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8807936310768127;it was also noted however that the probability of deflation had not increased and that market expectations were affected by international as well as domestic developments
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.5554223656654358;moreover it could not be ruled out that there might be some small positive effects on longerterm market expectations if actual inflation started to increase in the coming months
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9945084452629089;overall there was broad agreement that euro area inflation was expected to rise over the months ahead and that the outlook for inflation was broadly unchanged compared with the path implied in the june 2016 staff projections
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9847127199172974;with regard to the monetary analysis members concurred with the assessment presented by mr praet in his introduction
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9579511880874634;broad money m3 had continued to increase at a robust pace in july 2016 as in previous months annual growth in m3 had been mainly supported by its most liquid components and loan dynamics had continued on the path of gradual recovery observed since the beginning of 2014 members stressed that the effects of the monetary policy measures in place since june 2014 were continuing to filter through to support borrowing conditions for firms and households and thereby credit flows across the euro area
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9918984174728394;in particular the continued easing in marketbased financing conditions including banks funding conditions together with strong competitive pressure among lenders had all contributed to a further decline in bank lending rates including visàvis small and mediumsized enterprises
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9866291284561157;while the credit channel had continued to improve bank loan dynamics still remained moderate overall despite the substantial degree of monetary accommodation
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8055242300033569;therefore given the banking systems crucial importance for the transmission of monetary policy to the broader economy developments in the bank lending channel continued to deserve close monitoring as had been pointed out by mr praet in his introduction
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Negative;0.992602527141571;ongoing structural challenges related to banks balance sheets and the weakness in profitability continued to pose a risk to the transmission of monetary policy and the further recovery in credit dynamics
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Negative;0.8658760190010071;while bank earnings had been lower in the first quarter of 2016 than in the first quarter of 2015 when banks had benefited from valuation gains associated with the launch of the expanded app net interest income had still been holding up relatively well
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9919133186340332;however more recent indications pointed to a further decline in all three main revenue pillars namely interest income noninterest fee income and trading income
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9792683124542236;while this could in part be attributed to the low interest rate environment lower bank earnings were also due to provisioning related to the still high level of nonperforming loans in parts of the euro area banking sector and increased competition among banks
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9852900505065918;looking ahead further challenges could arise from regulatory and supervisory demands on banks in the coming months
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.49321141839027405;at the same time it was seen as important for the governing council to counter prevailing misperceptions regarding adverse implications for the banking sector of regulatory measures and supervisory action aimed at ensuring its stability and balance sheet sustainability
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Negative;0.752425491809845;in this regard it was of paramount importance to address the remaining structural weaknesses in the euro area banking sector where in particular bank lending should benefit from dealing effectively with nonperforming exposures
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9711999893188477;a healthier banking system should further support money and credit creation and enhance the effectiveness of the monetary policy measures in place
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9897966980934143;in this context it was also highlighted that bank profitability depended crucially on the further recovery in the euro area economy supporting an increase in still sluggish credit demand
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9936308264732361;as had already been noted at the governing councils previous monetary policy meeting the continued underperformance of bank equity prices also reflecting dampened earnings expectations had kept the cost of bank equity at elevated levels and might contain a cautionary signal for future loan growth
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.6219884753227234;while there appeared to be a close correlation between bank equity valuations and the growth rate of aggregate credit in the subsequent year it was considered difficult however to establish a clear causal link as a number of supply and demand factors played a role in determining bank equity prices and bank lending
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9159067869186401;monetary policy stance and policy considerations with regard to the monetary policy stance members widely shared the assessment provided by mr praet in his introduction that the incoming data continued to point to the euro area economys resilience to global and political uncertainty
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8608812093734741;accordingly and based on supportive financing conditions real gdp was expected to grow at a moderate but steady pace and euro area inflation to rise gradually in line with the path already embodied in the june 2016 eurosystem staff projections
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9891369342803955;yet downside risks remained and underlying inflation was still not showing convincing signs of a sustained pickup which warranted continued close monitoring of price trends and of economic and financial market developments
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9043765664100647;members widely agreed that policy action at the present meeting was not warranted and that the focus should remain on ensuring the full implementation of the policy measures so far decided
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9928937554359436;it was therefore seen as important to confirm the governing councils commitment to the monthly asset purchases of 80 billion which were intended to run until the end of march 2017 or beyond if necessary and in any case until the governing council saw a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9872690439224243;the comprehensive set of policy measures that had been adopted were seen as continuing to support favourable market and bankbased financing conditions
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9470992684364319;in particular the recently commenced cspp and tltroii were providing further significant funding cost relief to both nonfinancial corporations and banks
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Positive;0.6189489364624023;moreover market fragmentation had overall diminished markedly contributing to improvements in monetary policy transmission across the euro area
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9836241006851196;reference was made to the ongoing reduction in emergency liquidity assistance to banks in vulnerable euro area countries and the continued decline in spreads across euro area credit markets
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9816272854804993;however crosscountry differences in spreads were also seen to reflect still prevailing differences in countryspecific credit risk premia
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9798303842544556;while the substantial degree of monetary accommodation was swiftly reflected in financial market conditions it had not yet completely filtered through to final variables such as growth and inflation
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9850907325744629;it was recalled however that transmission lags with which policy passed through intermediate variables to the ultimate objective had to be taken into account
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Negative;0.6386239528656006;moreover in view of the private and public sector imbalances that had built up previously these lags were likely to be longer than usual and it would still take more time for the effects of the ecbs policy measures to unfold fully and reach the broader economy
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9849756360054016;overall confidence was expressed that the monetary policy measures were continuing to provide effective support to the cyclical recovery and the upward path in inflation
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9881570935249329;this was also reflected in the september 2016 ecb staff projections in which the measures taken in december 2015 and march 2016 were estimated to have a cumulated upward impact on real gdp growth of 06 percentage point and on inflation of 04 percentage point over the projection horizon
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9500898122787476;in this context it was highlighted that the projected path of inflation was conditional on exceptionally supportive financing conditions which to a large extent reflected the current accommodative monetary policy stance and prevailing market expectations about the future course of monetary policy
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9551057815551758;against this background and given remaining downside risks and uncertainties relating in particular to the external environment the view was widely shared that financing conditions had to remain supportive to underpin the recovery in growth and inflation
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.7229380011558533;it was therefore of crucial importance to preserve the very substantial degree of monetary support that was embedded in the staff projections while it was also cautioned that the governing council should not be unduly influenced by prevailing market expectations and that it had to remain fully focused on its commitment to achieve its price stability objective over the medium term
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9540880918502808;at the same time members reiterated their full commitment to bringing inflation back to levels in line with the governing councils mediumterm aim without undue delay
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9790562987327576;while the governing council needed to stay the course at the present meeting and give existing measures time to unfold it was important to reiterate its capacity and readiness to act if warranted to achieve its objective using all the instruments available within its mandate
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9782494306564331;members also discussed possible future challenges regarding the eurosystems ability to source sufficient eligible bonds in the market under the app and the request was made to the relevant eurosystem committees to further evaluate the options to ensure smooth implementation of the programme
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9800143241882324;the view was widely shared that reassurance had to be provided about the eurosystems ability to ensure the smooth implementation of the app and its capacity to deliver on its commitment that the programme would run until march 2017 or beyond if needed
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9881889820098877;it was underlined that the governing council could adjust the parameters of the programme at any time to achieve the intended amounts
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.5126533508300781;there should be no doubt about the governing councils determination to execute its asset purchases in line with its past decisions and to adopt further measures if needed to fulfil its price stability objective
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9895197153091431;finally a strong call was made for european policymakers to flank the ecbs accommodative monetary policy measures with adequate fiscal policies and structural reforms to achieve strong sustainable and balanced growth in line with the g20 policy commitments

2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9893452525138855;monetary policy decisions and communication as regards communication members widely agreed with the proposals presented by mr praet in his introduction
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Positive;0.7418425679206848;confidence had to be conveyed in the effectiveness of the ecbs monetary policy measures and the state of the euro area economy its resilience to global uncertainty and the baseline scenario for growth and inflation
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.959332287311554;in the light of the prevailing uncertainties it was also seen as important to reiterate that the governing council was monitoring economic and financial market developments very closely and that it was determined to preserve the very substantial degree of monetary accommodation that was necessary to secure a return of inflation to levels below but close to 2 over the medium term
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9831809401512146;finally great emphasis had to be placed on the governing councils willingness capacity and ability to act if warranted to achieve its objective by using all the instruments available within its mandate
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9917299151420593;taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members on a proposal from the president the governing council decided to keep the interest rates on the eurosystems main refinancing operations the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility unchanged at 000 025 and 040 respectively
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9254857897758484;the governing council continued to expect the key ecb interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases
2016-10-06;2016;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9948256015777588;regarding nonstandard monetary policy measures the governing council confirmed that the monthly asset purchases of 80 billion were intended to run until the end of march 2017 or beyond if necessary and in any case until it saw a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim
