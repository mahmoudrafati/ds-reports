2011-01-13;2011;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9794374108314514;accordingly the governing council will continue to monitor all developments over the period ahead very closely
2011-01-13;2011;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.935492992401123;let me now explain our assessment in greater detail starting with the economic analysis
2011-01-13;2011;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9918055534362793;following the 03 quarteronquarter increase in euro area real gdp in the third quarter of 2010 recent statistical releases and surveybased evidence confirm that the positive underlying momentum of economic activity in the euro area remained in place towards the end of 2010 looking ahead at 2011 euro area exports should benefit from a continued recovery in the world economy
2011-01-13;2011;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9904016852378845;at the same time and particularly taking into account the relatively high level of business confidence in the euro area private sector domestic demand should increasingly contribute to growth supported by the accommodative monetary policy stance and the measures adopted to restore the functioning of the financial system
2011-01-13;2011;January;REPORT;Negative;0.990675151348114;however the recovery in activity is expected to be dampened by the process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors
2011-01-13;2011;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9892323017120361;in the governing councils assessment the risks to this economic outlook are still slightly tilted to the downside with uncertainty remaining elevated
2011-01-13;2011;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9629034399986267;on the one hand global trade may continue to grow more rapidly than expected thereby supporting euro area exports
2011-01-13;2011;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9921438694000244;moreover strong business confidence could provide more support to domestic economic activity in the euro area than is currently expected
2011-01-13;2011;January;REPORT;Negative;0.983109176158905;on the other hand downside risks relate to the tensions in some segments of the financial markets and their potential spillover to the euro area real economy
2011-01-13;2011;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9889366626739502;further downside risks relate to renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices protectionist pressures and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances
2011-01-13;2011;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9898117184638977;with regard to price developments euro area annual hicp inflation was 22 in december according to eurostats flash estimate after 19 in november
2011-01-13;2011;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9158728718757629;this was somewhat higher than expected and largely reflects higher energy prices
2011-01-13;2011;January;REPORT;Negative;0.8483508825302124;looking ahead to the next few months inflation rates could temporarily increase further
2011-01-13;2011;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.714606761932373;they are likely to stay slightly above 2 largely owing to commodity price developments before moderating again towards the end of the year
2011-01-13;2011;January;REPORT;Negative;0.7764383554458618;overall we see evidence of shortterm upward pressure on overall inflation stemming largely from global commodity prices
2011-01-13;2011;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.95998215675354;while this has not so far affected our assessment that price developments will remain in line with price stability over the policyrelevant horizon very close monitoring of price developments is warranted

2011-01-13;2011;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.6288713216781616;upside risks relate in particular to developments in energy and nonenergy commodity prices
2011-01-13;2011;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9857884049415588;furthermore increases in indirect taxes and administered prices may be greater than currently expected owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years and price pressures in the production chain could rise further
2011-01-13;2011;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9757397174835205;on the downside risks relate mainly to the impact on inflation of potentially lower growth given the prevailing uncertainties
2011-01-13;2011;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9327279329299927;turning to the monetary analysis the annual growth rate of m3 increased to 19 in november 2010 after 09 in october
2011-01-13;2011;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.5661105513572693;this strong increase is in part related to base effects and volatile factors
2011-01-13;2011;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.8402324914932251;the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector also increased rising to 20 in november from 15 in october
2011-01-13;2011;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9464959502220154;looking beyond the special factors that operated in november broad money and loan growth is still low corroborating the assessment that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is moderate and that inflationary pressures over the medium term should remain contained
2011-01-13;2011;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.4242636561393738;the interest rate constellation continued to exert a significant impact on the growth of monetary aggregates
2011-01-13;2011;January;REPORT;Positive;0.826382040977478;looking at m3 components the interest rates paid on shortterm time deposits remained higher than those paid on overnight deposits
2011-01-13;2011;January;REPORT;Negative;0.896574079990387;as a result annual m1 growth continued to moderate standing at 46 in november 2010 while the annual growth rate of other shortterm deposits continued to become less negative
2011-01-13;2011;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9617987871170044;at the same time the yield curve has lately become steeper again implying that the attractiveness of shortterm deposits included in m3 has declined somewhat compared with more highly remunerated longerterm assets outside m3
2011-01-13;2011;January;REPORT;Negative;0.5432496070861816;the annual growth rate of bank loans to the private sector continued to increase in november partly owing to special factors
2011-01-13;2011;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9403350949287415;at the sectoral level this strengthening increasingly reflects the upward movement in the growth of loans to nonfinancial corporations which stood at 01 in november after 05 in october thereby further confirming that a turning point was reached in the course of 2010 the growth of loans to households remained stronger at 27 in november after 29 in october but the latest data point to some signs of a levellingoff
2011-01-13;2011;January;REPORT;Positive;0.7420957088470459;over the past few months banks have expanded the provision of credit to the private sector in an environment in which the overall size of their balance sheets has remained broadly stable
2011-01-13;2011;January;REPORT;Negative;0.985136091709137;the challenge remains to expand the availability of such credit when demand picks up further
2011-01-13;2011;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.8978808522224426;to address this challenge where necessary it is essential for banks to retain earnings to turn to the market to strengthen further their capital bases or to take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation
2011-01-13;2011;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9713043570518494;to sum up the current key ecb interest rates still remain appropriate
2011-01-13;2011;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.974777102470398;we therefore decided to leave them unchanged

2011-01-13;2011;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9919073581695557;turning to fiscal policies in view of the ongoing vulnerability to adverse market reactions countries need to do their utmost to meet their deficit targets and put government debttogdp ratios firmly on a downward trajectory
2011-01-13;2011;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9502313137054443;in this regard the governing council takes note of the recently announced measures in some euro area countries to reduce their very large fiscal imbalances

2011-01-13;2011;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9904500842094421;any positive fiscal developments that may emerge reflecting factors such as a more favourable than expected economic environment should be exploited to make faster progress with fiscal consolidation
2011-01-13;2011;January;REPORT;Positive;0.987585186958313;substantial and farreaching structural reforms complementing fiscal adjustment should be rapidly implemented to enhance the prospects for higher sustainable growth

2011-01-13;2011;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9813866019248962;increasing product market competition particularly in the services sectors would also facilitate the restructuring of the economy and encourage innovation
