2011-08-04;2011;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.935492992401123;let me now explain our assessment in greater detail starting with the economic analysis
2011-08-04;2011;August;REPORT;Positive;0.9868240356445312;in the first quarter of 2011 euro area real gdp posted a strong quarteronquarter increase of 08
2011-08-04;2011;August;REPORT;Positive;0.984667181968689;data and survey releases for the second quarter point towards ongoing real gdp growth albeit as expected at a slower pace
2011-08-04;2011;August;REPORT;Positive;0.8777661919593811;this moderation also reflects the fact that the strong growth in the first quarter was in part due to special factors
2011-08-04;2011;August;REPORT;Positive;0.9918670058250427;the underlying positive momentum of economic growth in the euro area remains in place and continued moderate expansion is expected in the period ahead
2011-08-04;2011;August;REPORT;Positive;0.976667046546936;euro area exports should continue to be supported by the ongoing expansion in the world economy
2011-08-04;2011;August;REPORT;Positive;0.9775424003601074;in addition the present level of consumer and business confidence in the euro area supports private sector domestic demand
2011-08-04;2011;August;REPORT;Negative;0.99396812915802;however growth dynamics are currently weakened by a number of factors contributing to uncertainty and activity is expected to be dampened somewhat by the ongoing process of balance sheet adjustment in various regions and sectors
2011-08-04;2011;August;REPORT;Negative;0.7257118225097656;in the governing councils assessment the risks to this economic outlook for the euro area remain broadly balanced in an environment of particularly high uncertainty
2011-08-04;2011;August;REPORT;Positive;0.9901965856552124;on the one hand consumer and business confidence together with improvements in labour market conditions could continue to provide support to domestic economic activity
2011-08-04;2011;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9852020144462585;on the other hand downside risks may have intensified
2011-08-04;2011;August;REPORT;Negative;0.968870997428894;they relate to the ongoing tensions in some segments of the euro area financial markets as well as to global developments and the potential for these pressures to spill over into the euro area real economy
2011-08-04;2011;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9840527772903442;downside risks also relate to further increases in energy prices protectionist pressures and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances
2011-08-04;2011;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9878278970718384;with regard to price developments euro area annual hicp inflation was 25 in july 2011 following 27 in june
2011-08-04;2011;August;REPORT;Negative;0.3860500156879425;the relatively high inflation rates seen over the past few months largely reflect higher energy and other commodity prices
2011-08-04;2011;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.8495479226112366;looking ahead inflation rates are likely to stay clearly above 2 over the coming months
2011-08-04;2011;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9543981552124023;upward pressure on inflation mainly from energy and other commodity prices is also still discernible in the earlier stages of the production process
2011-08-04;2011;August;REPORT;Negative;0.8904585838317871;it remains of paramount importance that the rise in hicp inflation does not translate into secondround effects in price and wagesetting behaviour and lead to broadbased inflationary pressures
2011-08-04;2011;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9935223460197449;inflation expectations must remain firmly anchored in line with the governing councils aim of maintaining inflation rates below but close to 2 over the medium term
2011-08-04;2011;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9529158473014832;risks to the mediumterm outlook for price developments remain on the upside
2011-08-04;2011;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.8107038140296936;they relate in particular to higher than assumed increases in energy prices
2011-08-04;2011;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9429582953453064;furthermore there is a risk of increases in indirect taxes and administered prices that may be greater than currently assumed owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years
2011-08-04;2011;August;REPORT;Positive;0.9041308164596558;finally upside risks may stem from stronger than expected domestic price pressures in the euro area
2011-08-04;2011;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9023534655570984;turning to the monetary analysis the annual growth rate of m3 decreased to 21 in june 2011 from 25 in may
2011-08-04;2011;August;REPORT;Negative;0.8884385228157043;looking through the recent monthly volatility m3 growth has broadly stabilised over recent months after edging up until the first quarter of 2011 the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector declined to 25 in june from 27 in may
2011-08-04;2011;August;REPORT;Negative;0.8589603900909424;overall the underlying pace of monetary expansion remains moderate
2011-08-04;2011;August;REPORT;Positive;0.9377871155738831;at the same time monetary liquidity accumulated prior to the period of financial market tensions continues to be ample and may facilitate the accommodation of price pressures in the euro area
2011-08-04;2011;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.8683301210403442;looking at m3 components the annual growth rate of m1 remained unchanged at 12 whereas growth in other shortterm deposits declined to 37
2011-08-04;2011;August;REPORT;Positive;0.9305459856987;the growth differentials continue to reflect in part the gradual increase in the remuneration of shortterm time and savings deposits over recent months
2011-08-04;2011;August;REPORT;Negative;0.982163667678833;at the same time the still relatively steep yield curve implies a dampening impact on overall m3 growth as it reduces the attractiveness of monetary assets compared with more highly remunerated longerterm instruments outside m3
2011-08-04;2011;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9789143800735474;however this impact is likely to be waning
2011-08-04;2011;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9292261004447937;on the counterpart side the annual growth of loans to nonfinancial corporations continued to edge up from 09 in may to 15 in june whereas the annual growth of loans to households hovered over recent months around rates of slightly above 3
2011-08-04;2011;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9892488718032837;the overall size of mfi balance sheets has remained broadly unchanged over recent months
2011-08-04;2011;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9613640308380127;where it is necessary to provide adequate scope to expand the provision of credit to the private sector it is essential for banks to retain earnings to turn to the market to strengthen further their capital bases or to take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation
2011-08-04;2011;August;REPORT;Negative;0.8479670286178589;in particular banks that currently have limited access to market financing urgently need to increase their capital and their efficiency
2011-08-04;2011;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9766823053359985;in this respect we welcome the euwide stresstesting exercise which was prepared by the european banking authority and national supervisors in close cooperation with the ecb
2011-08-04;2011;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9822756052017212;we also welcome the commitment made by national authorities with regard to the provision of support facilities for banks where private sector means are insufficient
2011-08-04;2011;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9589940905570984;to sum up based on its regular economic and monetary analyses the governing council decided to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged following the 25 basis point increase on 7 july 2011 the information that has become available since then confirms our assessment that an adjustment of the accommodative monetary policy stance was warranted in the light of upside risks to price stability
2011-08-04;2011;August;REPORT;Positive;0.9724385738372803;a crosscheck with the signals coming from the monetary analysis indicates that while the underlying pace of monetary expansion is still moderate monetary liquidity remains ample and may facilitate the accommodation of price pressures
2011-08-04;2011;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9921579360961914;as expected recent economic data indicate a deceleration in the pace of economic growth in the past few months following the strong growth rate in the first quarter

2011-08-04;2011;August;REPORT;Negative;0.8473788499832153;turning to fiscal policies the governing council stresses the need for strict and timely implementation of the imfeu adjustment programmes in greece ireland and portugal
2011-08-04;2011;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9877464771270752;in addition it underlines the importance of the renewed commitment of all heads of state or government of the euro area to adhere strictly to the agreed fiscal targets
2011-08-04;2011;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9648327231407166;for several countries this requires announcing and implementing additional and more frontloaded fiscal adjustment measures
2011-08-04;2011;August;REPORT;Positive;0.986020028591156;those that enjoy better than expected economic and fiscal developments should make full use of this room for manoeuvre for faster deficit and debt reduction
2011-08-04;2011;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9170790910720825;the common aim should be to put public debt ratios and public finances on a sustainable path as soon as possible
2011-08-04;2011;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.6065555214881897;as emphasised by the heads of state or government of the euro area the inflexible determination of all euro area countries to fully honour their own individual sovereign signature is a decisive element in ensuring financial stability in the euro area as a whole
2011-08-04;2011;August;REPORT;Positive;0.9696525931358337;the governing council also welcomes the renewed commitment of all member states to improve competitiveness and address macroeconomic imbalances
2011-08-04;2011;August;REPORT;Positive;0.852206289768219;indeed substantial and comprehensive structural reforms need to be implemented in the countries of the euro area in order to increase the flexibility of their economies and their longerterm growth potential
