2011-07-07;2011;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.945464551448822;we will continue to monitor very closely all developments with respect to upside risks to price stability
2011-07-07;2011;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9896653294563293;the provision of liquidity and the allotment modes for refinancing operations will be adjusted when appropriate taking into account the fact that all the nonstandard measures taken during the period of acute financial market tensions are by construction temporary in nature
2011-07-07;2011;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.935492992401123;let me now explain our assessment in greater detail starting with the economic analysis
2011-07-07;2011;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9916551113128662;in the first quarter of 2011 euro area real gdp posted a strong quarteronquarter increase of 08 following the 03 increase in the last quarter of 2010 recent statistical releases and surveybased indicators point towards a continued expansion of economic activity in the euro area in the second quarter of this year albeit at a slower pace
2011-07-07;2011;July;REPORT;Positive;0.7905407547950745;this moderation reflects the fact that the strong growth in the first quarter was in part due to special factors
2011-07-07;2011;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9917646050453186;the positive underlying momentum of economic activity in the euro area remains in place
2011-07-07;2011;July;REPORT;Positive;0.976667046546936;euro area exports should continue to be supported by the ongoing expansion in the world economy
2011-07-07;2011;July;REPORT;Positive;0.989578902721405;at the same time taking into account the present level of business confidence in the euro area private sector domestic demand should contribute to economic growth
2011-07-07;2011;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9867371916770935;however activity is expected to continue to be dampened somewhat by the process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors
2011-07-07;2011;July;REPORT;Negative;0.5374129414558411;in the governing councils assessment the risks to this economic outlook remain broadly balanced in an environment of elevated uncertainty
2011-07-07;2011;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9904600381851196;on the one hand favourable business confidence could provide more support to domestic economic activity in the euro area than currently expected and higher foreign demand could also contribute more strongly to growth than expected
2011-07-07;2011;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9826319217681885;on the other hand downside risks relate to the ongoing tensions in some segments of the financial markets that may potentially spill over to the euro area real economy
2011-07-07;2011;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9840527772903442;downside risks also relate to further increases in energy prices protectionist pressures and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances
2011-07-07;2011;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9907637238502502;with regard to price developments euro area annual hicp inflation was 27 in june 2011 according to eurostats flash estimate  the same rate as in may
2011-07-07;2011;July;REPORT;Negative;0.44575631618499756;the relatively high inflation rates seen over the past few months largely reflect higher energy and commodity prices
2011-07-07;2011;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8495479226112366;looking ahead inflation rates are likely to stay clearly above 2 over the coming months
2011-07-07;2011;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9706383347511292;upward pressure on inflation mainly from energy and commodity prices is also still discernible in the earlier stages of the production process
2011-07-07;2011;July;REPORT;Negative;0.8904585838317871;it remains of paramount importance that the rise in hicp inflation does not translate into secondround effects in price and wagesetting behaviour and lead to broadbased inflationary pressures
2011-07-07;2011;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9935223460197449;inflation expectations must remain firmly anchored in line with the governing councils aim of maintaining inflation rates below but close to 2 over the medium term
2011-07-07;2011;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9529158473014832;risks to the mediumterm outlook for price developments remain on the upside
2011-07-07;2011;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8107038140296936;they relate in particular to higher than assumed increases in energy prices
2011-07-07;2011;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9429582953453064;furthermore there is a risk of increases in indirect taxes and administered prices that may be greater than currently assumed owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years
2011-07-07;2011;July;REPORT;Positive;0.8996186852455139;finally upside risks may stem from stronger than expected domestic price pressures in the context of increasing capacity utilisation in the euro area
2011-07-07;2011;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9082775712013245;turning to the monetary analysis the annual growth rate of m3 increased to 24 in may 2011 from 20 in april
2011-07-07;2011;July;REPORT;Negative;0.8811438083648682;looking through the recent volatility in broad money growth owing to special factors m3 growth has continued to edge up over recent months

2011-07-07;2011;July;REPORT;Positive;0.8654236793518066;these developments reflect in part the gradual increase in the remuneration of shortterm time and savings deposits over recent months
2011-07-07;2011;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9812018871307373;at the same time the steep yield curve implies a dampening impact on overall m3 growth as it reduces the attractiveness of monetary assets compared with more highly remunerated longerterm instruments outside m3
2011-07-07;2011;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9871314764022827;however recent information suggests that this impact may be waning

2011-07-07;2011;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8978808522224426;to address this challenge where necessary it is essential for banks to retain earnings to turn to the market to strengthen further their capital bases or to take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation
2011-07-07;2011;July;REPORT;Negative;0.8479670286178589;in particular banks that currently have limited access to market financing urgently need to increase their capital and their efficiency

2011-07-07;2011;July;REPORT;Negative;0.7050293684005737;the further adjustment of the current accommodative monetary policy stance is warranted in the light of upside risks to price stability
2011-07-07;2011;July;REPORT;Positive;0.8954058885574341;a crosscheck of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis indicates that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is continuing to gradually recover while monetary liquidity remains ample with the potential to accommodate price pressures in the euro area
2011-07-07;2011;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8372843861579895;all in all it is essential that the recent price developments do not give rise to broadbased inflationary pressures over the medium term

2011-07-07;2011;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9902499318122864;adequate and more frontloaded adjustment should ensure that structural fiscal consolidation targets are met in line with the ecofin council recommendations and any better than expected economic and fiscal developments should be exploited to achieve faster deficit reduction
2011-07-07;2011;July;REPORT;Positive;0.7565107941627502;the announcement of fully specified consolidation measures for 2012 and beyond is essential to convince the general public and financial market participants that the corrective policies will be sustained and that public debt developments will be put on a sustainable path
2011-07-07;2011;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9700356125831604;at the same time it remains essential that substantial and comprehensive structural reforms are urgently implemented in the euro area to strengthen competitiveness flexibility and longerterm growth potential
