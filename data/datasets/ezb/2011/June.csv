2011-06-09;2011;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.772233784198761;we will do all that is needed to prevent recent price developments giving rise to broadbased inflationary pressures
2011-06-09;2011;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.597277820110321;we remain strongly determined to secure a firm anchoring of inflation expectations in the euro area in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below but close to 2 over the medium term
2011-06-09;2011;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.8325346112251282;this is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting growth and job creation in the euro area
2011-06-09;2011;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9891310930252075;the governing council today also decided to continue conducting its main refinancing operations mros as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as necessary and at least until the end of the ninth maintenance period of 2011 on 11 october 2011 this procedure will also remain in use for the eurosystems specialterm refinancing operations with a maturity of one maintenance period which will continue to be conducted for as long as needed and at least until the end of the third quarter of 2011 the fixed rate in these specialterm refinancing operations will be the same as the mro rate prevailing at the time
2011-06-09;2011;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9864948987960815;furthermore the governing council decided to conduct the threemonth longerterm refinancing operations ltros to be allotted on 27 july 31 august and 28 september 2011 as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment

2011-06-09;2011;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9874783754348755;as stated on previous occasions the provision of liquidity and the allotment modes for refinancing operations will be adjusted when appropriate taking into account the fact that all the nonstandard measures taken during the period of acute financial market tensions are by construction temporary in nature
2011-06-09;2011;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.935492992401123;let me now explain our assessment in greater detail starting with the economic analysis
2011-06-09;2011;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9919036030769348;in the first quarter of 2011 the euro area recorded strong real gdp growth of 08 quarteronquarter following the 03 increase of the fourth quarter of 2010 recent statistical releases and surveybased indicators point towards a continued expansion of economic activity in the euro area in the second quarter of this year albeit at a slower pace
2011-06-09;2011;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9693061709403992;this easing reflects the fact that the strong growth in the first quarter was partly due to special factors which will cease to play a role in the second quarter
2011-06-09;2011;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9139763116836548;hence it is appropriate to look through such shortterm volatility and to emphasise the positive underlying momentum of economic activity in the euro area
2011-06-09;2011;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9804425835609436;looking ahead euro area exports should be supported by the ongoing expansion in the world economy
2011-06-09;2011;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9916737675666809;at the same time taking into account the favourable level of business confidence in the euro area private sector domestic demand should contribute increasingly to economic growth benefiting from the still accommodative monetary policy stance and the measures adopted to improve the functioning of the financial system
2011-06-09;2011;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9867371916770935;however activity is expected to continue to be dampened somewhat by the process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors
2011-06-09;2011;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9888916611671448;this assessment is also reflected in the june 2011 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area which foresee annual real gdp growth in a range between 15 and 23  in 2011 and between 06  and 28 in 2012 compared with the march 2011 ecb staff macroeconomic projections the range for 2011 has been revised upwards while the range for 2012 remains broadly unchanged
2011-06-09;2011;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9860675930976868;the june 2011 eurosystem staff projections are broadly in line with recent forecasts by international organisations
2011-06-09;2011;June;REPORT;Negative;0.5374129414558411;in the governing councils assessment the risks to this economic outlook remain broadly balanced in an environment of elevated uncertainty
2011-06-09;2011;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9904600381851196;on the one hand favourable business confidence could provide more support to domestic economic activity in the euro area than currently expected and higher foreign demand could also contribute more strongly to growth than expected
2011-06-09;2011;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9826319217681885;on the other hand downside risks relate to the ongoing tensions in some segments of the financial markets that may potentially spill over to the euro area real economy
2011-06-09;2011;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9840527772903442;downside risks also relate to further increases in energy prices protectionist pressures and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances
2011-06-09;2011;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9901875853538513;with regard to price developments euro area annual hicp inflation was 27 in may according to eurostats flash estimate after 28 in april
2011-06-09;2011;June;REPORT;Negative;0.44575631618499756;the relatively high inflation rates seen over the past few months largely reflect higher energy and commodity prices
2011-06-09;2011;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.8495479226112366;looking ahead inflation rates are likely to stay clearly above 2 over the coming months
2011-06-09;2011;June;REPORT;Negative;0.5216724872589111;upward pressure on inflation mainly from energy and commodity prices is also discernible in the earlier stages of the production process
2011-06-09;2011;June;REPORT;Negative;0.8904585838317871;it remains of paramount importance that the rise in hicp inflation does not translate into secondround effects in price and wagesetting behaviour and lead to broadbased inflationary pressures
2011-06-09;2011;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9935223460197449;inflation expectations must remain firmly anchored in line with the governing councils aim of maintaining inflation rates below but close to 2 over the medium term
2011-06-09;2011;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9813368916511536;the june 2011 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area foresee annual hicp inflation in a range between 25 and 27 for 2011 and between 11 and 23 for 2012 in comparison with the march 2011 ecb staff macroeconomic projections the range for hicp inflation in 2011 has been revised upwards largely reflecting higher energy prices
2011-06-09;2011;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.5786635875701904;the projection range for 2012 has narrowed somewhat
2011-06-09;2011;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9838365912437439;it is appropriate to recall that the staff projections are conditional on a number of purely technical assumptions including oil prices interest rates and exchange rates
2011-06-09;2011;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.8910292387008667;in particular it is assumed that oil prices will decline somewhat and that shortterm interest rates will rise in accordance with market expectations
2011-06-09;2011;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9777766466140747;overall the projections embody the view that the recent high rates of inflation do not lead to broaderbased inflationary pressure in the euro area
2011-06-09;2011;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9529158473014832;risks to the mediumterm outlook for price developments remain on the upside
2011-06-09;2011;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.8107038140296936;they relate in particular to higher than assumed increases in energy prices
2011-06-09;2011;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9429582953453064;furthermore there is a risk of increases in indirect taxes and administered prices that may be greater than currently assumed owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years
2011-06-09;2011;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9283768534660339;finally upside risks may come from stronger than expected domestic price pressures in the context of increasing capacity utilisation in the euro area
2011-06-09;2011;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9798413515090942;turning to the monetary analysis the annual growth rate of m3 was 20 in april 2011 after 23 in march
2011-06-09;2011;June;REPORT;Negative;0.8167291283607483;looking through the recent volatility in broad money growth m3 growth has continued to edge up over recent months
2011-06-09;2011;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.5158171057701111;the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector strengthened slightly to 26 in april after 25 in march
2011-06-09;2011;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9762692451477051;overall the underlying pace of monetary expansion is gradually recovering
2011-06-09;2011;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9521211385726929;at the same time monetary liquidity accumulated prior to the period of financial market tensions remains ample with the potential to accommodate price pressures in the euro area
2011-06-09;2011;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9722052812576294;looking at m3 components the annual growth rate of m1 decreased in april while that of other shortterm deposits increased
2011-06-09;2011;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.8513930439949036;the development partly reflects the gradual increase in the remuneration of these deposits over recent months
2011-06-09;2011;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9812018871307373;at the same time the steep yield curve implies a dampening impact on overall m3 growth as it reduces the attractiveness of monetary assets compared with more highly remunerated longerterm instruments outside m3
2011-06-09;2011;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9719815254211426;however available information suggests that this impact may be waning
2011-06-09;2011;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9841230511665344;on the counterpart side there has been a further slight strengthening in the growth of loans to nonfinancial corporations which rose to 10 in april after 08 in march

2011-06-09;2011;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9878193140029907;the overall size of bank balance sheets has remained broadly unchanged over the past few months notwithstanding some volatility
2011-06-09;2011;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9724864959716797;it is important that banks continue to expand the provision of credit to the private sector in an environment of increasing demand
2011-06-09;2011;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.8978808522224426;to address this challenge where necessary it is essential for banks to retain earnings to turn to the market to strengthen further their capital bases or to take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation
2011-06-09;2011;June;REPORT;Negative;0.8479670286178589;in particular banks that currently have limited access to market financing urgently need to increase their capital and their efficiency
2011-06-09;2011;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9930598735809326;to sum up based on its regular economic and monetary analyses the governing council decided to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged

2011-06-09;2011;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9836523532867432;turning to fiscal policies all parties involved in the preparation of the 2012 national budgets must ensure that they are fully in line with the requirement to support confidence in fiscal policies
2011-06-09;2011;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9761462211608887;a comparison between the latest economic forecasts by the european commission and the fiscal plans embodied in the stability programmes points to the need for many countries to underpin their budget targets with concrete consolidation measures in order to correct their excessive deficits by the commonly agreed deadlines
2011-06-09;2011;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9209538698196411;the implementation of credible fiscal adjustment strategies is crucial in view of ongoing financial market pressures
