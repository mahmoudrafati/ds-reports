2011-02-03;2011;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9794374108314514;accordingly the governing council will continue to monitor all developments over the period ahead very closely
2011-02-03;2011;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.935492992401123;let me now explain our assessment in greater detail starting with the economic analysis
2011-02-03;2011;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9918088316917419;following the 03 quarteronquarter increase in euro area real gdp in the third quarter of 2010 recent statistical releases and surveybased evidence for the fourth quarter and the beginning of the year continue to confirm the positive underlying momentum of economic activity in the euro area
2011-02-03;2011;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9928120970726013;looking ahead euro area exports should benefit from the ongoing recovery in the world economy
2011-02-03;2011;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9897786974906921;at the same time taking into account the relatively high level of business confidence in the euro area private sector domestic demand should increasingly contribute to growth supported by the accommodative monetary policy stance and the measures adopted to improve the functioning of the financial system
2011-02-03;2011;February;REPORT;Negative;0.990675151348114;however the recovery in activity is expected to be dampened by the process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors
2011-02-03;2011;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9757078289985657;in the governing councils assessment the risks to this economic outlook are still slightly tilted to the downside while uncertainty remains elevated
2011-02-03;2011;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9629034399986267;on the one hand global trade may continue to grow more rapidly than expected thereby supporting euro area exports
2011-02-03;2011;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9921438694000244;moreover strong business confidence could provide more support to domestic economic activity in the euro area than is currently expected
2011-02-03;2011;February;REPORT;Negative;0.983109176158905;on the other hand downside risks relate to the tensions in some segments of the financial markets and their potential spillover to the euro area real economy
2011-02-03;2011;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9889366626739502;further downside risks relate to renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices protectionist pressures and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances

2011-02-03;2011;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9625526666641235;this further increase was broadly anticipated and largely reflects higher energy prices
2011-02-03;2011;February;REPORT;Negative;0.5574597716331482;looking ahead to the next few months inflation rates could temporarily increase further and are likely to stay slightly above 2 for most of 2011 before moderating again around the turn of the year
2011-02-03;2011;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9707207083702087;overall we continue to see evidence of shortterm upward pressure on overall inflation mainly owing to energy and commodity prices
2011-02-03;2011;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.923426628112793;such pressure is also discernible in the earlier stages of the production process
2011-02-03;2011;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9802163243293762;these developments have not so far affected our assessment that price developments will remain in line with price stability over the policyrelevant horizon
2011-02-03;2011;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9068387746810913;at the same time very close monitoring is warranted
2011-02-03;2011;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9922731518745422;inflation expectations over the medium to longer term continue to be firmly anchored in line with the governing councils aim of keeping inflation rates below but close to 2 over the medium term
2011-02-03;2011;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9444125890731812;risks to the mediumterm outlook for price developments are still broadly balanced but as already indicated in january could move to the upside
2011-02-03;2011;February;REPORT;Negative;0.567818284034729;currently upside risks relate in particular to developments in energy and nonenergy commodity prices
2011-02-03;2011;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9857884049415588;furthermore increases in indirect taxes and administered prices may be greater than currently expected owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years and price pressures in the production chain could rise further
2011-02-03;2011;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9757397174835205;on the downside risks relate mainly to the impact on inflation of potentially lower growth given the prevailing uncertainties
2011-02-03;2011;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.6732677817344666;turning to the monetary analysis the annual growth rate of m3 declined to 17 in december 2010 from 21 in november

2011-02-03;2011;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9826866388320923;these declines partly reflect the reversal of special factors that operated in november and do not indicate a general weakening of monetary dynamics
2011-02-03;2011;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9849281907081604;overall however broad money and loan growth is still low confirming the assessment that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is moderate and that inflationary pressures over the medium to long term should remain contained
2011-02-03;2011;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9892549514770508;looking at m3 components annual m1 growth moderated further to stand at 44 in december 2010 reflecting the prevailing low remuneration of overnight deposits
2011-02-03;2011;February;REPORT;Negative;0.5131115317344666;at the same time the yield curve has steepened somewhat further implying that the attractiveness of shortterm instruments included in m3 continues to decline compared with more highly remunerated longerterm instruments outside m3
2011-02-03;2011;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8994434475898743;on the counterpart side the annual growth rate of bank loans to the private sector continued to conceal differences in the magnitude of growth across sectors

2011-02-03;2011;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8710723519325256;at the same time the latest data point to the overall size of bank balance sheets having contracted again after expanding for most of 2010 mainly on account of a reduction in lending between banks
2011-02-03;2011;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9724864959716797;it is important that banks continue to expand the provision of credit to the private sector in an environment of increasing demand
2011-02-03;2011;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8978808522224426;to address this challenge where necessary it is essential for banks to retain earnings to turn to the market to strengthen further their capital bases or to take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation
2011-02-03;2011;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9713043570518494;to sum up the current key ecb interest rates still remain appropriate

2011-02-03;2011;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9854538440704346;a crosscheck of the outcome of our economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis indicates that inflationary pressures over the medium to long term should remain contained

2011-02-03;2011;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9889783263206482;such a commitment helps to strengthen confidence in the sustainability of public finances reduces interest rate risk premia and improves the conditions for sound and sustainable growth
