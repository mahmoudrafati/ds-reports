2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9639865159988403;let me now start reporting on the outcome of todays meeting
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9883795976638794;based on its regular economic and monetary analyses the governing council decided to increase the key ecb interest rates by 25 basis points after maintaining them unchanged for almost two years at historically low levels
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8707671165466309;the adjustment of the current very accommodative monetary policy stance is warranted in the light of upside risks to price stability that we have identified in our economic analysis
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9770210385322571;while our monetary analysis indicates that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is still moderate monetary liquidity remains ample and may facilitate the accommodation of price pressures
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8372843861579895;all in all it is essential that the recent price developments do not give rise to broadbased inflationary pressures over the medium term
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9875056743621826;our decision will contribute to keeping inflation expectations in the euro area firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below but close to 2 over the medium term
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9853253960609436;such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to contribute to economic growth in the euro area
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9631337523460388;at the same time interest rates across the entire maturity spectrum remain low
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9650583863258362;thus the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and thereby continues to lend considerable support to economic activity and job creation
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9907886385917664;recent economic data confirm that the underlying momentum of economic activity continues to be positive with uncertainty remaining elevated
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.945464551448822;we will continue to monitor very closely all developments with respect to upside risks to price stability
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9874512553215027;as stated on previous occasions the provision of liquidity and the allotment modes for refinancing operations will also be adjusted when appropriate taking into account the fact that all the nonstandard measures taken during the period of acute financial market tensions are by construction temporary in nature
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9794374108314514;accordingly the governing council will continue to monitor all developments over the period ahead very closely
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.935492992401123;let me now explain our assessment in greater detail starting with the economic analysis
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9918445944786072;following the 03 quarteronquarter increase in euro area real gdp in the fourth quarter of 2010 recent statistical releases and surveybased indicators point towards a continued positive underlying momentum of economic activity in the euro area in early 2011 looking ahead euro area exports should be supported by the ongoing recovery in the world economy
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9914862513542175;at the same time taking into account the relatively high level of business confidence in the euro area private sector domestic demand should increasingly contribute to economic growth benefiting from the accommodative monetary policy stance and the measures adopted to improve the functioning of the financial system
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9897029995918274;however the recovery in activity is expected to be dampened somewhat by the process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Negative;0.5374129414558411;in the governing councils assessment the risks to this economic outlook remain broadly balanced in an environment of elevated uncertainty
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9629034399986267;on the one hand global trade may continue to grow more rapidly than expected thereby supporting euro area exports
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9922641515731812;moreover continued strong business confidence could provide more support to domestic economic activity in the euro area than currently expected
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9826319217681885;on the other hand downside risks relate to the ongoing tensions in some segments of the financial markets that may potentially spill over to the euro area real economy
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9833891987800598;downside risks also relate to further increases in energy prices in particular in view of ongoing geopolitical tensions and to protectionist pressures and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9681402444839478;finally there are potential risks stemming from the economic impact on the euro area and elsewhere of the recent natural and nuclear disaster in japan
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9902614951133728;with regard to price developments euro area annual hicp inflation was 26 in march 2011 according to eurostats flash estimate after 24  in february
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.5413637161254883;the increase in inflation rates in early 2011 largely reflects higher commodity prices
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9482240080833435;pressure stemming from the sharp increases in energy and food prices is also discernible in the earlier stages of the production process
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8865758776664734;it is of paramount importance that the rise in hicp inflation does not lead to secondround effects in price and wagesetting behaviour and thereby give rise to broadbased inflationary pressures over the medium term
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9935223460197449;inflation expectations must remain firmly anchored in line with the governing councils aim of maintaining inflation rates below but close to 2 over the medium term
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9529158473014832;risks to the mediumterm outlook for price developments remain on the upside
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.5574028491973877;they relate in particular to higher than assumed increases in energy prices not least owing to ongoing political tensions in north africa and the middle east
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9911382794380188;more generally strong economic growth in emerging markets supported by ample liquidity at the global level may further fuel commodity price rises
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.5745881795883179;moreover increases in indirect taxes and administered prices may be greater than currently assumed owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Positive;0.8364637494087219;finally risks also relate to stronger than expected domestic price pressures in the context of the ongoing recovery in activity
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9047588109970093;turning to the monetary analysis the annual growth rate of m3 increased to 20 in february 2011 from 15 in january
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Negative;0.8811438083648682;looking through the recent volatility in broad money growth owing to special factors m3 growth has continued to edge up over recent months
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Positive;0.7565723657608032;the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector also increased further to 26 in february from 24 in the previous month
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9804302453994751;hence the underlying pace of monetary expansion is gradually picking up but remains moderate
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9598109722137451;at the same time monetary liquidity accumulated prior to the period of financial market tensions remains ample and may facilitate the accommodation of price pressures in the euro area
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Negative;0.6921412348747253;looking at m3 components annual m1 growth moderated further to 29 in february 2011 while the growth of other shortterm deposits and marketable instruments has increased
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9874327778816223;this rebalancing within m3 reflects the impact of the recent steepening of the yield curve on the remuneration of different monetary assets
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9797802567481995;however this steeper yield curve also implies a dampening impact on overall m3 growth as it reduces the attractiveness of monetary assets compared with more highly remunerated longerterm instruments outside m3
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9832221865653992;on the counterpart side a further rise in the annual growth rate of bank loans to the private sector in february is due in part to a further slight strengthening in the growth of loans to nonfinancial corporations which rose to 06 in february after 05 in january
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8809759616851807;the growth of loans to households was 30 in february compared with 31 in january
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9672757387161255;overall in early 2011 the positive flow of lending to the nonfinancial private sector has become more broadly based across the household and nonfinancial corporation sectors
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9369363188743591;the latest data confirm that banks have expanded their lending to the private sector further while at the same time the overall size of their balance sheets has remained broadly unchanged
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9724864959716797;it is important that banks continue to expand the provision of credit to the private sector in an environment of increasing demand
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8978808522224426;to address this challenge where necessary it is essential for banks to retain earnings to turn to the market to strengthen further their capital bases or to take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Negative;0.8479670286178589;in particular banks that currently have limited access to market financing urgently need to increase their capital and their efficiency
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9901400208473206;to sum up the governing council decided to increase the key ecb interest rates by 25 basis points
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8707671165466309;the adjustment of the current very accommodative monetary policy stance is warranted in the light of upside risks to price stability that we have identified in our economic analysis
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9759626984596252;a crosscheck with the signals from our monetary analysis indicates that while the underlying pace of monetary expansion is still moderate monetary liquidity remains ample and may facilitate the accommodation of price pressures
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8372843861579895;all in all it is essential that the recent price developments do not give rise to broadbased inflationary pressures over the medium term
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9875056743621826;our decision will contribute to keeping inflation expectations in the euro area firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below but close to 2 over the medium term
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9853253960609436;such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to contribute to economic growth in the euro area
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9631337523460388;at the same time interest rates across the entire maturity spectrum remain low
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9650583863258362;thus the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and thereby continues to lend considerable support to economic activity and job creation
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9907886385917664;recent economic data confirm that the underlying momentum of economic activity continues to be positive with uncertainty remaining elevated
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.945464551448822;we will continue to monitor very closely all developments with respect to upside risks to price stability
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9469214081764221;turning to fiscal policies it is essential that all governments achieve the consolidation targets for 2011 that they have announced
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Positive;0.6889593601226807;moreover the announcement of fully specified consolidation measures for 2012 and beyond would help to convince the general public and market participants that the corrective policies will be sustained
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9902356266975403;strengthened confidence in the sustainability of public finances is key as this will reduce interest rate risk premia and improve the conditions for sound and sustainable growth
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9445525407791138;at the same time it is crucial that substantial and farreaching structural reforms be urgently implemented in the euro area to strengthen its growth potential competitiveness and flexibility
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Positive;0.7117211818695068;in the case of product markets policies that enhance competition and innovation should in particular be further pursued to speed up restructuring and to facilitate advances in productivity
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9241655468940735;on the labour market the priority must be to enhance wage flexibility and incentives to work and to remove labour market rigidities
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9862545728683472;finally the governing council is of the view that the package of six legislative proposals on economic governance adopted by the european council at its summit on 2425 march 2011 goes some way to improving economic and budgetary surveillance in the euro area
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Negative;0.5960338711738586;however in our view the proposals fall short of the necessary quantum leap in the surveillance of the euro area which is needed to ensure the smooth functioning of economic and monetary union
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Positive;0.5580464005470276;therefore the governing council in line with the ecbs opinion of 17 february 2011 on these proposals urges the ecofin council the european parliament and the commission to agree in the context of their trialogue on more stringent requirements more automaticity in the procedures and a clearer focus on the most vulnerable countries with losses in competitiveness
2011-04-07;2011;April;REPORT;Positive;0.4971313178539276;all this would help to ensure that the new framework is effective in the long run
