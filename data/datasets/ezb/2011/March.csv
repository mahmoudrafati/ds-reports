2011-03-03;2011;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.935492992401123;let me now explain our assessment in greater detail starting with the economic analysis
2011-03-03;2011;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9915421009063721;following the 03 quarteronquarter increase in euro area real gdp in both the third and the fourth quarter of 2010 recent statistical releases and surveybased evidence continue to confirm the positive underlying momentum of economic activity in the euro area at the beginning of 2011 looking ahead euro area exports should continue to be supported by the ongoing recovery in the world economy
2011-03-03;2011;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9913097620010376;at the same time taking into account the relatively high level of business confidence in the euro area private sector domestic demand should increasingly contribute to growth benefiting from the very accommodative monetary policy stance and the measures adopted to improve the functioning of the financial system
2011-03-03;2011;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9897029995918274;however the recovery in activity is expected to be dampened somewhat by the process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors
2011-03-03;2011;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9662653803825378;this assessment is also reflected in the march 2011 ecb staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area which foresee annual real gdp growth in a range between 13 and 21 in 2011 and between 08 and 28 in 2012 compared with the december 2010 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections the lower ends of these ranges have been shifted upwards reflecting better prospects for the global economy  and thus for euro area exports  as well as for domestic demand
2011-03-03;2011;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9871314167976379;the march 2011 ecb staff projections are broadly in line with forecasts by international organisations
2011-03-03;2011;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.6714500784873962;in the governing councils assessment the risks to this economic outlook are broadly balanced in a context of elevated uncertainty
2011-03-03;2011;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9629034399986267;on the one hand global trade may continue to grow more rapidly than expected thereby supporting euro area exports
2011-03-03;2011;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9921438694000244;moreover strong business confidence could provide more support to domestic economic activity in the euro area than is currently expected
2011-03-03;2011;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9853031635284424;on the other hand downside risks relate to the ongoing tensions in some segments of the financial markets and their potential spillover to the euro area real economy
2011-03-03;2011;March;REPORT;Negative;0.982192873954773;downside risks also relate to further increases in commodity prices in particular in view of renewed geopolitical tensions and to protectionist pressures and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances
2011-03-03;2011;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9910610318183899;with regard to price developments euro area annual hicp inflation was 24 in february 2011 according to eurostats flash estimate after 23 in january
2011-03-03;2011;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.5413637161254883;the increase in inflation rates in early 2011 largely reflects higher commodity prices
2011-03-03;2011;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9482240080833435;pressure stemming from the sharp increases in energy and food prices is also discernible in the earlier stages of the production process
2011-03-03;2011;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.7337566018104553;it is paramount that the rise in hicp inflation does not lead to secondround effects and thereby give rise to broadbased inflationary pressures over the medium term
2011-03-03;2011;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9930874705314636;inflation expectations over the medium to longer term must remain firmly anchored in line with the governing councils aim of maintaining inflation rates below but close to 2 over the medium term
2011-03-03;2011;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9909716844558716;the march 2011 ecb staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area foresee annual hicp inflation in a range between 20 and 26 for 2011 and between 10 and 24 for 2012 in comparison with the december 2010 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections the ranges for hicp inflation have been shifted upwards
2011-03-03;2011;March;REPORT;Negative;0.8075818419456482;this is mainly due to the considerable rise in energy and food prices
2011-03-03;2011;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.971080482006073;it should be stressed that the projections are based on commodity price futures as of midfebruary 2011 and therefore do not take into account the most recent oil price increases
2011-03-03;2011;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8296588659286499;moreover it needs to be emphasised that the projections assume continued moderate domestic wage and pricesetting behaviour
2011-03-03;2011;March;REPORT;Negative;0.8716775178909302;risks to the mediumterm outlook for price developments are on the upside
2011-03-03;2011;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8157005906105042;they relate in particular to higher than assumed increases in energy and nonenergy commodity prices
2011-03-03;2011;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.5724266767501831;furthermore increases in indirect taxes and administered prices may be greater than currently assumed owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years
2011-03-03;2011;March;REPORT;Positive;0.8364637494087219;finally risks also relate to stronger than expected domestic price pressures in the context of the ongoing recovery in activity
2011-03-03;2011;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9666658043861389;price and wage setters behaviour should not lead to broadly based secondround effects stemming from higher commodity prices

2011-03-03;2011;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.7084875702857971;looking beyond the movements in individual months and the effects of special factors trends in broad money and loan growth confirm the assessment that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is still moderate and that inflationary pressures over the medium to longer term should remain contained
2011-03-03;2011;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9908904433250427;at the same time the low level of money and credit growth has thus far led to only a partial unwinding of the large amounts of monetary liquidity accumulated in the economy prior to the period of financial tensions
2011-03-03;2011;March;REPORT;Positive;0.989028811454773;this liquidity may facilitate the accommodation of price pressures currently emerging in commodity markets as a result of strong economic growth and ample liquidity at the global level
2011-03-03;2011;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9886133670806885;looking at m3 components annual m1 growth moderated further to stand at 32 in january 2011 reflecting the prevailing low remuneration of overnight deposits
2011-03-03;2011;March;REPORT;Negative;0.7369590997695923;at the same time the yield curve steepened somewhat further at the start of the year implying that the attractiveness of shortterm instruments included in m3 continues to decline compared with more highly remunerated longerterm instruments outside m3
2011-03-03;2011;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9903449416160583;on the counterpart side the rise in the annual growth rate of bank loans to the private sector in january was due to stronger lending to both households and nonfinancial corporations

2011-03-03;2011;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9724864959716797;it is important that banks continue to expand the provision of credit to the private sector in an environment of increasing demand
2011-03-03;2011;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8978808522224426;to address this challenge where necessary it is essential for banks to retain earnings to turn to the market to strengthen further their capital bases or to take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation
2011-03-03;2011;March;REPORT;Negative;0.8479670286178589;in particular banks that currently have limited access to market financing urgently need to increase their capital and their efficiency
