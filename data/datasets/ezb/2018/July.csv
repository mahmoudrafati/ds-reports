2018-07-12;2018;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9890556335449219;in this context it was underlined that the monetary policy stance remained very supportive of continued economic expansion and a gradual increase in inflation in the euro area
2018-07-12;2018;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.7914760112762451;on the basis of this assessment members expressed unanimous support for the monetary policy proposal put forward by mr praet in his introduction

2018-07-12;2018;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.986876368522644;at the same time it was also widely agreed that monetary policy accommodation had to remain ample which called for confirming the forward guidance on the reinvestment of the principal payments from maturing securities for an extended period of time while providing greater clarity on the expected future course of policy interest rates by enhancing the forward guidance on rates through explicit datebased and statecontingent elements
2018-07-12;2018;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9931396842002869;this entailed the expectation that policy rates would remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019 and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure that the evolution of inflation remained aligned with the governing councils current expectations of a sustained adjustment path
2018-07-12;2018;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.994644045829773;the anticipation of the end of the net purchases by the yearend was seen to be fully consistent with previous communication by the governing council which had made the horizon of the net asset purchases conditional on the extent of progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation
2018-07-12;2018;July;REPORT;Positive;0.7098613381385803;accordingly with the substantial progress achieved as also reflected in the inflation outlook contained in the recent eurosystem staff projections announcing the end of net purchases was widely regarded as following the gradual and predictable pattern of past recalibrations of the monetary policy stance including the removal of the app easing bias and the previous gradual reductions in the monthly pace of net asset purchases
2018-07-12;2018;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9826322793960571;furthermore given prevailing uncertainty it was considered prudent to leave the end of net asset purchases still conditional on incoming data confirming the mediumterm inflation outlook and to highlight the governing councils commitment to providing sufficient monetary stimulus for as long as necessary

2018-07-12;2018;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9869233965873718;on this basis members unanimously agreed with the proposal made by mr praet in his introduction to reconfirm the forward guidance on the governing councils reinvestment policy while enhancing the forward guidance on policy interest rates
2018-07-12;2018;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9801065921783447;on reinvestment the governing council reiterated its intention to maintain its policy of reinvesting the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the app for an extended period of time after the end of the net asset purchases and in any case for as long as necessary
2018-07-12;2018;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9159864783287048;it was highlighted that the future reinvestments of the principal payments from maturing securities would imply a continued sizable presence of the eurosystem in euro area securities markets thereby contributing significantly to favourable liquidity conditions and the overall accommodative monetary policy stance
2018-07-12;2018;July;REPORT;Positive;0.8012319207191467;the enhanced forward guidance on policy rates via explicit datebased and statecontingent elements was seen to provide greater clarity on the future path of policy interest rates thereby anchoring policy rate expectations more firmly to support the financial conditions underpinning a continued convergence of inflation towards the governing councils inflation aim
2018-07-12;2018;July;REPORT;Positive;0.8051629066467285;the strengthening of the forward guidance on the ecbs policy rates was viewed as underlining their pivotal role as the tool of choice for adjusting the monetary policy stance in the future
2018-07-12;2018;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9928959012031555;in this regard reference was made to the developments in policy rate expectations over recent months which already indicated the markets perception of the predominant role of the policy rates as the instrument for steering and communicating the monetary policy stance
2018-07-12;2018;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9413360357284546;overall the proposed formulation indicating the governing councils expectation that policy rates would be kept at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019 and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure that the evolution of inflation remained aligned with a sustained adjustment path was seen to strike a good balance between providing sufficiently precise guidance and maintaining adequate flexibility
2018-07-12;2018;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9922896027565002;the proposed statecontingent component of the forward guidance on policy rates was widely seen as underlining the gradual and datadependent approach to policy normalisation
2018-07-12;2018;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9150927066802979;in this regard explicitly linking a first policy rate rise to inflation evolving along a sustained adjustment path was seen as consistent with the ecbs forwardlooking and mediumtermoriented monetary policy strategy and would underscore the credibility of the governing councils commitment to its price stability objective
2018-07-12;2018;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9837362170219421;against this background members agreed with the communication proposals made by mr praet in his introduction
2018-07-12;2018;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9706832766532898;it needed to be emphasised that while the incoming data had been somewhat weaker than previously expected the fundamentals remained in place for the mediumterm growth outlook to remain solid and broadbased as also embodied in the june 2018 eurosystem staff projections
2018-07-12;2018;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9731941819190979;accordingly it needed to be highlighted that the underlying strength of the euro area expansion together with rising price pressures wellanchored inflation expectations and the continuing ample degree of monetary accommodation provided grounds for confidence in the sustained convergence of inflation

2018-07-12;2018;July;REPORT;Negative;0.5900644063949585;this suggested a continued need for patience prudence and persistence in monetary policy for inflation pressures to build up and for the governing council to deliver on its commitment to secure a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels below but close to 2 over the medium term
2018-07-12;2018;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9930152893066406;the anticipated windingdown of app net purchases subject to incoming data confirming the governing councils mediumterm inflation outlook was seen to be fully in line with the forwardlooking and probabilistic nature of the assessment of a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation and the corresponding need for monetary policy to preserve optionality and react flexibly to major deviations from the envisaged inflation convergence
2018-07-12;2018;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8376930356025696;more broadly it needed to be reiterated that significant monetary policy stimulus was still needed for a continued and sustained adjustment in the path of inflation

2018-07-12;2018;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9701275825500488;finally in the light of prevailing uncertainties that could put a sustained convergence of inflation at risk it was widely considered prudent to stress the governing councils continued readiness to adjust all of its instruments as appropriate to ensure that inflation continued to move towards the governing councils aim in a sustained manner
