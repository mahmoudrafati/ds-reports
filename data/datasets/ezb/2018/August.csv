2018-08-23;2018;August;REPORT;Positive;0.9930960536003113;looking at the main demand components support for the mediumterm growth outlook continued to come from strong consumption fundamentals notably ongoing employment growth

2018-08-23;2018;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9930156469345093;in this context the point was made that the weaker momentum in export growth and the associated losses in market shares might in part also reflect the past appreciation of the euro in conjunction with other determinants of export demand such as global growth
2018-08-23;2018;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9306594729423523;furthermore a remark was made that supply factors might also be contributing to a structural levellingoff of economic growth with a number of surveys pointing to labour market tightness becoming progressively more widespread across sectors and countries

2018-08-23;2018;August;REPORT;Positive;0.9831663370132446;overall m3 growth continued to be supported by the impact of the ecbs monetary policy measures and by the low opportunity cost of holding the most liquid deposits

2018-08-23;2018;August;REPORT;Negative;0.8745540380477905;nevertheless significant monetary policy stimulus was considered to be still needed to support the further buildup of domestic price pressures and headline inflation over the medium term
