2018-11-22;2018;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9676979780197144;at the same time the point was made that wage indexation mechanisms had become significantly less important since the financial crisis in a number of countries
2018-11-22;2018;November;REPORT;Negative;0.5888882279396057;this suggested that secondround effects might now be less relevant than in the past
2018-11-22;2018;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9792813062667847;as regards developments in oil markets it was argued that the likely response of oil supply in the current circumstances to an increase in demand was highly uncertain
2018-11-22;2018;November;REPORT;Negative;0.8733983635902405;furthermore it was argued that there had been a fundamental break in oil price dynamics with the role of shale oil affecting the responsiveness of supply which was not the case in the first decade of monetary union and in the preceding period
2018-11-22;2018;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9189992547035217;as a consequence oil price movements were volatile but not particularly persistent
2018-11-22;2018;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9715344309806824;it was highlighted that while higher oil prices might constitute a downward risk for growth via the adverse termsoftrade effect on consumption a positive impact on inflation was to be expected including from the secondround effects of past increases in oil prices
2018-11-22;2018;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9538367390632629;members underlined that the transmission of higher wages to consumer price inflation was subject to lags
2018-11-22;2018;November;REPORT;Negative;0.6699298024177551;questions were raised in particular about the behaviour of profit margins and markups
2018-11-22;2018;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8467384576797485;it was noted that firms had so far accommodated higher wages by reducing markups
2018-11-22;2018;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9626765251159668;it was also argued that markups could not be squeezed indefinitely
2018-11-22;2018;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9809282422065735;members also referred to the possible impact of trade tensions on the outlook for inflation
2018-11-22;2018;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9778516292572021;it was considered that the overall impact was ambiguous and would depend on the balance of demand and supply effects
2018-11-22;2018;November;REPORT;Positive;0.6297970414161682;as regards developments in inflation expectations members noted that longerterm market and surveybased measures appeared to be reasonably well anchored
2018-11-22;2018;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9907936453819275;according to the latest ecb survey of professional forecasters spf longerterm inflation expectations were unchanged at 19 while the fiveyear forward inflationlinked swap rate five years ahead had also remained stable at around 17
2018-11-22;2018;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9847127199172974;with regard to the monetary analysis members concurred with the assessment presented by mr praet in his introduction
2018-11-22;2018;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.6748898029327393;broad money m3 growth had remained broadly stable and was increasingly supported by bank credit creation
2018-11-22;2018;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9766753315925598;the narrow monetary aggregate m1 remained the main contributor to broad money growth
2018-11-22;2018;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9269148111343384;it was noted that the growth of mfi loans to the private sector had strengthened further continuing the upward trend observed since the beginning of 2014 in the euro area the growth of loans to nfcs had increased further in september while the growth of loans to households had remained unchanged at robust levels supported by the ongoing economic expansion and very favourable credit conditions
2018-11-22;2018;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9920850396156311;it was seen as encouraging that the latest bank lending survey continued to indicate increasing demand across all loan categories and positive readings on bank lending conditions for loans to enterprises and to households for house purchase
2018-11-22;2018;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.6204822063446045;in this context the remark was made that the maturity of some of the targeted longerterm refinancing operations would fall below one year in the course of the next year which could impact the evolution of excess liquidity and might affect banks liquidity position
2018-11-22;2018;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9900614023208618;it was also argued that from a prudential perspective some caution was warranted as regards the potential implications of very easy credit conditions and low lending rates for banks capacity to appropriately price and account for credit risk
2018-11-22;2018;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9569107890129089;reference was made to the recent increase in sovereign bond spreads in one euro area country where it was noted that lending rates for firms and households had increased and marketbased financing costs for nfcs had risen somewhat more markedly in that economy
2018-11-22;2018;November;REPORT;Negative;0.8553853631019592;some tightening in lending conditions was also visible for that economy in the recent results of the bank lending survey with in particular the terms and conditions on new loans to the private sector having tightened moderately
2018-11-22;2018;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9909365773200989;monetary policy stance and policy considerations with regard to the monetary policy stance members generally shared the assessment provided by mr praet in his introduction
2018-11-22;2018;November;REPORT;Positive;0.8786062002182007;the incoming data while somewhat weaker than expected remained overall consistent with an ongoing broadbased expansion of the euro area economy and gradually rising inflation pressures
2018-11-22;2018;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9878829121589661;the underlying strength of the euro area economy and increased evidence of building wage pressures continued to support confidence that the sustained convergence of inflation to the governing councils aim would proceed and be maintained even after a gradual windingdown of net asset purchases
2018-11-22;2018;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9922129511833191;at the same time uncertainties relating to rising protectionism vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility remained prominent
2018-11-22;2018;November;REPORT;Negative;0.7919320464134216;significant monetary policy stimulus was still needed to support the further buildup of domestic price pressures and headline inflation developments over the medium term
2018-11-22;2018;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.972334623336792;this support would continue to be provided by the net asset purchases until the end of the year by the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the associated reinvestments and by the enhanced forward guidance on the key ecb interest rates
2018-11-22;2018;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9108180403709412;there was broad agreement that borrowing conditions for the real economy remained highly supportive of a continued economic expansion and a gradual increase in inflation pressures in the euro area although financial conditions had tightened somewhat overall since the governing councils previous monetary policy meeting mainly due to declining share prices
2018-11-22;2018;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8540874719619751;the euro had depreciated modestly against the us dollar and in nominal effective terms while euro area riskfree interest rates had increased somewhat
2018-11-22;2018;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9913325905799866;rising interest rates and the related decline in us stock market valuations had also weighed on equity prices in the euro area with bank stocks particularly affected
2018-11-22;2018;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9448028802871704;in this context it was noted that equity valuations still generally remained at high levels notably for the united states as evidenced for example by the level of cyclically adjusted pricetoearnings ratios
2018-11-22;2018;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.6873805522918701;it was observed that sovereign bond spreads in one large euro area country had increased
2018-11-22;2018;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9484859704971313;contagion to other financial market segments and other sovereign bond markets had so far remained limited
2018-11-22;2018;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8015240430831909;against this background members widely agreed that patience prudence and persistence with regard to monetary policy remained warranted as set out in the proposals made by mr praet in his introduction
2018-11-22;2018;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9919630289077759;maintaining the prevailing monetary policy stance in line with the decisions taken at previous meetings was seen to be consistent with the governing councils datadriven approach to monetary policy oriented towards the medium term
2018-11-22;2018;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9887529611587524;continuity and steadiness with respect to monetary policy were particularly warranted in an environment that was still subject to a number of uncertainties and fragilities
2018-11-22;2018;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9907668828964233;accordingly the governing council would reiterate its anticipation that  subject to incoming data confirming the ecbs mediumterm inflation outlook  net asset purchases would be discontinued at the end of december 2018 and would reassert all elements of forward guidance pertaining to the ecbs key interest rates and reinvestments under the asset purchase programme app
2018-11-22;2018;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9791364669799805;there was broad agreement among members that the overall monetary policy stance remained highly expansionary and would remain so even after the net asset purchases had ended
2018-11-22;2018;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9618435502052307;while the monthly amount of net purchases had been reduced it was seen as important to highlight that the ecbs balance sheet continued to grow and was still adding monetary policy stimulus although at a slower pace
2018-11-22;2018;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.846246063709259;in this context it was also stressed that even after the net purchases had ceased ample monetary policy accommodation would remain in place notably owing to the stock of assets on the ecbs balance sheet and the associated reinvestments as well as to the forward guidance on interest rates
2018-11-22;2018;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9092931151390076;the very high degree of monetary stimulus was also seen to be reflected in various measures of the monetary stance such as real interest rates which at the short end still stood at exceptionally low levels
2018-11-22;2018;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9860013723373413;on communication members widely concurred with the elements proposed by mr praet in his introduction
2018-11-22;2018;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9884474873542786;in particular it was seen as appropriate to maintain a steady hand in communication also in the light of prevailing uncertainties and fully in line with the previous decisions and communication adopted by the governing council
2018-11-22;2018;November;REPORT;Positive;0.8497520089149475;accordingly it needed to be emphasised that the incoming data while somewhat weaker than expected remained overall consistent with an ongoing broadbased expansion of the euro area economy and gradually rising inflation pressures
2018-11-22;2018;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9231645464897156;it was likewise important to stress that risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook could still be assessed as broadly balanced in line with earlier assessments but that the risks relating to protectionism vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility remained prominent
2018-11-22;2018;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9933096170425415;overall it was important to highlight that conditions remained in place for inflation to move sustainably towards the governing councils mediumterm inflation aim
2018-11-22;2018;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9446907043457031;in particular it needed to be stressed that the underlying strength of the euro area economy supported by high levels of capacity utilisation and a progressive tightening of labour markets with the associated rise in wages continued to support the governing councils confidence that the convergence of inflation to levels below but close to 2 over the medium term would continue in the period ahead and would be maintained after a gradual windingdown of the net asset purchases
2018-11-22;2018;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9694240689277649;in the light of still prevailing uncertainties and only gradually rising underlying inflation there was also broad agreement among the members that it was essential to remain prudent patient and persistent with regard to monetary policy
2018-11-22;2018;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.968679666519165;accordingly it was necessary to reiterate that significant monetary policy stimulus was still needed for a continued and durable convergence of inflation
2018-11-22;2018;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9914959669113159;at the same time it had to be emphasised that monetary policy remained on a steady track in line with current market expectations and in full consistency with decisions taken at previous governing council meetings
2018-11-22;2018;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.6515386700630188;in this context it needed to be recalled that even after the net purchases came to a close monetary policy would remain highly accommodative
2018-11-22;2018;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.7022197842597961;an ample degree of monetary accommodation would continue to be provided by the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the associated reinvestments and by the governing councils enhanced forward guidance
2018-11-22;2018;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9897246360778809;moreover it was widely considered prudent to restate the governing councils readiness to adjust all of its instruments as appropriate to ensure that inflation continued to move towards the governing councils inflation aim in a sustained manner
2018-11-22;2018;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9935344457626343;monetary policy decisions and communication taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members on a proposal from the president the governing council decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility would remain unchanged at 000 025 and 040 respectively
2018-11-22;2018;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9941270351409912;the governing council would continue to make net purchases under the app at the new monthly pace of 15 billion until the end of december 2018 it anticipated that subject to incoming data confirming the mediumterm inflation outlook net purchases would then end
2018-11-22;2018;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9610758423805237;the governing council intended to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the app for an extended period of time after the end of the net asset purchases and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation
