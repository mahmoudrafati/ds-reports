2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9056662917137146;it was flagged that downside risks also stemmed from increasing leverage in some sectors in a few euro area countries and more significantly in other parts of the world

2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9903439283370972;it was emphasised that the stronger than expected economic expansion further strengthened the case for using the present window of opportunity to decisively address remaining fiscal and structural weaknesses across euro area countries

2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9863153100013733;with regard to price developments members broadly shared the assessment provided by mr praet in his introduction
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9940842986106873;annual euro area hicp inflation had been 15 in november 2017 up from 14 in october while measures of underlying inflation had retreated slightly
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.7912910580635071;in the near term headline inflation was expected to decrease somewhat mainly owing to base effects in energy prices
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.7153749465942383;further ahead the economic expansion and the associated significant absorption of economic slack were expected to contribute to a gradual convergence of inflation to levels below but close to 2 over the medium term
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9865322709083557;this was broadly reflected in the december 2017 eurosystem staff projections
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.6893261671066284;during the discussion on recent developments in inflation it was highlighted that while headline inflation had increased somewhat measures of underlying inflation such as hicp inflation excluding food and energy had been affected adversely by recent negative data surprises in particular in services prices
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9755920767784119;this in turn was expected to have a downward impact on the nearterm outlook for underlying inflation
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9147136211395264;it was remarked that some of these surprises appeared to be of a temporary nature reflecting oneoff factors and should hence not affect the governing councils confidence in the gradual return of inflation towards the ecbs inflation aim over the medium term
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9561951160430908;it was also highlighted that staff projected hicp inflation excluding food and energy to reach 18 in 2020 a level significantly above the precrisis average for the euro area
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9935053586959839;however it was also pointed out that recent downward surprises implied a continued gap between headline and underlying inflation for some time to come which was seen as a matter of concern
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9633424878120422;caution was expressed regarding the projected pickup in underlying inflation over the projection horizon in particular with respect to the assumed rebound in wage dynamics which to date had remained subdued compared with historical regularities
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9500689506530762;however the latest data for the third quarter of 2017 as well as an upward revision to the data for the second quarter of 2017 provided initial signs of an uptick in wage pressures
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9726574420928955;some comfort could be drawn from the fact that these somewhat stronger wage dynamics were being observed across a number of countries
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9945523142814636;as regards inflation expectations surveybased measures had remained broadly unchanged since the previous monetary policy meeting while marketbased measures had increased slightly
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9886122345924377;overall these developments suggested that inflation expectations remained broadly anchored
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.6579818725585938;the risk of an unanchoring of inflation expectations was briefly discussed
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9744675159454346;some comments were made that this was unlikely as inflation expectations had remained stable and the risk of a deflationary scenario had practically disappeared
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9873363375663757;at the same time it was cautioned that inflation expectations based on the fiveyear and tenyear spot inflationlinked swap rates remained low and that expectations could become unanchored in an environment of prolonged low inflation to the extent that price expectations were adaptive and responded to actual inflation
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.7183497548103333;several observations were made on the apparent disconnect between developments in the real economy and price dynamics
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Negative;0.6035970449447632;this disconnect appeared to have persisted or even increased over recent months as growth had repeatedly been stronger than expected in the euro area and inflation dynamics had remained largely unchanged or surprised on the downside
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9379868507385254;this phenomenon was not limited to the euro area since low inflation had been observed across many advanced economies in spite of strong global growth
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9919831156730652;confidence was widely expressed that ultimately the further absorption of slack should lead to upward wage and price pressures
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.8724393248558044;the latest staff projections foresaw that the output gap would close in the near future earlier than previously projected
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Negative;0.993812084197998;as economic activity was expected to grow consistently above potential over the projection horizon it was seen as very likely that capacity constraints would become increasingly binding and lead to higher price pressures
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Positive;0.990755021572113;it was also remarked that the positive feedback loop between economic growth and price increases could once more firmly established operate more rapidly than expected
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Negative;0.8701653480529785;however as discussed in earlier meetings it was also emphasised that output gap measures had to be viewed with caution
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9751656651496887;equilibrium concepts  such as potential output or the nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment  were subject to considerable measurement uncertainty
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9207177758216858;the degree of remaining spare capacity could be considerably larger than implied by traditional measures of slack
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.7689985036849976;it was therefore seen as important to continue examining wider measures taking into account for instance involuntary parttime or discouraged workers which pointed to lower capacity utilisation than standard output gap or unemployment measures
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9930626749992371;furthermore it was mentioned that technological changes and globalisation could have diminished the pricing power of firms on a more lasting basis and also might have reduced the sensitivity of prices to economic activity
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.7492274045944214;it was suggested that the share of the hicp basket that reacted to the output gap as seen in supercore indicators of underlying inflation might be shrinking
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9882176518440247;with regard to the mediumterm outlook for prices it was observed that staff projected headline inflation to be 17 in 2020 it was also recalled that the level of inflation was conditional on the technical assumptions underlying the projection exercise
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9932987689971924;in particular the assumption for oil prices reflected an upwardly revised but declining path for futures prices
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9842137098312378;if constant prices were to be assumed instead headline inflation would be somewhat higher in 2020 overall it was however underlined that caution remained warranted and that the projected upward path for inflation was subject to considerable uncertainty with as yet insufficient signs of selfsustaining upward pressures in underlying inflation
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9912374019622803;all in all members considered that the stronger than expected economic expansion underpinned by favourable financing conditions and supported by the ecbs monetary policy increased the level of confidence in a sustained return of inflation towards the governing councils aim
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9543921947479248;as underlying inflation was still subdued it was however felt that patience and persistence remained essential for the continued absorption of economic slack to exert pressure on prices
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9847127199172974;with regard to the monetary analysis members concurred with the assessment presented by mr praet in his introduction
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9889912605285645;broad money m3 had continued to expand at a robust pace
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.8529770374298096;this reflected the impact of the ecbs monetary policy measures and the low opportunity cost of holding the most liquid components
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9741247296333313;accordingly the narrow monetary aggregate m1 continued to be the main contributor to broad money growth

2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Positive;0.8900917172431946;the expansion in credit continued to be supported by very favourable borrowing costs for firms and households across euro area countries
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9896857142448425;the survey on the access to finance of enterprises for the period aprilseptember 2017 pointed to further improvements in the financial situation of firms and better availability of external finance including for smes
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9940510392189026;it was remarked that loan growth in the euro areas second largest economy had seen rather buoyant expansion and that increasing leverage in conjunction with increased merger and acquisition and leveraged buyout activity raised concerns from a financial stability perspective
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.7215240001678467;in addition the view was expressed that the significant compression of market financing costs across the board needed to be monitored closely
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9853754043579102;it was however emphasised that potential financial stability risks had to be addressed through adequate macroprudential measures
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9912790656089783;monetary policy stance and policy considerations with regard to the monetary policy stance members widely shared the assessment provided by mr praet in his introduction that the latest data and information including the new eurosystem staff projections pointed to a strong pace of economic expansion and a significant improvement in the growth outlook
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9920076131820679;the strong cyclical momentum and the associated significant reduction of economic slack provided increasing confidence that inflation would converge to the governing councils aim
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9504123330116272;at the same time underlying price pressures remained muted overall and had yet to show convincing signs of a sustained upward trend
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Positive;0.7806793451309204;overall the assessment vindicated the monetary policy decisions taken at the october meeting and confirmed the continued need for an ample degree of monetary accommodation to ensure a sustained adjustment of inflation towards the governing councils aim
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9861142635345459;members expressed satisfaction with the way the governing councils rationale for the recalibration of the app and the guidance provided in its communication had been understood
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Positive;0.5972570776939392;these decisions had succeeded in preserving the very favourable financing conditions that were necessary to secure a sustained convergence of inflation rates towards levels below but close to 2 over the medium term
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9026228785514832;if anything overall financial conditions had eased slightly since the october meeting and in particular borrowing conditions for firms and households had remained very favourable
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Positive;0.974877655506134;in this context it was noted that in the light of the improving macroeconomic environment the favourable financial conditions were increasingly gaining traction supporting investment spending and credit creation
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.509346067905426;the argument was put forward that as the economy expanded further an unchanged monetary policy setting would become increasingly expansionary also in view of the stimulus arising from the still increasing stock of assets on the eurosystems balance sheet
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.8289933204650879;a remark was made that a gap appeared to be emerging between favourable economic conditions and a policy stance that remained in a crisis configuration
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9696216583251953;however it was also recalled that the favourable economic and financial conditions were still dependent on an ample degree of monetary accommodation and that the mediumterm outlook for prices was key to determining the appropriate monetary policy stance
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.6200688481330872;overall there was broad agreement among members that the current monetary policy stance remained appropriate with recent developments  while more positive than previously expected  generally seen to vindicate the decisions taken by the governing council at its meeting in late october
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9913949370384216;it was widely emphasised that confidence in the convergence of inflation towards the governing councils aim had clearly strengthened since the previous meeting as economic growth indicators had continued to be better than expected and the new eurosystem staff projections embodied a material improvement in the growth outlook
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9916663765907288;comfort was also drawn from the inflation path reflected in the projections with inflation approaching levels in line with the governing councils aim towards the end of the projection horizon
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Negative;0.6912534236907959;at the same time while the significant absorption of economic slack was expected to ultimately generate the price pressures needed for inflation to move towards the governing councils aim this convergence was still subject to uncertainties surrounding for example the interpretation of the recent unexpected decline in measures of underlying inflation the measurement of economic slack and the formation of inflation expectations after a prolonged period of low inflation
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.8623241186141968;importantly convergence remained contingent on continued support provided by the full range of the ecbs monetary policy measures currently in place
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9208737015724182;against this background members widely agreed that the governing council needed to remain patient and persistent with its monetary policy maintaining the current monetary policy stance while emphasising the increased confidence in the achievement of its mediumterm inflation aim
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9878656268119812;this implied confirming all the monetary policy decisions taken at the meeting in late october regarding the key ecb interest rates the net asset purchases and reinvestments as well as the forward guidance with respect to those measures
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9091976284980774;in this regard the increased easing impact from the stock of acquired assets and from the governing councils reinvestment policy was highlighted

2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Negative;0.7774625420570374;at the same time these findings showed only limited evidence of distortions in market functioning or of a crowding out of bank lending which had instead remained on an upward path including for smes
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9869770407676697;moreover while risk premia in corporate bond markets had been compressed significantly this applied both to corporate bonds eligible for purchase under the programme and to ineligible bonds which suggested that the impact of the cspp had been marketneutral and portfolio rebalancing had been effective across market segments
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Positive;0.8805312514305115;as regards communication agreement was generally expressed with the proposals made by mr praet suggesting broad continuity in the governing councils communication at the present stage while emphasising the greater confidence in the inflation outlook
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.975470244884491;while a few members recalled their reservations concerning some elements of the decisions taken at the october monetary policy meeting the merits of a steady hand in communication were widely acknowledged
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9434982538223267;this implied confirming the october decisions and the associated communication which had been well understood by market participants
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9213446378707886;changes in communication were generally seen to be premature at this juncture with caution still warranted

2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Negative;0.7371519207954407;at the same time it was argued that communication needed to evolve gradually in step with improving economic data and a further easing of financial conditions was not regarded as warranted
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9802890419960022;from this perspective it was important for the forward guidance to be updated in line with evolving data with a view to avoiding more abrupt or disorderly adjustments at a later stage
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9900075197219849;it should be highlighted that the stronger than expected expansion of the euro area economy had further reduced the likelihood of adverse economic outcomes and hence had bolstered the governing councils confidence in the eventual attainment of its inflation aim
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9461649060249329;more generally the governing councils emphasis on data dependency in its approach to forward guidance was recalled
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9859619736671448;in this context it had to be stressed that the improved economic environment was in part related to the ecbs monetary policy measures which continued to pass through to the real economy
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.7057631611824036;overall it was seen as important to reiterate the october policy decisions to underline the governing councils commitment to its price stability objective and to reaffirm that an ample degree of monetary stimulus remained necessary for inflation to converge towards the governing councils aim
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9890415072441101;it was again underlined that this stimulus was provided by the governing councils entire policy package notably the additional net asset purchases decided in october by the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the forthcoming reinvestments and by the forward guidance on key interest rates
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9635613560676575;looking ahead the view was widely shared among members that the governing councils communication would need to evolve gradually without a change in sequencing if the economy continued to expand and inflation converged further towards the governing councils aim
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9872389435768127;the language pertaining to various dimensions of the monetary policy stance and forward guidance could be revisited early in the coming year
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9450472593307495;in particular as progress was made towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation the relative importance of the forward guidance on policy rates would increase as suggested by mr praet in his introduction
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9901478886604309;from this perspective the governing councils forward guidance framework would evolve naturally in line with the established sequencing between the app and interest rate guidance
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9849284291267395;it was suggested that the governing councils communication should be adjusted gradually over time to avoid sudden and unwarranted movements in financial conditions
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9882014393806458;in this regard it was also seen as warranted to reflect on how to transition gradually from the present conditionality focused on app net purchases to a broader concept of forward guidance comprising various dimensions of the monetary policy stance
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.972873330116272;in any event it was recalled that even when the net purchases ceased the monetary policy stance would remain highly accommodative via the accumulated stock of acquired assets future reinvestments and the forward guidance on policy rates which would continue to accompany the economic cycle and the development of inflation along a sustained adjustment path
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9935344457626343;monetary policy decisions and communication taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members on a proposal from the president the governing council decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility would remain unchanged at 000 025 and 040 respectively
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9708134531974792;the governing council continued to expect the key ecb interest rates to remain at their present levels for an extended period of time and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9915620684623718;regarding nonstandard monetary policy measures the governing council confirmed that purchases under the app would continue at the current monthly pace of 60 billion until the end of december 2017 and that from january 2018 it intended to continue to make net asset purchases at a monthly pace of 30 billion until the end of september 2018 or beyond if necessary and in any case until the governing council saw a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9481282234191895;if the outlook became less favourable or if financial conditions became inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation the governing council stood ready to increase the app in terms of size andor duration
2018-01-11;2018;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9852264523506165;the eurosystem would reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the app for an extended period of time after the end of its net asset purchases and in any case for as long as necessary
