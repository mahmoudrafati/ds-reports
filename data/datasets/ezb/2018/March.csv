2018-03-22;2018;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.9631214737892152;this box provides an overview of the various aspects that are relevant in this regard
2018-03-22;2018;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.8195268511772156;127 forces relating to population ageing and pension reforms are a slowmoving driver of the equilibrium real interest rate a variable that is important when judging the monetary policy stance for any given inflation objective
2018-03-22;2018;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Negative;0.9784711003303528;128 as various studies have pointed out past and projected future demographic forces place slowmoving downward pressure on the euro areas equilibrium real interest rate in line with the developments observed in many other jurisdictions
2018-03-22;2018;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.9921631217002868;on the basis of a smallscale new keynesian model enriched with a demographic structure kara and thadden offer modelbased longterm simulations for the euro area starting in 2008 and running until 2030 which allow likely effects to be broken down into those attributable to pure demographic forces and those related to various pension system designs
2018-03-22;2018;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Negative;0.9902352690696716;129 that study confirms that two major demographic forces namely the declining growth rate of the workingage population and increases in life expectancy are contributing independently to declines in the equilibrium real interest rate
2018-03-22;2018;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.9894272685050964;130 the first force is consistent with longterm predictions by standard growth models131 while the second operates through lifecycle effects on savings and consumption as typically addressed by olg models
2018-03-22;2018;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.9804714918136596;132 the study shows that the strength of the second force depends critically on how pension systems respond to demographic changes since pension arrangements  both existing and expected future arrangements  interact directly with lifecycle motives for savings
2018-03-22;2018;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.9720122814178468;these insights are quantified in two polar scenarios
2018-03-22;2018;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.9870972633361816;133 first the cumulative longterm effect on the equilibrium real interest rate will be most pronounced in a scenario in which the rise in the oldage dependency ratio encourages additional private savings by workers assuming an unchanged retirement age and a ceiling on the amount of taxfinanced redistribution from workers to pensioners
2018-03-22;2018;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.937969982624054;in this scenario which strengthens privately funded elements the cumulative decline in the period to 2030 totals around 110 basis points
2018-03-22;2018;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.9179694652557372;in contrast this effect would be significantly reduced in a second scenario where it was assumed that pensions would continue to be funded via a payasyougo system leading to an increase in taxfinanced redistribution from workers to pensioners
2018-03-22;2018;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Negative;0.9526629447937012;finally reducing the benefit ratio such that the ageingrelated adverse impact on debt is avoided results in gdp per capita falling only marginally less than in the reference scenario
2018-03-22;2018;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Positive;0.9898924827575684;the outlook for advanced economies is for robust expansion now reinforced by the additional fiscal impact emanating from the us tax reform and agreement on increased expenditure by the us congress
2018-03-22;2018;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Positive;0.5113559365272522;this is driven largely by stronger negative effects on consumption per capita and employment
2018-03-22;2018;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.8847668170928955;in concrete terms this means that gdp per capita declines by 36 less than in the reference scenario see table a
2018-03-22;2018;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.7939990758895874;however a move towards higher levels of mandatory funding generally entails a double burden for those generations who are continuing to contribute to the payasyougo system for existing pensioners while simultaneously having to build up their own pension savings
2018-03-22;2018;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Negative;0.9848297238349916;moreover fully funded pension schemes can pose risks to household finances in an environment of low or negative asset returns for example in the presence of low equilibrium interest rates

2018-03-22;2018;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.8993188738822937;as was stressed in previous sections these forces will influence the euro areas equilibrium real interest rate for the foreseeable future

2018-03-22;2018;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.9863472580909728;it does not however address the question of which type of reform measure is most appropriate for which euro area country given that this issue is highly countryspecific
2018-03-22;2018;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.985879123210907;the three types of pension reform under assessment involve changes to the retirement age the contribution rate and the benefit ratio
2018-03-22;2018;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.9814273715019226;in addition this exercise also considers an increase in personal income tax to compensate for the impact that ageing has on public debt
2018-03-22;2018;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.93857079744339;the results of this exercise point to considerable differences in terms of the macroeconomic effects of the three pension reforms
2018-03-22;2018;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Positive;0.6975080966949463;these simulations suggest that raising the retirement age has the potential to considerably reduce the adverse impact that ageing has on growth
2018-03-22;2018;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Negative;0.8776472806930542;126 in contrast simply increasing contribution rates or personal income taxes results in the adverse macroeconomic impact strengthening rather than weakening relative to the reference scenario
2018-03-22;2018;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Positive;0.9775879383087158;this could encourage increases in domestic savings which could also turn out to be beneficial for asset markets
2018-03-22;2018;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.8677442073822021;134 besides forces relating to ageing and pension reforms equilibrium interest rates are also affected by a wide range of other factors
2018-03-22;2018;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Negative;0.9904284477233888;the evidence documented in the literature emphasises inter alia productivitydriven aspects of secular stagnation slow balance sheet repair in the aftermath of the financial crisis and the scarcity of safe assets
2018-03-22;2018;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Negative;0.9849227666854858;there will also be additional upward pressure on public spending on pensions health care and longterm care
2018-03-22;2018;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Negative;0.9891597628593444;this will make it challenging for euro area countries to reduce their sizeable debt burdens and ensure fiscal sustainability in the long run
2018-03-22;2018;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.7903685569763184;against this background many countries implemented pension reforms following the sovereign debt crisis although the pace of reform has slowed of late
2018-03-22;2018;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.7791928648948669;further reforms in this area would seem to be essential and should not be delayed also in view of political economy considerations
2018-03-22;2018;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.9826810956001282;while pension reforms will help to contain the fiscal impact of population ageing their precise macroeconomic implications may vary considerably depending on the specific nature of those reform measures
2018-03-22;2018;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Negative;0.832884669303894;in particular increasing the retirement age can be expected to reduce the adverse macroeconomic effects of ageing thanks to a favourable impact on the labour supply and domestic consumption
2018-03-22;2018;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.958190619945526;in contrast reducing the benefit ratio will tend to do very little to tackle those macroeconomic effects while increasing the contribution rate will actually tend to exacerbate them
2018-03-22;2018;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.9699363708496094;these findings are supported by model simulations
2018-03-22;2018;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.9871769547462464;that being said these results are by construction merely a general assessment of the macroeconomic effects of pension reforms and do not allow conclusions to be drawn regarding the reform agendas of specific countries
2018-03-22;2018;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.7090434432029724;at the same time forces relating to population ageing and pension reforms are a slowmoving determinant of the equilibrium real interest rate and need to be taken into account by a price stabilityoriented monetary policy

2018-03-22;2018;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.9000486135482788;recent literature points to a number of complementary structural channels which can explain the decline in equilibrium interest rates from a general equilibrium perspective
2018-03-22;2018;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.9807044863700868;model simulations broadly support these findings
2018-03-22;2018;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.9861300587654114;138 5 conclusions this article finds that population ageing will have major macroeconomic and fiscal implications for the euro area
2018-03-22;2018;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.9649126529693604;moreover the openness of an economy is relevant for the quantitative strength of all of these channels
2018-03-22;2018;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.5752531290054321;135 the abovementioned cumulative impact on equilibrium real interest rates will play out slowly over time given the slowmoving nature of demographic changes
2018-03-22;2018;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.9851985573768616;nevertheless it is important that this impact is recognised by monetary policymakers
2018-03-22;2018;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.9887719750404358;by way of illustration kara and thadden consider an environment with sticky prices in which the reaction function of monetary policy is characterised by a taylor rule
2018-03-22;2018;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Negative;0.9859760403633118;if that rule fails to incorporate the downward pressure on the equilibrium rate in a sufficiently timely manner there is a risk of an overly tight monetary policy stance and downward pressure on inflation
2018-03-22;2018;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.9869755506515504;however in line with the longterm neutrality of money the study also shows that such pressure disappears in the presence of flexible prices an assumption that is typically used when characterising the longterm developments discussed in this box
2018-03-22;2018;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.5443758368492126;136 if equilibrium real interest rates were to stay at low levels for a protracted period of time this would have implications for the conduct of monetary policy
2018-03-22;2018;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Negative;0.9816232919692992;with an unchanged inflation objective monetary policy would be likely to face challenges arising from the lower bound constraint on nominal interest rates more often
2018-03-22;2018;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.9873077273368835;this would naturally mean that other monetary policy tools such as forward guidance and nonstandard measures would have to complement the conventional interest rate channel more frequently than in the past
2018-03-22;2018;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.8897586464881897;137 moreover macroprudential tools could gain in importance in the event that frequently used nonstandard monetary policy tools were regarded as being conducive to risks to financial stability that needed to be contained
2018-03-22;2018;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.9885691404342652;as regards normative aspects a central banks objectives can be shaped by the age structure of the economy and its interaction with pension system design
2018-03-22;2018;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.822834312915802;it has traditionally been acknowledged that older societies attach more weight to price stability than to the stabilisation of output and employment  both in terms of the preferred longterm level of the price stability objective and in terms of the adjustment speed when returning to this level in response to shocks

2018-03-22;2018;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.9810857772827148;according to the authors traditional measures of credit constraints identify young and fastgrowing firms that obtain financing primarily from the equity and loan markets rather than capturing actual financial constraints

2018-03-22;2018;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Negative;0.985824465751648;they argue that this negative impact is due to the lack of access to bank finance implied by discouragement
