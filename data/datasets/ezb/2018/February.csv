2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9891811013221741;however the acceleration in the cyclical momentum and the ongoing reduction of economic slack strengthened the governing councils confidence that inflation would converge to its aim

2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Positive;0.5485724210739136;the strength of the forward guidance rested on the consistency of communication over time
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Positive;0.8912737369537354;the governing councils communication therefore needed to a acknowledge the robust pace of the economic expansion b confirm confidence that the upswing would eventually lead to inflation converging towards the ecbs aim and c reiterate the importance of patience and persistence in monetary policy for inflation pressures to build up and support convergence of inflation to levels below but close to 2
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9810820817947388;looking ahead the governing council would continue to assess progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9781650900840759;as previously communicated its assessment was based on three criteria first inflation should be on a path to reach levels below but close to 2 over the medium term and there should be no doubt about the commitment to reach this aim second the range of likely outcomes around that path should be reasonably contained and third the path should be maintained even in less supportive monetary policy conditions
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9895756244659424;once the governing council judged that these criteria were met net asset purchases would expire in line with the stated forward guidance
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.991719126701355;from that point in time the evolution of inflation would remain conditional on the reinvestment of principal payments continuing for an extended period of time and on policy rates remaining at their present levels well past the end of net asset purchases
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9883041381835938;2 governing councils discussion and monetary policy decisions economic and monetary analyses with regard to the economic analysis members broadly agreed with the assessment of the outlook and risks for economic activity in the euro area provided by mr praet in his introduction
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9920899868011475;according to recent data and survey results growth momentum continued to be solid and broadbased supported by very favourable financing conditions and pointed to a robust pace of economic expansion looking ahead
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9786755442619324;incoming information was considered to have corroborated the positive outlook for growth embedded in the december 2017 eurosystem staff projections as also reflected in the latest update of the imfs outlook for the euro area in which the forecast for euro area growth had been revised up substantially for both 2018 and 2019 as regards the outlook and risks for the external environment members agreed that the latest indicators pointed to a further improvement in global activity and trade
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9919424057006836;the picture of a robust global economic expansion was supported by the latest imf update with global forecasts being revised up for the current year and for 2019 there was also strong momentum in global trade which had recently been growing at rates above those of global activity
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9131712913513184;however the balance of risks to the global economic expansion was considered to remain tilted to the downside
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9909989833831787;while the recent tax reform in the united states might have a greater than expected impact on economic growth in the short term geopolitical uncertainties and uncertainty regarding the policy outlook in some major economies including the risk of an increase in trade protectionism continued to constitute downside risks
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9880390763282776;moreover although the past appreciation of the euro had so far had no significant negative impact on euro area external demand volatility in foreign exchange markets represented a further risk that needed monitoring
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9848423004150391;turning to euro area activity members agreed that recent indicators had provided further evidence that the economic expansion was robust and broadbased and was continuing to proceed at a pace above current estimates of potential growth
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9912294149398804;this strong cyclical momentum was leading to a reduction in economic slack and to increasing capacity utilisation rates
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9771450161933899;on the basis of the positive developments in shortterm indicators it was considered that quarterly real gdp growth around the turn of the year might again turn out to be higher than previously expected
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9930452704429626;in terms of the main components of demand private consumption growth remained strong supported by rising employment

2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9915715456008911;domestic demand prospects were also underpinned by continued improvements in household and corporate sector balance sheets facilitated by the ecbs monetary policy measures
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9893847107887268;meanwhile the broadbased global expansion was providing impetus to euro area exports
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9881360530853271;members exchanged views about developments in the labour market and the degree of labour market slack remaining in the euro area
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Positive;0.5877822041511536;in particular while further positive labour market developments were acknowledged  with employment and hours worked continuing to increase  attention was drawn to the fact that hours worked had not yet returned to their precrisis level
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9148271083831787;it was suggested that lower average hours worked relative to the precrisis period could be interpreted as evidence of continued labour market slack
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Negative;0.5187259316444397;a number of arguments were advanced to suggest that the decline in average hours since the crisis might at least to some degree have a more structural interpretation reflecting for instance changes in the sectoral composition of the economy such as the trend towards a larger services sector and increasing female participation rates
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.945801854133606;there were also indications that in some countries a sizeable proportion of parttime and temporary work could be considered as reflecting personal choices rather than underemployment
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Negative;0.984836757183075;however it was observed that longterm unemployment expectations had fallen to 75 in the spf for the first quarter of 2018 from close to 8 in the previous round
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9804249405860901;this decline in expectations could be seen as confirmation of the positive results achieved by structural reforms
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9805221557617188;at the same time as the actual unemployment rate in the euro area was currently 87 the results might also be interpreted as suggesting that a still considerable degree of slack remained in the labour market
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9465022683143616;a number of remarks were made about recent exchange rate developments
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9278002977371216;while the euro exchange rate was not a target of ecb policy movements in the exchange rate were deemed important insofar as they affected the outlook for growth and inflation in the euro area
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9824140071868896;it was also recalled from earlier governing council discussions that it was important to take into account the main factors behind the euros appreciation as the impact on activity and prices of a change in the exchange rate differed depending on the underlying causes
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9904800057411194;part of the exchange rate appreciation could be related to more positive sentiment towards the euro area resulting from improvements in the euro area economy
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9424542188644409;it was argued that an exchange rate appreciation linked to positive developments in domestic demand could be expected to have a lower passthrough to inflation as firms would likely use the strength of the economic situation as an opportunity to rebuild their profit margins which they had reduced during the crisis
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9838993549346924;however more recently the euros appreciation also reflected other factors including communication on exchange rates and on the monetary policy outlook across major currency areas
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Negative;0.4864843487739563;in such cases the passthrough to inflation could be stronger
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9783933758735657;it was also pointed out that the bilateral exchange rate of the euro against the us dollar had changed more than the euros nominal effective exchange rate
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Negative;0.7574290037155151;this had led market participants to attribute recent exchange rate volatility more to the weakness of the us dollar than to the strength of the euro
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Negative;0.69261234998703;however explaining the us dollar weakness was not straightforward given the strength of recent data releases and the fiscal and monetary policy outlook in the united states
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.987133264541626;this also had to be taken into account when considering the consequences of the exchange rate appreciation for the euro area economy
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.775900661945343;in addition an appreciation relative to an invoicing currency such as the us dollar could be more important for the strength of the passthrough than suggested by its weight in the effective exchange rate
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9534478783607483;the effect on the euro area economy would also depend on the extent and persistence of the exchange rate appreciation
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Negative;0.8648777008056641;in this context it was remarked that the euro exchange rate had been subject to pronounced swings in the past and that the rather limited ability of economists to predict future developments in the exchange rate including the risk of a further euro appreciation needed to be recognised
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9660241603851318;concerns were also expressed about recent statements in the international arena about exchange rate developments and more broadly the overall status of international relations
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8790658712387085;the importance of adhering to agreed statements on the exchange rate was emphasised such as that included in the october 2017 communiqué of the 36th meeting of the imfs international monetary and financial committee which stated that excessive volatility or disorderly movements in exchange rates could have adverse implications for economic and financial stability and that members would refrain from competitive devaluations and would not target their exchange rates for competitive purposes
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8289732336997986;overall there was broad agreement among members that the recent volatility in the exchange rate of the euro was a source of uncertainty which required monitoring with regard to its possible implications for the mediumterm outlook for price stability
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9929077625274658;the risks to the euro area growth outlook were assessed to have remained broadly balanced in line with the assessment made at the previous monetary policy meeting
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9855103492736816;with regard to price developments there was broad agreement with the assessment presented by mr praet in his introduction
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9379884600639343;annual euro area hicp inflation had declined to 14 in december 2017 compared with 15 in november
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9879885911941528;this decline mainly reflected developments in energy prices
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9713048338890076;annual hicp inflation excluding food and energy had remained stable at 09 in december 2017 unchanged from the previous two months but slightly below the levels recorded in mid2017 with the outlook for measures of underlying inflation considered to be broadly unchanged
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Negative;0.8283615112304688;members agreed that measures of underlying inflation in the euro area had remained subdued in part owing to special factors and had yet to show convincing signs of a sustained upward trend
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9831691980361938;underlying inflation measures were however expected to rise gradually over the medium term supported by the ecbs monetary policy measures the continuing economic expansion the corresponding absorption of economic slack and rising wage growth
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9923840165138245;in particular it was argued that the strong cyclical momentum the ongoing reduction of slack and increasing capacity utilisation further strengthened confidence in the baseline outlook for inflation
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Negative;0.666314959526062;the discrepancy also observed in other major economies between the ongoing expansion in economic activity and relatively subdued inflation dynamics was again highlighted
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.6731328368186951;on a more positive note it was pointed out that underlying measures of inflation had so far remained stable despite the appreciation of the exchange rate
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9845367074012756;it was furthermore noted that according to the december 2017 eurosystem staff projections annual hicp inflation excluding food and energy would reach 18 in 2020 while in the period prior to the financial crisis its average increase had been around 15
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9194825887680054;however a remark was made that in the absence of persistent positive contributions to price developments from food and energy components in the future underlying inflation would need to be higher than its precrisis average if the ecb was to meet its inflation aim on a sustained basis
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Negative;0.5175994634628296;with regard to wage growth it was observed that annual increases in compensation per employee had increased somewhat since the second quarter of 2016 and had stood at 17 in the third quarter of 2017 although wage dynamics were still considered to be relatively subdued it was expected that cost pressures would gradually increase as the economic expansion continued and slack in the labour market was absorbed
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9910893440246582;however wage forecasts in the past had been too high and the pickup in wages as embodied in the projections was still uncertain
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.984872579574585;members also took note of recent developments in inflation expectations
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9914221167564392;both marketbased measures and surveybased measures were broadly unchanged for longerterm horizons
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9847127199172974;with regard to the monetary analysis members concurred with the assessment presented by mr praet in his introduction
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9889912605285645;broad money m3 had continued to expand at a robust pace
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9909934401512146;the gradual recovery in the growth of loans to the private sector visible since the start of 2014 was proceeding amid a further pickup in the growth of loans to nfcs and households
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9185563325881958;the expansion in credit continued to be supported by very favourable borrowing costs for firms and households across the euro area
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.47075751423835754;it was nonetheless noted that deleveraging in the nonfinancial private sectors had progressed further according to various measures
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Negative;0.5287538766860962;this was seen as reassuring for the credit outlook and also from a financial stability perspective
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9821668863296509;reference was also made to evidence from the bank lending survey for the fourth quarter of 2017 which indicated that loan growth continued to be supported by increasing demand and a further easing in overall lending conditions
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9884154796600342;monetary policy stance and policy considerations with regard to the monetary policy stance members widely shared the assessment provided by mr praet in his introduction
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9919785261154175;the strong cyclical momentum and the associated ongoing reduction of economic slack further strengthened the confidence that inflation would converge to the governing councils inflation aim
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9504123330116272;at the same time underlying price pressures remained muted overall and had yet to show convincing signs of a sustained upward trend
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.7911548018455505;overall this assessment confirmed the continued need for an ample degree of monetary accommodation to ensure a sustained adjustment of inflation towards the governing councils inflation aim
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9913771152496338;accordingly this suggested leaving the current policy configuration unchanged and reconfirming the decisions taken at the october 2017 monetary policy meeting
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9899817109107971;there was broad agreement among members that the current monetary policy stance remained broadly appropriate
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.5856298208236694;with regard to financial market conditions equity prices had further increased in the intermeeting period while there had been an upward move in the expected path of shortterm interest rates and a rise in longterm government bond yields together with an appreciation of the euro
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9844905734062195;it was noted that while longterm yields had indeed increased somewhat overall similar levels had already been observed in the course of last year
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9912659525871277;moreover these increases were unlikely to translate immediately into more restrictive borrowing conditions for households and firms as bank lending rates in particular responded only with some lag to tighter capital market conditions
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Negative;0.8505748510360718;several factors contributing to the limited tightening in some measures of financial conditions were discussed
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9761480093002319;while this could be seen as partly related to a further improvement in domestic fundamentals spillovers from global financial conditions as well as heightened sensitivity of financial markets to communication on exchange rates and monetary policy also played a role
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8764513731002808;in this context the point was reiterated that the monetary policy stance tended to become mechanically more expansionary in an environment of improving macroeconomic conditions and an unchanged policy configuration other things being equal
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Positive;0.864090085029602;the incoming information while again more positive on euro area growth prospects was seen as confirming the current policy posture as the strong growth momentum was still accompanied by weak price pressures
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9817288517951965;against this overall background members widely agreed that while there was reason to be increasingly confident about the path of inflation patience and persistence with regard to monetary policy were still warranted for inflation to converge to the governing councils inflation aim in a sustained manner
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9883251190185547;this called for maintaining the current monetary policy stance which related to the full set of policy instruments
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.992156982421875;it also implied reaffirming the monetary policy decisions taken at the monetary policy meeting in late october with respect to net asset purchases and reinvestments as well as key policy interest rates together with the governing councils forward guidance pertaining to those measures including the established embedded sequencing of policy instruments
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9008753299713135;an ample degree of monetary stimulus was generally seen to be still needed to accompany the economic expansion and the corresponding buildup of price pressures in support of headline inflation developments over the medium term
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.7503290772438049;it was recalled that while the relative importance of policy rate guidance and of the accumulated stock of assets for the overall stance of policy was increasing over time the path of inflation still remained contingent on the continued stimulus provided by the full set of the ecbs policy measures including the net asset purchases
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9796482920646667;in this context a remark was made regarding possible implications of the current accommodative monetary policy stance for financial stability in specific market segments such as highyield corporate bonds and commercial real estate
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9739739894866943;it was however recalled that the evidence currently available suggested no significant side effects of the ecbs monetary policy measures on financial stability on the whole and that in any case macroprudential policy tools were to be seen as the first line of defence in addressing potential financial stability risks
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9877290725708008;as regards communication agreement was generally expressed with the proposal made by mr praet in his introduction suggesting broad continuity in the governing councils communication at the present stage
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8379393219947815;members widely acknowledged the need for steadiness in communication which entailed reemphasising confidence in the inflation outlook while maintaining a policy stance based on the broad spectrum of policy instruments in place and the established sequencing of policy instruments
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9823236465454102;in this context it was remarked that communication on monetary policy would continue to develop according to the evolving state of the economy in line with the ecbs forward guidance with a view to avoiding abrupt or disorderly adjustments at a later stage
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9220172762870789;however changes in communication were generally seen to be premature at this juncture as inflation developments remained subdued despite the robust pace of economic expansion
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Positive;0.8553622961044312;therefore the governing council reiterated its steadfast commitment to its price stability objective and specifically to delivering on its promise to secure a sustained return of inflation rates to levels below but close to 2
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9206240773200989;it was emphasised that monetary policy had to remain patient and persistent while prudence should be exercised with respect to the governing councils communication
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9780500531196594;there was broad agreement among members to convey the governing councils concerns about the recent volatility in the euro exchange rate which represented a source of uncertainty that had to be monitored with respect to its implications for the mediumterm outlook for price stability
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.7213418483734131;in this context it was also seen as important to reaffirm the agreed g7 and g20 exchange rate language which entailed the commitment to marketdetermined exchange rates and refraining from targeting them for competitive purposes
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.7663629651069641;finally the ongoing need for decisive reform efforts by euro area governments to strengthen the longerterm growth potential and to reduce vulnerabilities was reiterated
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9494954347610474;in this context it was stressed that the strengthening of economic and monetary union remained a priority
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9695916175842285;hence the ongoing discussions on completing the banking union and the capital markets union and on further deepening economic and monetary union were highly welcome
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Negative;0.8477630615234375;a remark was also made on the increasingly widespread prospects of a loosening of the fiscal stance in a range of jurisdictions including some with no or limited fiscal space
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9721742868423462;this warranted reiterating calls for respecting the existing fiscal rules and for rebuilding fiscal buffers in particular in countries where government debt remained high
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8992033004760742;members broadly agreed that any further evolution of the governing councils communication on monetary policy would be gradual and would proceed in line with improvements in the mediumterm inflation outlook
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9947918057441711;communication would evolve naturally in line with the ecbs forward guidance should inflation make further progress towards the governing councils inflation aim as set out in the established criteria for a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9927944540977478;the language pertaining to the monetary policy stance could be revisited early this year as part of the regular reassessment at the forthcoming monetary policy meetings
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9107731580734253;in this context some members expressed a preference for dropping the easing bias regarding the app from the governing councils communication as a tangible reflection of reinforced confidence in a sustained adjustment of the path of inflation
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Negative;0.7390761971473694;however it was concluded that such an adjustment was premature and not yet justified by the stronger confidence
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9587088227272034;it was also recalled  as on previous occasions  that even when net purchases were terminated the monetary policy stance would remain highly accommodative as the evolution of inflation would remain conditional on reinvestments continuing for an extended period of time and on policy rates remaining at their present levels well past the end of the ecbs net asset purchases
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9935344457626343;monetary policy decisions and communication taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members on a proposal from the president the governing council decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility would remain unchanged at 000 025 and 040 respectively
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9708134531974792;the governing council continued to expect the key ecb interest rates to remain at their present levels for an extended period of time and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9937494993209839;with regard to nonstandard monetary policy measures the governing council confirmed that the net asset purchases at the new monthly pace of 30 billion were intended to run until the end of september 2018 or beyond if necessary and in any case until the governing council saw a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9481282234191895;if the outlook became less favourable or if financial conditions became inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation the governing council stood ready to increase the app in terms of size andor duration
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9852264523506165;the eurosystem would reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the app for an extended period of time after the end of its net asset purchases and in any case for as long as necessary
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9642565846443176;this would contribute both to favourable liquidity conditions and to an appropriate monetary policy stance
2018-02-22;2018;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9883117079734802;the members of the governing council subsequently finalised the draft introductory statement which the president and the vicepresident would as usual deliver at the press conference following the end of the current governing council meeting
