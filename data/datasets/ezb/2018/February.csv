2018-02-08;2018;February;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.9593423008918762;immigration has two main impacts first it influences the composition of total employment and second it impacts the labour market situation of nationals
2018-02-08;2018;February;Monetary Policy Decisions;Negative;0.947072207927704;a reversal of the recent increase in labour supply is expected in the medium term owing to the ageing of the population

2018-02-08;2018;February;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.5086586475372314;48 the complementarity of immigrants may also help nationals to increase their labour market participation hours worked or their skill level
2018-02-08;2018;February;Monetary Policy Decisions;Positive;0.9880863428115844;47 also crosscountry evidence in oecd countries points to overall positive effects from immigration
2018-02-08;2018;February;Monetary Policy Decisions;Positive;0.6681508421897888;empirical studies in both europe and the united states have mostly shown that immigrants bring complementary skills ideas and connections and fill important niches in both fastgrowing and declining sectors of the economy
2018-02-08;2018;February;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.6290332674980164;the increasing employment of these groups also explains at least partially the recent developments in parttime and temporary employment
2018-02-08;2018;February;Monetary Policy Decisions;Positive;0.938187539577484;this was driven primarily by a strong increase in the female employment rate the ratio of employed women to the female working age population and to a smaller extent by a declining employment rate for men the ratio of employed men to the male working age population over the crisis period see chart 11

2018-02-08;2018;February;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.9603792428970336;in the light of these caveats data on migration must be assessed with caution
2018-02-08;2018;February;Monetary Policy Decisions;Negative;0.9576622247695924;this is due to the lack of detailed statistics on the origin of people with a migration background
2018-02-08;2018;February;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.7192411422729492;third an additional problem with stock variables as opposed to flows is that calculating the number of immigrant workers or the size of immigrant labour supply for the euro area as a whole is virtually impossible

2018-02-08;2018;February;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.978135108947754;a major part of the recent population growth in several euro area countries can be linked to developments in migration

2018-02-08;2018;February;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.8988018035888672;overall the rise in parttime employment from 2008 was primarily demand rather than supplydriven as shown by the increase in underemployment
2018-02-08;2018;February;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.9427143335342408;indeed the numbers of unemployed looking only for fulltime work decreased after 2008 while the numbers of those who had no clear preference increased substantially see chart 18
2018-02-08;2018;February;Monetary Policy Decisions;Negative;0.671313464641571;further increases in the labour market participation of older workers as well as the continuing concentration of employment growth in services are likely to support this

2018-02-08;2018;February;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.5491280555725098;in other countries emigrants were primarily nationals whose destination was in many cases germany owing to high labour demand in that country
2018-02-08;2018;February;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.8702325820922852;the largest contribution came from spain which witnessed largescale immigration before the crisis which then became emigration partly by precrisis immigrants

2018-02-08;2018;February;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.9097792506217957;the inflow at the euro area level continued after the start of the crisis owing to a large degree to the opening up of the german and austrian labour markets in 2011 and 2014 for nationals of the countries that joined the eu in 2004 and in 2007 respectively
