2018-05-24;2018;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9884810447692871;it was underlined that this moderation in growth had come after a period of very strong growth and when incoming data had surprised on the upside
2018-05-24;2018;May;REPORT;Negative;0.7468339800834656;this moderation might therefore reflect in part an expected normalisation from last years exceptionally high growth rates while unexpected temporary factors were also seen to have played a role
2018-05-24;2018;May;REPORT;Positive;0.8631777167320251;hence the underlying growth momentum was on the whole assessed to remain intact
2018-05-24;2018;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9669668078422546;at the same time it was widely felt that uncertainty surrounding the outlook had increased and caution was seen as warranted in interpreting recent developments also because the moderation in growth appeared to be broadbased across countries and sectors

2018-05-24;2018;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9920098781585693;in particular concern was expressed that trade conflicts might not only have an adverse impact on activity for the countries involved via reduced trade but could exert broader effects as a consequence of increased uncertainty and diminished confidence
2018-05-24;2018;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9729549288749695;some of this uncertainty was related to upcoming decisions on trade policies
2018-05-24;2018;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9884915351867676;it was also remarked that turbulent trade relations had the potential to give rise to disorderly movements in exchange rates and to heightened volatility in financial markets
2018-05-24;2018;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9860068559646606;the impact of trade protectionism and of possible retaliatory measures on global and euro area economic growth was considered as ranging from limited to having more substantial effects depending on the scale of the imposed tariffs and on the diversion of trade flows and relocation of production in response to such measures
2018-05-24;2018;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9874675869941711;reference was also made to evidence suggesting quantitatively large effects from the uncertainty associated with protracted tensions in trade relations
2018-05-24;2018;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9917029738426208;some euro area economies might have been seeing such effects in recent months for example in weaker export orders

2018-05-24;2018;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9916749596595764;members concurred that the underlying growth momentum in the euro area and its largest economies remained broadly intact and expressed confidence in the continuation of the expansion at a solid pace
2018-05-24;2018;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9260725975036621;the observation was made that while there had been a decline in hard data and surveybased indicators since the governing councils march monetary policy meeting which had been rather broadbased both across euro area countries and across economic sectors the indicators remained at elevated levels and were still clearly above their longrun historical averages
2018-05-24;2018;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9783837199211121;in exchanging views about the interpretation of incoming information members shared information on recent developments in the respective national economies and sought to provide an assessment of the factors behind the signs of weaker activity
2018-05-24;2018;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9870391488075256;a number of reasons of a temporary nature could in part explain a stronger than anticipated moderation
2018-05-24;2018;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.4898064136505127;for many economies reference was made to the possible impact of weather conditions earlier in the year which implied a loss in value added in some sectors of the economy such as construction or retail but could equally imply gains in other sectors such as those related to energy
2018-05-24;2018;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9204890131950378;other temporary factors related to strikes affecting certain sectors of the economy and the unusually severe wave of seasonal influenza in some countries
2018-05-24;2018;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.709286093711853;for the euro area as a whole it was underlined that the signs of a moderation in economic growth at the start of the year did not change the picture regarding the underlying pace of expansion
2018-05-24;2018;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9943901896476746;in some parts of the euro area and in some sectors the moderation in growth could be attributed to capacity constraints becoming increasingly binding
2018-05-24;2018;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9496820569038391;this was seen as consistent with the survey evidence on increasing labour supply shortages suppliers delivery times and order backlogs provided by mr praet in his introduction
2018-05-24;2018;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9920010566711426;it was argued that in the absence of supply constraints there would be an elastic response of output to changes in demand but as capacity constraints were reached growth in activity could be expected to slow down with price pressures picking up instead
2018-05-24;2018;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9943406581878662;however it was also argued that there were signs of softening demand which warranted monitoring
2018-05-24;2018;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9872226715087891;in this context it was recalled that while the direction of change in the measures of slack was clear the measurement of the level of the output gap was surrounded by considerable uncertainty as had been discussed by the governing council at its march monetary policy meeting
2018-05-24;2018;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9580004215240479;looking ahead members agreed that the underlying strength of the economic expansion remained broadly intact
2018-05-24;2018;May;REPORT;Negative;0.5829191207885742;at the same time uncertainty surrounding the outlook had clearly increased and data releases ahead of the june monetary policy meeting would need to be carefully scrutinised to better understand the sources of the recent moderation in growth
2018-05-24;2018;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9813925623893738;in this regard it was also deemed important to gain a deeper understanding of the reasons behind the high degree of synchronicity in the downturn in indicators which might point to a broader weakening of demand
2018-05-24;2018;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9432291984558105;the need to closely monitor and assess the incoming data was emphasised
2018-05-24;2018;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9884451627731323;more generally it was necessary to distinguish between temporary and potentially more lasting influences and to determine the extent to which they reflected a softening in demand as opposed to the emergence of supply constraints
2018-05-24;2018;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9212648868560791;this latter distinction was seen as especially relevant as supply constraints had opposite implications for price pressures

2018-05-24;2018;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9864381551742554;it was noted that in some cases this might not only reflect a reduction in labour market slack and higher productivity but also a stronger role of the inflation expectations component in wage settlements
2018-05-24;2018;May;REPORT;Positive;0.983967125415802;at the same time evidence for some euro area economies suggested that there was stronger dynamism in the labour costs of the selfemployed as reflected in the prices that they charged for their services

2018-05-24;2018;May;REPORT;Negative;0.981913149356842;the slight moderation in the growth rate of m3 was seen to reflect mainly a decline in the contribution of credit to general government amid the reduction in monthly purchase volumes by the eurosystem under the asset purchase programme app
