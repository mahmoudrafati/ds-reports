2018-05-10;2018;May;Monetary Policy Decisions;Negative;0.98458731174469;this is partly due to the destructive impact of the yugoslav wars in the 1990s which delayed the economic transition process in many western balkan economies by nearly a decade

2018-05-10;2018;May;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.9779226779937744;thus if βconvergence holds poorer countries grow faster than richer ones but higher growth rates may not be sufficient to equalise income levels across countries over time due to high initial income differences between them so σconvergence does not necessarily follow
2018-05-10;2018;May;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.792945146560669;the concept of βconvergence derives from the neoclassical growth framework and is based on the assumption of diminishing returns to capital
2018-05-10;2018;May;Monetary Policy Decisions;Positive;0.9810742735862732;30 in this framework capitalscarce lowincome economies exhibit higher returns on this factor of production than capitalabundant highincome ones which promotes faster capital accumulation and economic growth in the former group of economies
2018-05-10;2018;May;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.9869590401649476;the concept of the conditionality of convergence is also often discussed in the literature
2018-05-10;2018;May;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.9878485202789308;conditional convergence takes into account that institutional settings or policies may differ across countries
2018-05-10;2018;May;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.9589738249778748;thus economies may converge towards different steady states and economic growth in poorer economies may not automatically be higher than that in richer ones whereas unconditional absolute convergence suggests that poorer countries grow faster than richer ones irrespective of the institutional settings or policies pursued
2018-05-10;2018;May;Monetary Policy Decisions;Negative;0.508743405342102;βconvergence implies that lowerincome countries tend to grow faster than higherincome ones and is a necessary but not sufficient condition for σconvergence which entails that the dispersion in real incomes among countries tends to diminish over time
2018-05-10;2018;May;Monetary Policy Decisions;Negative;0.9935958981513976;while some countries have experienced fast economic growth and a speedy catchingup for others the catchingup process has been rather slow

2018-05-10;2018;May;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.975370228290558;some new eu member states such as the czech republic slovenia and slovakia have by now reached gdp per capita levels somewhat above 80 of the eu average based on 2016 data

2018-05-10;2018;May;Monetary Policy Decisions;Negative;0.6029855012893677;moreover some papers have shown that risk sharing in the united states has been increasing over time which could be in part due to banking deregulation

2018-05-10;2018;May;Monetary Policy Decisions;Positive;0.8807745575904846;this points to a large potential for risk sharing achieved via the crossborder ownership of productive assets in the context of regions with a sufficiently heterogeneous degree of economic development

2018-05-10;2018;May;Monetary Policy Decisions;Negative;0.986971914768219;second while in the united states the credit channel accounts for about 20 of risk sharing over the sample period in the euro area its contribution is negative although small
2018-05-10;2018;May;Monetary Policy Decisions;Negative;0.9586726427078248;99 a negative contribution to risk sharing via the credit channel in the euro area implies borrowing abroad in economic good times and repayment of the loans in economic bad times adding volatility to consumption in a procyclical way
2018-05-10;2018;May;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.9897550940513612;97 estimates are performed on windows of ten years eg
2018-05-10;2018;May;Monetary Policy Decisions;Positive;0.9793389439582824;100 these findings suggest that a complete banking union is a fundamental prerequisite for the credit channel to contribute positively to risk sharing as the case of the united states emphasises
2018-05-10;2018;May;Monetary Policy Decisions;Positive;0.8472703695297241;finally the capital channel in the united states helps smooth between 30 and 35 of a statespecific shock accounting for more than half of overall risk sharing
2018-05-10;2018;May;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.9750116467475892;in the euro area too this channel explains the bulk of the observed crossborder risk sharing
2018-05-10;2018;May;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.8969256281852722;however with the exception of the period 19982009 its contribution is smaller than in the united states amounting on average to around 20
2018-05-10;2018;May;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.9614869356155396;in conclusion the evidence for the united states is fairly consistent with earlier studies finding a large contribution from private financial channels to risk sharing
