2009-05-07;2009;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9435484409332275;let me now explain our assessment in some more detail starting with the economic analysis
2009-05-07;2009;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9935846924781799;reflecting the impact of the financial market turmoil economic activity continued to weaken in the euro area in the course of the first quarter of 2009 in parallel with the ongoing downturn in the world economy

2009-05-07;2009;May;REPORT;Negative;0.48642322421073914;more recently there have been some tentative signs in survey data of a stabilisation albeit at very low levels
2009-05-07;2009;May;REPORT;Positive;0.7961004972457886;overall economic activity is likely to be very weak for the remainder of this year before gradually recovering in the course of 2010 in particular the substantial fall in commodity prices since the summer of 2008 is supporting real disposable income and thus consumption
2009-05-07;2009;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9901803731918335;in addition external as well as domestic demand should increasingly benefit from the effects of the significant macroeconomic stimulus under way as well as from the measures taken so far to restore the functioning of the financial system both inside and outside the euro area
2009-05-07;2009;May;REPORT;Negative;0.8941858410835266;taking all these measures and their effects into account as well as the pronouncedly negative growth in the first quarter of this year and the most recently published forecasts by public institutions the risks to this outlook remain broadly balanced

2009-05-07;2009;May;REPORT;Positive;0.989692747592926;at the same time there may be stronger than anticipated positive effects due to the decrease in commodity prices and to the policy measures taken

2009-05-07;2009;May;REPORT;Negative;0.98971027135849;as explained on earlier occasions the decline in inflation since last summer primarily reflects the sharp fall in global commodity prices over this period
2009-05-07;2009;May;REPORT;Negative;0.7593724131584167;moreover signs of a more broadbased reduction in inflationary pressure are increasingly emerging
2009-05-07;2009;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.972513735294342;looking ahead base effects stemming from past energy price movements will play a significant role in the shorterterm dynamics of the hicp
2009-05-07;2009;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9546676278114319;accordingly we expect to see headline annual inflation rates declining further and temporarily remaining at negative levels for some months around midyear

2009-05-07;2009;May;REPORT;Negative;0.99498450756073;looking further ahead hicp inflation is likely to remain positive and below 2 in 2010 with price developments being dampened by ongoing sluggish demand in the euro area and elsewhere
2009-05-07;2009;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9932494163513184;available indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the governing councils aim of keeping inflation rates at levels below but close to 2 over the medium term
2009-05-07;2009;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9617466330528259;the risks surrounding this outlook are broadly balanced

2009-05-07;2009;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9884185194969177;turning to the monetary analysis the latest data confirm the continued deceleration in the pace of underlying monetary expansion
2009-05-07;2009;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9338715076446533;this is signalled for instance by the concurrent further declines in the annual growth rates of m3 to 51 and of loans to the private sector to 32
2009-05-07;2009;May;REPORT;Negative;0.7097455859184265;the deceleration supports the assessment of diminishing inflationary pressures in the medium term
2009-05-07;2009;May;REPORT;Negative;0.6242265701293945;monthonmonth developments in m3 and its components have remained volatile with data for march showing a contraction in most of the respective outstanding amounts
2009-05-07;2009;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9425053596496582;this may partly reflect market participants investment responses to the past reduction in the key ecb interest rates which has reduced the remuneration of shortterm deposits and marketable instruments and fostered corresponding shifts in the allocation of funds not only within m3 but also to instruments outside m3
2009-05-07;2009;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9921293258666992;the outstanding amount of mfi loans to the private sector contracted further in march reflecting mainly a negative flow of lending to nonfinancial corporations

2009-05-07;2009;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9917581677436829;the decline in shortterm lending is likely to reflect to a large extent lower demand in the wake of a sharp deterioration in economic activity and business prospects at the start of the year
2009-05-07;2009;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9860978126525879;interest rates on shortterm and floating rate bank loans to households and nonfinancial corporations have declined significantly over recent months indicating that the transmission of monetary policy impulses to the economy continues
2009-05-07;2009;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.8896037936210632;overall the latest money and credit data support the assessment that both banks and moneyholding sectors are reducing their highly leveraged positions built up in past years

2009-05-07;2009;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9884335398674011;a crosscheck with the outcome of the monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressure has been diminishing as money and credit growth have further decelerated in recent months
2009-05-07;2009;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9744165539741516;against the background of these developments after todays decisions we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households
2009-05-07;2009;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.7590391635894775;all in all since the intensification of the financial crisis in september 2008 the eurosystem has taken a series of measures that are unprecedented in nature scope and timing
2009-05-07;2009;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9760088920593262;as a consequence we have observed a clear decline in key money market interest rates that euro area banks typically use as benchmarks to reset floating rate loans and price new shortterm loans
2009-05-07;2009;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9911705255508423;this in turn has led to sharp declines in rates for such loans to households and nonfinancial corporations
2009-05-07;2009;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9638526439666748;as the transmission of monetary policy works with lags our policy action will progressively feed through to the economy in full

2009-05-07;2009;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.8073992133140564;the governing council will ensure that once the macroeconomic environment improves the measures taken can be quickly unwound and the liquidity provided absorbed so that any threat to price stability over the medium to longer term can be effectively countered in a timely fashion
2009-05-07;2009;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9756677746772766;indeed as has been stressed many times the governing council will continue to ensure a firm anchoring of mediumterm inflation expectations
2009-05-07;2009;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9729530811309814;such anchoring is indispensable to supporting sustainable growth and employment and contributes to financial stability
2009-05-07;2009;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9682788252830505;accordingly we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead
2009-05-07;2009;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9652589559555054;regarding fiscal policies the latest projections for euro area countries point to continued revisions to budget balance estimates and forecasts
2009-05-07;2009;May;REPORT;Positive;0.978643000125885;higher budget deficits and the fiscal impact of financial sector support measures will lead to significantly higher government debttogdp ratios
2009-05-07;2009;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9852465391159058;in addition updated projections by the economic policy committee of the eu show that most countries face a challenging task in dealing with the budgetary costs of an ageing population
2009-05-07;2009;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9786797761917114;therefore it is paramount that countries make a strong and credible commitment to a path of consolidation in order to return to sound fiscal positions respecting fully the provisions of the stability and growth pact

2009-05-07;2009;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.7643523216247559;the credibility of fiscal consolidation commitments will be strengthened if they are part of national policy frameworks oriented to the medium term
