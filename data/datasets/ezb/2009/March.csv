2009-03-05;2009;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9934595823287964;reflecting the impact of the financial market turmoil the world economy has weakened substantially in recent months affecting increasingly also emerging market economies
2009-03-05;2009;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9944909811019897;in a climate of heightened uncertainty a severe fall in world trade volumes has been accompanied by a pronounced decline in domestic demand in the euro area
2009-03-05;2009;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.895209014415741;as a consequence euro area real gdp contracted markedly in the fourth quarter of 2008 by 15 on a quarterly basis according to eurostats first estimate
2009-03-05;2009;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9834949374198914;available data and survey indicators suggest that economic activity in the euro area remained weak in early 2009 looking ahead the governing council expects that both global and domestic demand will decline in 2009 but thereafter recover gradually
2009-03-05;2009;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9134414792060852;this assessment is also reflected in the march 2009 ecb staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area which place annual real gdp growth in a range of 32 to 22 in 2009 and between 07 and 07 in 2010 these ranges represent a downward revision of the december 2008 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections
2009-03-05;2009;March;REPORT;Negative;0.7349486947059631;in both 2009 and 2010 the annual gdp growth rate will be significantly reduced by negative carryover effects from the previous year
2009-03-05;2009;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9638006091117859;the projected gradual recovery in 2010 reflects the effects of the substantial macroeconomic stimulus under way as well as of the extensive policy measures that have been introduced to restore the functioning of the financial system both inside and outside the euro area
2009-03-05;2009;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9380127787590027;in addition the fall in commodity prices is expected to support real disposable income and consumption in the period ahead
2009-03-05;2009;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9831988215446472;the outlook for the economy continues to be surrounded by uncertainty
2009-03-05;2009;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.6197708249092102;in the view of the governing council the risks to the economic outlook now appear to be more balanced
2009-03-05;2009;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9919405579566956;on the one hand there may be stronger than anticipated positive effects also on confidence stemming from the extensive macroeconomic stimulus under way and reflecting other policy measures taken
2009-03-05;2009;March;REPORT;Positive;0.5518160462379456;on the other hand concerns relate mainly to the potential for a stronger impact on the real economy of the turmoil in financial markets as well as to the emergence and intensification of protectionist pressures and to possible adverse developments in the world economy stemming from a disorderly correction of global imbalances
2009-03-05;2009;March;REPORT;Negative;0.8281437754631042;with regard to price developments annual hicp inflation has been steadily declining since the middle of 2008 when it reached a peak of 40
2009-03-05;2009;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9880461692810059;in february 2009 it was 12 according to eurostats flash estimate broadly unchanged from 11 in january
2009-03-05;2009;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9904306530952454;the decline in inflation since last summer primarily reflects the sharp falls in global commodity prices over this period
2009-03-05;2009;March;REPORT;Negative;0.5854257345199585;however signs of a more broadbased reduction in inflationary risks are also increasingly emerging
2009-03-05;2009;March;REPORT;Negative;0.95662921667099;reflecting these trends the march 2009 ecb staff inflation projections constitute a significant downward revision compared with the previous projections and foresee annual hicp inflation at between 01 and 07 in 2009 owing mainly to base effects stemming from the past behaviour of energy prices headline annual inflation rates are projected to decline further in the coming months possibly temporarily reaching negative levels around midyear
2009-03-05;2009;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9852102398872375;thereafter annual inflation is expected to increase again also owing to base effects stemming from past energy price developments
2009-03-05;2009;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9809461236000061;accordingly it is likely that hicp inflation rates will fluctuate noticeably during 2009 such shortterm volatility is however not relevant from a monetary policy perspective
2009-03-05;2009;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9824486374855042;for 2010 ecb staff project hicp inflation at between 06 and 14

2009-03-05;2009;March;REPORT;Negative;0.7721653580665588;available forecasts from international organisations have also been revised downwards and broadly confirm an outlook of moderate inflation rates in 2010 as in the case of growth a considerable degree of uncertainty surrounds the inflation projections
2009-03-05;2009;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9024832248687744;risks to these projections are broadly balanced
2009-03-05;2009;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.7529743313789368;they relate in particular to the risks to the outlook for economic activity as well as to risks to commodity prices
2009-03-05;2009;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9876129031181335;turning to the monetary analysis the latest data and estimates provide further evidence of an ongoing deceleration in the underlying pace of monetary expansion in the euro area
2009-03-05;2009;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9024727940559387;this implies a further reduction in inflationary risks in the medium term
2009-03-05;2009;March;REPORT;Negative;0.8198646306991577;the further deceleration in underlying monetary dynamics has contrasted with the high monthtomonth volatility of developments in m3 and its components which has been observed since the financial turmoil intensified in september 2008 this relates in particular to marketable instruments but also to the significant substitution that is taking place between different categories of deposits included in m3
2009-03-05;2009;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.5166372060775757;while annual m3 growth declined further to 59 in january 2009 the annual growth rate of the narrow aggregate m1 which includes the most liquid assets rose to 52
2009-03-05;2009;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9834731221199036;volatility also characterised the flow of mfi loans to the private sector around the turn of the year with a monthly contraction in the outstanding amount in december followed by a significantly positive flow in january
2009-03-05;2009;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9816805124282837;however discounting a possible turnoftheyear effect and looking beyond these latest developments confirms the decline in the growth of bank credit to households and nonfinancial corporations observed in 2008 at the same time it appears that the substantial past reduction in the key ecb interest rates is increasingly being passed through to bank lending rates indicating that despite the tensions in financial markets the transmission mechanism of monetary policy is not significantly hampered in the euro area
2009-03-05;2009;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9567822217941284;still more data and analysis are needed to firmly assess the outlook for credit in the period ahead
2009-03-05;2009;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9242246150970459;to sum up inflation rates have decreased significantly and are now expected to remain well below 2 over 2009 and 2010 recent economic data releases and survey information add further evidence to our assessment that both global and euro area demand are likely to be very weak in 2009 over the course of 2010 the economy is expected to gradually recover

2009-03-05;2009;March;REPORT;Negative;0.987650990486145;regarding the fiscal policy responses to the economic downturn the euro area countries updated stability programmes and recent addenda confirm the prospect of a sharp and broadbased deterioration in euro area public finances
2009-03-05;2009;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9666568040847778;a credible commitment to a path of consolidation in order to return to sound fiscal positions respecting fully the provisions of the stability and growth pact is necessary to maintain the publics trust in the sustainability of public finances which is important both for the economy to recover and for supporting longterm growth
2009-03-05;2009;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9821459650993347;in this respect we support the commissions intention to initiate excessive deficit procedures for several countries
2009-03-05;2009;March;REPORT;Negative;0.7511507272720337;this is crucial to preserve the credibility of the eu fiscal surveillance framework
2009-03-05;2009;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9795246720314026;it is important that clear deadlines are set for correction of the excessive deficits and that consolidation plans are based on firm and wellspecified structural measures
2009-03-05;2009;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9141108393669128;as regards structural policies it remains important to pursue economic policies in line with the principle of an open market economy with free competition
2009-03-05;2009;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9072747826576233;in this respect it is essential that government support measures do not distort competition and delay necessary structural adjustment and it is of the utmost importance to avoid protectionist measures
2009-03-05;2009;March;REPORT;Negative;0.7021777033805847;refraining from protectionism will be key to allowing the global economy to overcome the current crisis more rapidly
2009-03-05;2009;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9660996794700623;the successful completion of the doha round of trade negotiations would also be a milestone towards a more integrated and open world economy for the benefit of all
