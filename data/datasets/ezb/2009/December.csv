2009-12-03;2009;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.935492992401123;let me now explain our assessment in greater detail starting with the economic analysis
2009-12-03;2009;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9920690059661865;economic activity in the euro area improved further in the third quarter of 2009 with real gdp growth returning to positive territory following five quarters of contraction
2009-12-03;2009;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.91139817237854;according to eurostats first estimate real gdp increased by 04  quarter on quarter
2009-12-03;2009;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9917558431625366;available survey data suggest that the recovery is continuing during the fourth quarter of 2009 at present the euro area is benefiting from the inventory cycle and a recovery in exports as well as from the significant macroeconomic stimulus under way and the measures adopted to restore the functioning of the financial system
2009-12-03;2009;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9822180867195129;however a number of the supporting factors are of a temporary nature and activity is likely to be affected for some time to come by the ongoing process of balance sheet adjustment in the financial and the nonfinancial sector both inside and outside the euro area
2009-12-03;2009;December;REPORT;Negative;0.974414050579071;for this reason the euro area economy is expected to grow only at a moderate pace in 2010 and the recovery process is likely to be uneven
2009-12-03;2009;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9873073101043701;eurosystem staff project annual real gdp growth of between 41 and 39 in 2009 between 01 and 15 in 2010 and between 02 and 22 in 2011 the range for 2010 has been revised upwards compared with the september 2009 ecb staff macroeconomic projections
2009-12-03;2009;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9890072345733643;forecasts by international organisations are broadly in line with the december 2009 eurosystem staff projections
2009-12-03;2009;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9660271406173706;the governing council continues to view the risks to this outlook as broadly balanced
2009-12-03;2009;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9916632175445557;on the upside there may be stronger than anticipated effects stemming from the extensive macroeconomic stimulus being provided and from other policy measures taken
2009-12-03;2009;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9919403195381165;confidence may also improve further and foreign trade may recover more strongly than projected
2009-12-03;2009;December;REPORT;Negative;0.9786592125892639;on the downside concerns remain relating to a stronger or more protracted than expected negative feedback loop between the real economy and the financial sector renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices the intensification of protectionist pressures and the possibility of disruptive market movements related to the correction of global imbalances
2009-12-03;2009;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9543381929397583;with regard to price developments as expected euro area annual hicp inflation has turned positive again after five months of negative rates
2009-12-03;2009;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9733800888061523;according to eurostats flash estimate it stood at 06 in november up from 01 in october
2009-12-03;2009;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.8720102906227112;the rise mainly reflects upward base effects stemming from the drop in global commodity prices a year ago
2009-12-03;2009;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.6828014850616455;inflation is expected to rise further in the near term mainly owing to upward base effects in the energy and food components
2009-12-03;2009;December;REPORT;Negative;0.992486834526062;looking further ahead inflation is expected to remain moderate over the policyrelevant horizon with overall price cost and wage developments staying subdued in line with a slow recovery in demand in the euro area and elsewhere
2009-12-03;2009;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9912216663360596;in this context it is important to reemphasise that inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the governing councils aim of keeping inflation rates below but close to 2 over the medium term
2009-12-03;2009;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9889670014381409;consistent with this assessment the december 2009 eurosystem staff projections foresee annual hicp inflation of 03 in 2009 between 09 and 17 in 2010 and between 08 and 20 in 2011 compared with the september 2009 ecb staff projections the inflation projections for 2010 remain largely unchanged
2009-12-03;2009;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9808593392372131;available forecasts from international organisations provide a broadly similar picture
2009-12-03;2009;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.8692217469215393;risks to this outlook remain broadly balanced
2009-12-03;2009;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9600492715835571;they relate in particular to the outlook for economic activity and the evolution of commodity prices
2009-12-03;2009;December;REPORT;Positive;0.987246036529541;furthermore increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be stronger than currently expected owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years
2009-12-03;2009;December;REPORT;Negative;0.9796867370605469;turning to the monetary analysis the data for october confirm the ongoing decline in the annual growth rates of m3 and loans to the private sector to 03 and 08 respectively
2009-12-03;2009;December;REPORT;Negative;0.8975265622138977;these concurrent declines continue to support the assessment of a moderate underlying pace of monetary expansion and low inflationary pressures over the medium term
2009-12-03;2009;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.8332344889640808;at the same time the annual growth rate of m1 was 118 in october 2009 down from 128 in september mainly reflecting a base effect
2009-12-03;2009;December;REPORT;Negative;0.9815173745155334;the current decline in the annual growth rates of monetary aggregates is influenced by a number of special factors and is thereby likely to overstate the deceleration in the underlying pace of monetary expansion
2009-12-03;2009;December;REPORT;Negative;0.9239522814750671;first base effects associated with the intensification of the financial turmoil in autumn 2008 have had a downward effect on the annual growth rate of m3 in the past two months
2009-12-03;2009;December;REPORT;Negative;0.991502046585083;second and more fundamentally the steep slope of the yield curve provides an incentive to shift funds out of m3 into longerterm deposits and securities thereby dampening m3 growth
2009-12-03;2009;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9484233260154724;the current constellation of interest rates also continues to trigger shifts of funds within m3 as the narrow spread between the rates on different shortterm deposits reduces the opportunity costs of holding the most liquid assets contained in m1
2009-12-03;2009;December;REPORT;Negative;0.9905019998550415;the annual growth rate of bank loans to the nonfinancial private sector turned somewhat more negative in october
2009-12-03;2009;December;REPORT;Positive;0.5328138470649719;in the case of loans to households the latest data provide further confirmation of a levellingoff at low rates of growth
2009-12-03;2009;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.8717998266220093;as regards loans to nonfinancial corporations it is worthwhile to note that the growth of loans to enterprises typically picks up with some lag compared with the cycle in economic activity
2009-12-03;2009;December;REPORT;Negative;0.9942822456359863;in this respect the still subdued levels of production and trade as well as the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the business outlook are likely to dampen firms demand for bank financing also in the coming months especially for shortterm loans
2009-12-03;2009;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9925017356872559;at the same time overall financing conditions continue to improve which should support the demand for loans in the period ahead
2009-12-03;2009;December;REPORT;Negative;0.9638481736183167;banks are currently faced with the challenge of managing the size and structure of their overall balance sheets and at the same time ensuring the availability of credit to the nonfinancial sector
2009-12-03;2009;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9601185917854309;against the background of their improved liquidity situation and access to market financing banks should address this challenge by taking appropriate measures to strengthen further their capital bases and where necessary take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation
2009-12-03;2009;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.987593948841095;to sum up the current rates remain appropriate
2009-12-03;2009;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9740489721298218;taking into account all the information and analyses that have become available since our meeting on 5 november 2009 price developments are expected to remain subdued over the policyrelevant horizon

2009-12-03;2009;December;REPORT;Negative;0.8480023741722107;crosschecking the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressure over the medium term as money and credit growth continues to slow down
2009-12-03;2009;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9268136620521545;all in all we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households
2009-12-03;2009;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9816344380378723;with all the measures we have taken in response to the intensification of the financial crisis we have supported both the availability of liquidity to the banking sector and the recovery of the euro area economy
2009-12-03;2009;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.7435746192932129;as the transmission of monetary policy works with lags we expect that our policy action will continue to progressively feed through to the economy
2009-12-03;2009;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9769617915153503;we will continue our enhanced credit support to the banking system while taking into account the ongoing improvement in financial market conditions and avoiding distortions associated with maintaining nonstandard measures for too long
2009-12-03;2009;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.988745391368866;looking ahead the governing council will gradually phase out at the appropriate time the extraordinary liquidity measures that are not needed to the same extent as in the past
2009-12-03;2009;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9799681901931763;in order to counter effectively any threat to price stability over the medium to longer term the liquidity provided will be absorbed when necessary
2009-12-03;2009;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9884824156761169;in this way the governing council will continue to ensure a firm anchoring of mediumterm inflation expectations
2009-12-03;2009;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9776480197906494;such anchoring is indispensable to supporting sustainable growth and employment and contributing to financial stability
2009-12-03;2009;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9682788252830505;accordingly we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead
2009-12-03;2009;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9841326475143433;as regards fiscal policies we reemphasise how important it is for governments to develop communicate and implement ambitious fiscal consolidation strategies in a timely manner
2009-12-03;2009;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9833906888961792;these strategies must be based on realistic output growth assumptions and focus on structural expenditure reforms not least with a view to coping with the budgetary burden associated with an ageing population
2009-12-03;2009;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9738499522209167;as agreed by the ecofin council on 2 december 2009 governments need to set out concrete and quantifiable adjustment measures that will lead to a sustainable correction of fiscal imbalances
2009-12-03;2009;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.984779953956604;several countries will have to start consolidation in 2010 and all others in 2011 at the latest
2009-12-03;2009;December;REPORT;Negative;0.8417725563049316;with regard to structural reforms most estimates indicate that the financial crisis has reduced the productive capacity of our economies and will continue to do so for some time to come
2009-12-03;2009;December;REPORT;Positive;0.7351763248443604;in order to support sustainable growth and employment labour market flexibility and more effective incentives to work will be needed
2009-12-03;2009;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.8618481159210205;furthermore policies that enhance competition and innovation are also urgently needed to speed up restructuring and investment and to create new business opportunities
