2009-01-15;2009;January;REPORT;Negative;0.5688976645469666;since september 2008 the financial market turmoil has intensified and broadened
2009-01-15;2009;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9912159442901611;tensions have increasingly spilled over from the financial sector into the real economy
2009-01-15;2009;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9944725632667542;as a result economic activity throughout the world including in the euro area has weakened further
2009-01-15;2009;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9928550124168396;in particular foreign demand for euro area exports has declined and euro area domestic activity has contracted in the face of weaker demand prospects and tighter financing conditions
2009-01-15;2009;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9946568012237549;the survey data and monthly indicators for november and december that have become available since our last meeting clearly point to a further weakening of economic activity around the turn of the year indicating the materialisation of previously identified downside risks to activity
2009-01-15;2009;January;REPORT;Negative;0.993818461894989;looking further ahead on the basis of our current analysis and assessment we continue to see global economic weakness and very sluggish domestic demand persisting in the coming quarters as the impact of the financial tensions on activity continues
2009-01-15;2009;January;REPORT;Positive;0.8983793258666992;at the same time we expect the fall in commodity prices to support real disposable income in the period ahead
2009-01-15;2009;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9843583106994629;furthermore the euro area should over time reap the full benefit from the effects of policy measures announced over recent weeks in the view of the governing council this outlook for the economy remains surrounded by an exceptionally high degree of uncertainty
2009-01-15;2009;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9927172660827637;overall risks to economic growth remain clearly on the downside
2009-01-15;2009;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9805107712745667;they relate mainly to the potential for a stronger impact on the real economy of the turmoil in financial markets as well as to concerns about the emergence and intensification of protectionist pressures and to possible adverse developments in the world economy stemming from a disorderly correction of global imbalances
2009-01-15;2009;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9031199812889099;it is crucial that all parties concerned make their contribution to lay sound foundations for a sustainable recovery
2009-01-15;2009;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.6316477656364441;for this to materialise as early as possible it is of the utmost importance to maintain discipline and a mediumterm perspective in macroeconomic policymaking pursuing a stabilityoriented and sustainable approach
2009-01-15;2009;January;REPORT;Positive;0.8521133065223694;this is the best way to preserve and enhance confidence
2009-01-15;2009;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9892488718032837;the significant measures being implemented by governments to deal with the financial turmoil should help to ensure trust in the financial system and to ease constraints on credit supply to companies and households

2009-01-15;2009;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9873998165130615;hicp inflation was 16 in december after 21 in november
2009-01-15;2009;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9939596652984619;as we have emphasised on previous occasions the significant decline in headline inflation in the second half of 2008 reflects mainly the sharp falls in global commodity prices over the past few months
2009-01-15;2009;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9912717938423157;looking forward lower commodity prices and weakening demand confirm that inflationary pressures in the euro area are diminishing
2009-01-15;2009;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9398425817489624;owing mainly to base effects stemming from the past behaviour of energy prices headline annual inflation rates are projected to decline further in the coming months possibly reaching very low levels at midyear
2009-01-15;2009;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.8807321190834045;however also owing to base effects stemming from past energy price developments inflation rates are expected to increase again in the second half of the year
2009-01-15;2009;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9729726314544678;hence it is likely that hicp inflation rates will fluctuate sharply during 2009 such shortterm volatility is however not relevant from a monetary policy perspective
2009-01-15;2009;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9895572066307068;looking over the policyrelevant mediumterm horizon annual hicp inflation is expected to be in line with price stability
2009-01-15;2009;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9868655800819397;this assessment is supported by available indicators of inflation expectations for the medium term
2009-01-15;2009;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9158732891082764;risks to price stability over the medium term are broadly balanced
2009-01-15;2009;January;REPORT;Positive;0.6194531917572021;unexpected further declines in commodity prices or a stronger than expected slowdown in the economy could put downward pressure on inflation while upside risks to price stability could materialise particularly if the recent fall in commodity prices were to reverse or if domestic price pressures turn out to be stronger than assumed
2009-01-15;2009;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.7403020858764648;it is therefore crucial that price and wagesetters fully live up to their responsibilities
2009-01-15;2009;January;REPORT;Positive;0.5770939588546753;turning to the monetary analysis the latest evidence confirms a moderating rate of monetary expansion in the euro area
2009-01-15;2009;January;REPORT;Positive;0.5415701270103455;monetary trends therefore support the view that inflationary pressures and risks are diminishing
2009-01-15;2009;January;REPORT;Negative;0.6955609321594238;in analysing monetary developments it should be recognised that the intensification of the financial market turmoil since midseptember has the potential to affect the evolution of monetary aggregates significantly
2009-01-15;2009;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9347102046012878;recent money and credit data indicate that this has already had a substantial impact on the behaviour of market participants
2009-01-15;2009;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.5679967999458313;both the broad aggregate m3 and in particular the components of m3 that are most closely related to the ongoing financial tensions  such as holdings of money market funds  have shown high monthtomonth volatility of late
2009-01-15;2009;January;REPORT;Negative;0.8716676831245422;overall however looking to the extent possible through this volatility the rate of broad money growth continues to moderate in line with the trend established over the past 18 months with the intensification of financial tensions since september leading to significant substitution among the components of m3 rather than at least so far sharp changes in the trend of m3 itself
2009-01-15;2009;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9937819838523865;turning to the evolution of bank loans the tightening of financing conditions resulting from the intensification of the financial tensions has contributed to a slowdown in the flow of monetary financial institution mfi loans to the nonfinancial private sector in recent months
2009-01-15;2009;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.8806632161140442;more data and further analysis are necessary to form a robust judgement about the severity and scope of credit constraints and their possible implications for economic activity
2009-01-15;2009;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9713112115859985;to sum up we decided to reduce the interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the eurosystem by a further 50 basis points bringing the total reduction since 8 october 2008 to 225 basis points

2009-01-15;2009;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.8366238474845886;the governing council recalls its operational decision taken on 18 december 2008 to widen again the corridor formed by the rates on the eurosystems standing facilities as of 21 january 2009 looking forward we continue to expect inflation rates in the euro area to be in line with price stability over the policyrelevant mediumterm horizon thereby supporting the purchasing power of incomes and savings
2009-01-15;2009;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9814766049385071;after todays decision we consider risks to price stability over the mediumterm to be broadly balanced

2009-01-15;2009;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.959095299243927;a crosscheck of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms this view
2009-01-15;2009;January;REPORT;Negative;0.951070249080658;monetary expansion is moderating further supporting the assessment that inflationary pressures and risks are diminishing
2009-01-15;2009;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9789066314697266;all in all the level of uncertainty remains exceptionally high
2009-01-15;2009;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9910756349563599;the governing council will continue to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with its mediumterm objective of inflation rates below but close to 2
2009-01-15;2009;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9860196113586426;this supports sustainable growth and employment and contributes to financial stability
2009-01-15;2009;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9682788252830505;accordingly we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead
2009-01-15;2009;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9586040377616882;regarding fiscal policies the governing council welcomes the european councils reconfirmation of its full commitment to sustainable public finances
2009-01-15;2009;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.7940567135810852;in this respect the current economic situation calls for particular prudence with regard to the adoption of extensive fiscal stimulus measures taking into account the particular fiscal situation in each country
2009-01-15;2009;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9434762597084045;the operation of automatic stabilisers will provide a relatively large and powerful fiscal impulse to the weakening economy in addition to already announced expansionary fiscal policy measures and the government support for the banking sector
2009-01-15;2009;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9823242425918579;taken together the additional measures decided so far put a considerable burden on public finances in a large number of euro area countries
2009-01-15;2009;January;REPORT;Negative;0.922221302986145;if not reversed in due time this will negatively affect in particular the younger and future generations
2009-01-15;2009;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.8830134272575378;it is therefore essential to return to a credible commitment to mediumterm budgetary objectives as soon as possible
2009-01-15;2009;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9853706359863281;the significant fiscal loosening and the implied increase in government debt should in any case not risk undermining public confidence in the sustainability of public finances thereby detracting from the effectiveness of a fiscal stimulus
2009-01-15;2009;January;REPORT;Negative;0.8984629511833191;turning to structural policies the ongoing period of weak economic activity and high uncertainty about the economic outlook imply the need to strengthen the resilience and flexibility of the euro area economy
2009-01-15;2009;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9785984754562378;product market reforms should foster competition and speed up effective restructuring
2009-01-15;2009;January;REPORT;Positive;0.7161284685134888;labour market reforms should help to facilitate appropriate wagesetting as well as labour mobility across sectors and regions
