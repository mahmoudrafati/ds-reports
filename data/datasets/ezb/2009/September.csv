2009-09-03;2009;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9448356628417969;let me now explain our assessment in further detail starting with the economic analysis
2009-09-03;2009;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9858341813087463;following the strong negative growth rates observed around the turn of the year according to eurostats first estimate economic activity in the euro area declined only slightly in the second quarter of 2009 contracting by 01 compared with the previous quarter

2009-09-03;2009;September;REPORT;Positive;0.9846178293228149;in addition the inventory cycle is expected to contribute positively
2009-09-03;2009;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9176853895187378;however uncertainty remains high and the persistent volatility in incoming data warrants a cautious interpretation of available information
2009-09-03;2009;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9600558280944824;overall the recovery is expected to be rather uneven given the temporary nature of some of the supporting factors and the ongoing balance sheet correction in the financial and nonfinancial sectors of the economy both inside and outside the euro area
2009-09-03;2009;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.988903820514679;this assessment is broadly in line with the september 2009 ecb staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area
2009-09-03;2009;September;REPORT;Positive;0.8664132356643677;according to these projections average annual real gdp growth will range between 44 and 38 in 2009 and between 05 and 09 in 2010 compared with the june 2009 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections this implies an upward revision of the ranges for both 2009 and 2010 reflecting mainly the recent more positive developments and information
2009-09-03;2009;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9901475310325623;forecasts by international organisations are broadly in line with the september 2009 ecb staff projections
2009-09-03;2009;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9305509924888611;in the view of the governing council the risks to this outlook remain broadly balanced
2009-09-03;2009;September;REPORT;Positive;0.9916632175445557;on the upside there may be stronger than anticipated effects stemming from the extensive macroeconomic stimulus being provided and from other policy measures taken
2009-09-03;2009;September;REPORT;Positive;0.9867761731147766;confidence may also improve more quickly labour market deterioration may be less marked than currently expected and foreign demand may prove to be stronger than projected
2009-09-03;2009;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9842970967292786;on the downside concerns remain relating to a stronger or more protracted negative feedback loop between the real economy and the still strained financial markets renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices the intensification of protectionist pressures and a disorderly correction of global imbalances
2009-09-03;2009;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9927790760993958;at the same time the uncertainty surrounding this outlook remains higher than usual
2009-09-03;2009;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9878987669944763;with regard to price developments annual hicp inflation was according to eurostats flash estimate 02 in august  compared with 07 in july
2009-09-03;2009;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9855495095252991;this development is in line with previous expectations and reflects largely base effects resulting from the movements in global commodity prices a year ago
2009-09-03;2009;September;REPORT;Positive;0.8327670097351074;owing to these base effects annual inflation rates are projected to turn positive again within the coming months
2009-09-03;2009;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9758186936378479;looking further ahead inflation is expected to remain in positive territory with overall price and cost developments staying subdued in the wake of ongoing sluggish demand in the euro area and elsewhere
2009-09-03;2009;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9925462603569031;in this context it is important to reemphasise that the indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the governing councils aim of keeping inflation rates below but close to 2 over the medium term
2009-09-03;2009;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.991023063659668;this outlook is consistent with the september 2009 ecb staff projections for euro area inflation
2009-09-03;2009;September;REPORT;Positive;0.8643487095832825;in these projections annual hicp inflation is projected to range between 02 and 06 in 2009 and between 08 and 16 in 2010 revised slightly upwards from the june 2009 eurosystem staff projections reflecting mainly upward revisions to energy prices
2009-09-03;2009;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9808593392372131;available forecasts from international organisations provide a broadly similar picture
2009-09-03;2009;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.7933074235916138;risks to the outlook for price developments remain broadly balanced
2009-09-03;2009;September;REPORT;Positive;0.5169336795806885;they relate in particular to the outlook for economic activity and to higher than expected commodity prices
2009-09-03;2009;September;REPORT;Positive;0.987246036529541;furthermore increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be stronger than currently expected owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years
2009-09-03;2009;September;REPORT;Negative;0.993178129196167;turning to the monetary analysis the latest data confirm a continued deceleration in both broad money and credit growth
2009-09-03;2009;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9833869338035583;in july the annual growth rates of m3 and loans to the private sector declined further to 30 and 06 respectively reaching new lows since 1999 these developments support the assessment of a slower underlying pace of monetary expansion and low inflationary pressures over the medium term
2009-09-03;2009;September;REPORT;Negative;0.7400145530700684;the shortterm developments of m3 and its components have remained volatile
2009-09-03;2009;September;REPORT;Positive;0.9789953827857971;the recent changes in interest rates paid on the different instruments included in m3 have continued to underlie the strong shifts in the allocation of funds from in particular shortterm time deposits to overnight deposits
2009-09-03;2009;September;REPORT;Positive;0.9599819183349609;the deceleration in annual m3 growth has thus continued to combine with a substantial further strengthening of annual m1 growth which in july rose to 121
2009-09-03;2009;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9942008852958679;in addition the relatively steep yield curve and the reemergence of risk appetite reflected particularly in the increase in stock prices over the past few months may have dampened m3 growth to some extent
2009-09-03;2009;September;REPORT;Negative;0.8634554743766785;the overall flow of bank loans to the nonfinancial private sector remained subdued in july with the differences across borrowing sectors becoming more marked
2009-09-03;2009;September;REPORT;Positive;0.4357464611530304;the flow of loans to households remained slightly positive whereas in the case of nonfinancial corporations the flow of loans was negative again
2009-09-03;2009;September;REPORT;Positive;0.6976328492164612;the decline in loans to nonfinancial corporations continues to reflect mainly a strong net redemption of loans with a shorter maturity while lending and borrowing at longer maturities remained positive
2009-09-03;2009;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9930510520935059;the fall in production and trade and the ongoing uncertainty in the business outlook are likely to have dampened firms demand for financing
2009-09-03;2009;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9939672946929932;given the normal lag between a recovery in economic activity and a pickup in loans to enterprises further weak developments in loans to nonfinancial corporations in the coming months appear likely
2009-09-03;2009;September;REPORT;Positive;0.9922971129417419;at the same time a gradual improvement in financing conditions as lower market interest rates continue to be passed on in lower bank lending rates should support the demand for credit in the period ahead
2009-09-03;2009;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.7032515406608582;against the background of highly demanding challenges banks should take appropriate measures to strengthen further their capital bases and where necessary take full advantage of government measures to support the financial sector particularly as regards recapitalisation
2009-09-03;2009;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.988952100276947;to sum up the information and analyses that have become available since our meeting on 6 august 2009 confirms the view of the governing council that the current key ecb interest rates remain appropriate

2009-09-03;2009;September;REPORT;Negative;0.6151122450828552;a crosscheck of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressure over the medium term as money and credit expansion continues to decelerate
2009-09-03;2009;September;REPORT;Positive;0.908145010471344;against this background we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term thereby continuing to support the purchasing power of euro area households
2009-09-03;2009;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9531888365745544;as the transmission of monetary policy works with lags we expect that our policy action will progressively feed through to the economy in full
2009-09-03;2009;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.7972174882888794;hence with all the measures taken monetary policy is providing ongoing support for households and corporations
2009-09-03;2009;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.6668809652328491;once the macroeconomic environment improves the governing council will make sure that the measures taken are unwound in a timely fashion and that the liquidity provided is absorbed in order to counter effectively any threat to price stability over the medium to longer term
2009-09-03;2009;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9764377474784851;by so doing the governing council will continue to ensure a firm anchoring of mediumterm inflation expectations
2009-09-03;2009;September;REPORT;Positive;0.9776480197906494;such anchoring is indispensable to supporting sustainable growth and employment and contributing to financial stability
2009-09-03;2009;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9682788252830505;accordingly we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead
2009-09-03;2009;September;REPORT;Negative;0.7821010947227478;as regards fiscal policies the latest quarterly euro area data and developments in individual countries confirm a substantial deterioration of fiscal positions in 2009 which is projected to continue in 2010 in finalising their 2010 budgets and mediumterm fiscal plans governments must now substantiate their commitment to ensuring a swift return to sound and sustainable public finances in line with the stability and growth pact
2009-09-03;2009;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.5132107734680176;in particular it is crucial that ambitious and realistic fiscal exit and consolidation strategies underpinned by concrete structural measures are put in place
2009-09-03;2009;September;REPORT;Negative;0.7511917352676392;the structural adjustment process should start in any case not later than the economic recovery and the consolidation efforts should be stepped up in 2011 structural consolidation efforts will need to exceed significantly the benchmark of 05 of gdp per annum set in the stability and growth pact
2009-09-03;2009;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9839312434196472;in countries with high deficits andor debt ratios the annual structural adjustment should reach at least 1 of gdp
2009-09-03;2009;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9520674347877502;the focus of the structural measures should lie on the expenditure side as in most euro area countries tax and social contribution rates are already high
