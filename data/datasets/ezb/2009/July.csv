2009-07-02;2009;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9921694397926331;on the positive side there may be stronger than anticipated effects stemming from the extensive macroeconomic stimulus being provided and from other policy measures taken
2009-07-02;2009;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9856995940208435;confidence may also improve more quickly than currently expected
2009-07-02;2009;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9854491353034973;on the other hand concerns remain relating to a stronger or more protracted negative feedback loop between the real economy and the turmoil in financial markets further increases in oil and other commodity prices the intensification of protectionist pressures increasingly unfavourable labour markets and lastly adverse developments in the world economy stemming from a disorderly correction of global imbalances

2009-07-02;2009;July;REPORT;Negative;0.8430922031402588;as explained on previous occasions the further decline in annual rates of inflation was anticipated and reflects primarily base effects resulting from past sharp swings in global commodity prices
2009-07-02;2009;July;REPORT;Negative;0.8962067365646362;looking ahead owing to these base effects annual inflation rates are projected to remain temporarily in negative territory over the coming months before turning positive again
2009-07-02;2009;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9831604361534119;such shortterm movements are not relevant from a monetary policy perspective
2009-07-02;2009;July;REPORT;Negative;0.7821905016899109;consistent with available forecasts and projections looking further ahead inflation is expected to remain in positive territory while price and cost developments are expected to remain dampened in the wake of ongoing sluggish demand in the euro area and elsewhere
2009-07-02;2009;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9921770691871643;in this respect indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the governing councils aim of keeping inflation rates below but close to 2 over the medium term
2009-07-02;2009;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9538037776947021;risks to the outlook for inflation are broadly balanced
2009-07-02;2009;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.5889710187911987;on the downside they relate in particular to the outlook for economic activity while on the upside they relate to higher than expected commodity prices

2009-07-02;2009;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9879107475280762;this concurrent deceleration supports the assessment of a slower underlying pace of monetary expansion and low inflationary pressures over the medium term
2009-07-02;2009;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9760299921035767;in may the outstanding amounts of most components of m3 showed a contraction reflecting to a large extent the recent declines in interest rates paid on shortterm deposits and marketable instruments and the increased allocation of funds to instruments outside m3 that these may have fostered
2009-07-02;2009;July;REPORT;Positive;0.6898383498191833;following a substantial strengthening in april the growth of m1 while having remained strong also moderated in may
2009-07-02;2009;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.5762614607810974;the shortterm developments in m3 have been volatile over the past few months
2009-07-02;2009;July;REPORT;Negative;0.991901695728302;looking beyond this volatility the pace of monetary expansion has clearly slowed since the last quarter of 2008 the flow of bank loans to nonfinancial corporations and households has remained subdued reflecting in part the weakening in economic activity and the continued low levels of business and consumer confidence
2009-07-02;2009;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9782358407974243;a moderate monthly contraction in the outstanding amount of loans to nonfinancial corporations has been observed over recent months
2009-07-02;2009;July;REPORT;Negative;0.5422493815422058;these developments are mostly due to a decline in shortterm lending while the flow of loans with longer maturities has remained slightly positive
2009-07-02;2009;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9832452535629272;in this respect it is important to note that past reductions in key ecb rates have continued to be passed on through lending rates to both nonfinancial corporations and households
2009-07-02;2009;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9921637773513794;the resulting improvement in financing conditions should provide ongoing support for economic activity in the period ahead
2009-07-02;2009;July;REPORT;Positive;0.7487388253211975;however as we have stressed in the past given the challenges that lie ahead banks should take appropriate measures to strengthen further their capital bases and where necessary take full advantage of government measures to support the financial sector particularly as regards recapitalisation
2009-07-02;2009;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9657192230224609;to sum up the current rates remain appropriate taking into account all the information and analyses that have become available since our meeting on 4 june 2009 the fall of annual inflation rates into negative territory in june is in line with previous expectations and reflects mainly temporary effects

2009-07-02;2009;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.992998480796814;available indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the governing councils aim of keeping inflation rates below but close to 2 over the medium term
2009-07-02;2009;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9398765563964844;a crosscheck of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis corroborates the assessment of low inflationary pressure as money and credit indicators continue to be weak
2009-07-02;2009;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9677037000656128;against this background we expect the current episode of extremely low or negative inflation rates to be shortlived and price stability to be maintained over the medium term thereby continuing to support the purchasing power of euro area households
2009-07-02;2009;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.6087921261787415;as the transmission of monetary policy works with lags our policy action should progressively feed through to the economy in full
2009-07-02;2009;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8121592998504639;hence with all the measures taken monetary policy will provide ongoing support for households and corporations

2009-07-02;2009;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9719654321670532;this operation at a fixed interest rate of 1 is expected to strengthen further the liquidity position of banks and to support the normalisation of money markets and the extension of credit to the economy alongside the other measures of enhanced credit support
2009-07-02;2009;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.929135799407959;once the macroeconomic environment improves the governing council will ensure that the measures taken are quickly unwound and that the liquidity provided is absorbed
2009-07-02;2009;July;REPORT;Negative;0.8430218696594238;hence any threat to price stability over the medium to longer term can be effectively countered in a timely fashion
2009-07-02;2009;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9728701710700989;as has been emphasised many times the governing council will continue to ensure a firm anchoring of mediumterm inflation expectations
2009-07-02;2009;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9729530811309814;such anchoring is indispensable to supporting sustainable growth and employment and contributes to financial stability
2009-07-02;2009;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9682788252830505;accordingly we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead

2009-07-02;2009;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9772824048995972;a return to sound sustainable public finances thus strengthening overall macroeconomic stability must be ensured
2009-07-02;2009;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8399246335029602;against this background euro area governments should prepare and communicate ambitious and realistic fiscal exit and consolidation strategies within the framework of the stability and growth pact
2009-07-02;2009;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8908398747444153;in the view of the governing council the structural adjustment process should start in any case not later than the economic recovery
2009-07-02;2009;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.939888596534729;in 2011 the consolidation efforts should be stepped up
2009-07-02;2009;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.5013538002967834;to correct the envisaged large fiscal imbalances of euro area countries structural consolidation efforts will need to exceed significantly the benchmark of 05 of gdp per annum set in the stability and growth pact
2009-07-02;2009;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9839312434196472;in countries with high deficits andor debt ratios the annual structural adjustment should reach at least 1 of gdp

2009-07-02;2009;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9857624769210815;at the same time many of the policy measures taken in recent months with a view to supporting specific segments of the economy should be phased out in a timely manner
2009-07-02;2009;July;REPORT;Positive;0.8869302868843079;it is crucial that the focus is now on strengthening the adjustment capacity and flexibility of the euro area economy in line with the principle of an open market economy and free competition
