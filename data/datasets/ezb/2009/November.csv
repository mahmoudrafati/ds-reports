2009-11-05;2009;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9305509924888611;in the view of the governing council the risks to this outlook remain broadly balanced
2009-11-05;2009;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9916632175445557;on the upside there may be stronger than anticipated effects stemming from the extensive macroeconomic stimulus being provided and from other policy measures taken

2009-11-05;2009;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8111377954483032;the current negative inflation rates are in line with previous expectations and reflect mainly movements in global commodity prices over the last year
2009-11-05;2009;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8344666361808777;in the coming months annual inflation rates are projected to turn positive again also relating to base effects
2009-11-05;2009;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9913895726203918;thereafter over the policyrelevant horizon inflation is expected to remain positive with overall price and cost developments staying subdued reflecting ongoing sluggish demand in the euro area and elsewhere
2009-11-05;2009;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9912216663360596;in this context it is important to reemphasise that inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the governing councils aim of keeping inflation rates below but close to 2 over the medium term
2009-11-05;2009;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8692217469215393;risks to this outlook remain broadly balanced

2009-11-05;2009;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9650135636329651;these concurrent declines support the assessment of a moderate underlying pace of monetary expansion and low inflationary pressures over the medium term

2009-11-05;2009;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.7742977142333984;in this respect it is worthwhile to note that the growth of loans to enterprises typically only picks up with some lag compared with the cycle in economic activity
2009-11-05;2009;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9921442270278931;at the same time the ongoing improvement in financing conditions should support the demand for credit in the period ahead
2009-11-05;2009;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.7032515406608582;against the background of highly demanding challenges banks should take appropriate measures to strengthen further their capital bases and where necessary take full advantage of government measures to support the financial sector particularly as regards recapitalisation

2009-11-05;2009;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8737881183624268;looking ahead and taking into account the improved conditions in financial markets not all our liquidity measures will be needed to the same extent as in the past
2009-11-05;2009;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9674921631813049;accordingly the governing council will make sure that the extraordinary liquidity measures taken are phased out in a timely and gradual fashion and that the liquidity provided is absorbed in order to counter effectively any threat to price stability over the medium to longer term
2009-11-05;2009;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9764377474784851;by so doing the governing council will continue to ensure a firm anchoring of mediumterm inflation expectations
2009-11-05;2009;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9776480197906494;such anchoring is indispensable to supporting sustainable growth and employment and contributing to financial stability

2009-11-05;2009;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9899660348892212;if not addressed by a clear and credible exit strategy this could seriously risk undermining public confidence in the sustainability of public finances and the economic recovery
2009-11-05;2009;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9890775680541992;the very large government borrowing requirements carry the risk of triggering rapid changes in market sentiment leading to less favourable medium and longterm interest rates
2009-11-05;2009;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9872530102729797;this in turn would dampen private investment and thereby weaken the foundations for a return to sustained growth
2009-11-05;2009;November;REPORT;Negative;0.975540816783905;moreover high public deficits and debts may complicate the task of the single monetary policy to maintain price stability
2009-11-05;2009;November;REPORT;Positive;0.7043856382369995;the governing council therefore calls upon governments to communicate and implement in a timely fashion ambitious fiscal exit and consolidation strategies based on realistic growth assumptions with a strong focus on expenditure reforms
2009-11-05;2009;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9180833101272583;tax cuts should only be considered over the medium term when countries have regained sufficient room for budgetary manoeuvre
2009-11-05;2009;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9842178821563721;in this regard the recent ecofin council conclusions which call for consolidation to start in 2011 at the latest and to go well beyond the structural benchmark of 05 of gdp per annum represent the minimum requirement for all euro area countries

2009-11-05;2009;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9728509783744812;turning to structural reforms in all countries more efforts are crucial to support sustainable growth and employment as it is likely that the financial crisis has affected the productive capacity of our economies
