2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9578161835670471;we will now report on the outcome of todays meeting of the governing council which was also attended by commissioner almunia
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9928567409515381;on the basis of its regular economic and monetary analyses the governing council decided to leave the key ecb interest rates unchanged
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9908730983734131;the current rates are appropriate taking into account our decisions of early may including the enhanced credit support measures and all the information and analyses which have become available since then
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9932441115379333;we confirmed our expectation that price developments over the policyrelevant horizon will remain dampened by the marked weakening of economic activity in the euro area and globally
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9813453555107117;recent survey information indicates that following two quarters of very negative growth economic activity over the remainder of this year is expected to decline at much less negative rates
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Positive;0.8459979891777039;after a stabilisation phase positive quarterly growth rates are expected by mid2010
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Negative;0.8657310009002686;this assessment incorporates adverse lagged effects such as a further deterioration in labour markets which are likely to materialise over the coming months
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9940872192382812;at the same time available indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the governing councils aim of keeping inflation rates below but close to 2 over the medium term
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Negative;0.8392879962921143;the outcome of the monetary analysis supports the assessment of moderate inflationary pressure as money and credit growth have further declined on an annual basis
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9178056716918945;against this background we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9435484409332275;let me now explain our assessment in some more detail starting with the economic analysis
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9665060043334961;reflecting the impact of the financial market turmoil and in particular a sharp fall in global demand and trade economic activity weakened considerably in the first quarter of 2009 according to eurostats first estimate economic activity in the euro area contracted by 25 quarter on quarter after a decline of 18 in the fourth quarter of 2008 this will have a significant negative impact on the average growth rate for 2009 however more recently there have been improvements in survey data albeit at very low levels
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9525746703147888;in line with such evidence after the extremely weak first quarter activity over the remainder of this year is expected to decline at much less negative rates
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Positive;0.8459979891777039;after a stabilisation phase positive quarterly growth rates are expected by mid2010
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9576295614242554;this assessment is broadly in line with the june 2009 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area according to which annual real gdp growth will range between 51 and 41 in 2009 and between 10 and 04 in 2010 compared with the march 2009 ecb staff macroeconomic projections the ranges have been revised downwards in particular for 2009 a substantial negative carryover effect from the previous year and the very weak result for the first quarter of 2009 significantly contributed to this downward revision
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9685932993888855;the projected gradual recovery next year with rates of growth returning to positive levels by mid2010 reflects the effects of the significant macroeconomic stimulus under way as well as of the measures taken so far to restore the functioning of the financial system both inside and outside the euro area
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9855729937553406;forecasts by international organisations are broadly in line with the june 2009 eurosystem staff projections taking into account the results of the first quarter
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.8720362782478333;in the view of the governing council the risks to the economic outlook are balanced
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9921640157699585;on the positive side there may be stronger than anticipated effects stemming from the extensive macroeconomic stimulus under way and from other policy measures taken
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9856995940208435;confidence may also improve more quickly than currently expected
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9049851894378662;on the other hand concerns remain relating to the following potential factors a stronger impact on the real economy from the turmoil in financial markets more unfavourable developments in labour markets the intensification of protectionist pressures and finally adverse developments in the world economy stemming from a disorderly correction of global imbalances
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9878238439559937;with regard to price developments annual hicp inflation was according to eurostats flash estimate 00 in may compared with 06 in april
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.6901785135269165;as explained on earlier occasions the further decline in inflation rates was fully anticipated and primarily reflects base effects resulting from the sharp swings in global commodity prices over the past 12 months
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9822744131088257;looking ahead owing to these base effects annual inflation rates are projected to decline further and temporarily remain negative over the coming months before returning to positive territory by the end of 2009 such shortterm movements are however not relevant from a monetary policy perspective
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9940592050552368;looking further ahead price and cost developments are expected to remain dampened in the wake of ongoing sluggish demand in the euro area and elsewhere
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9658388495445251;this outlook is consistent with the june 2009 eurosystem staff projections for euro area inflation in which annual hicp inflation is seen to range between 01 and 05 in 2009 revised slightly downwards from the march 2009 ecb staff projections
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9904108047485352;for 2010 eurosystem staff project annual hicp inflation to range between 06 and 14 broadly unchanged from the march 2009 ecb staff projections
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.976006031036377;available forecasts from international organisations provide a similar picture
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9881579279899597;against this background it is again important to stress that the indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the governing councils aim of keeping inflation rates below but close to 2 over the medium term
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9024832248687744;risks to these projections are broadly balanced
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Negative;0.855606198310852;on the downside these risks relate in particular to the outlook for economic activity while on the upside they relate to higher than expected commodity prices
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Positive;0.987246036529541;furthermore increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be stronger than currently expected owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9252707958221436;turning to the monetary analysis the latest data confirm the continued deceleration in the pace of underlying monetary expansion and thus support the assessment of moderate inflationary pressures
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.6653120517730713;in april the annual growth rate of m3 declined further to 49 and that of loans to the private sector to 24
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9916119575500488;however especially with regard to m3 growth the pace of decline in annual growth rates was slower than in previous months reflecting a brisk growth in monetary aggregates in april
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9884534478187561;the latest developments in m3 components continue to reflect to a large extent the impact of past reductions in key ecb interest rates which have led to declines both in the levels of different deposit interest rates and in the spreads between them
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9809097647666931;this has implied for instance lower opportunity costs for market participants to shift funds into highly liquid overnight deposits and explains the strengthening of annual m1 growth to 84 in april
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9672906994819641;at the same time the reduced remuneration of other shortterm deposits and marketable instruments continues to foster the allocation of funds to instruments outside m3
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Negative;0.90580153465271;the outstanding amount of mfi loans to the private sector contracted somewhat further in april
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9935922026634216;this development is again mainly due to a negative flow of shortterm lending to nonfinancial corporations which partly reflects a lower need for working capital in view of the sharp deterioration in economic activity and business prospects during the first few months of the year and greater recourse to liquidity buffers in financing such working capital
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Positive;0.980562686920166;by contrast longerterm lending to nonfinancial corporations remained positive
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9532151818275452;the past reductions in key ecb rates have continued to be passed on to lending rates to both nonfinancial corporations and households
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9921637773513794;the resulting improvement in financing conditions should provide ongoing support for economic activity in the period ahead
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.5995415449142456;however given the challenges which lie ahead banks should take appropriate measures to further strengthen their capital bases and where necessary take full advantage of the government measures to support the financial sector in particular as regards recapitalisation
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9903677701950073;to sum up the current key ecb interest rates are appropriate taking into account our decisions of early may including the enhanced credit support measures and all the information and analyses which have become available since then
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9932441115379333;we confirmed our expectation that price developments over the policyrelevant horizon will remain dampened by the marked weakening of economic activity in the euro area and globally
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9813453555107117;recent survey information indicates that following two quarters of very negative growth economic activity over the remainder of this year is expected to decline at much less negative rates
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Positive;0.8459979891777039;after a stabilisation phase positive quarterly growth rates are expected by mid2010
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Negative;0.8657310009002686;this assessment incorporates adverse lagged effects such as a further deterioration in labour markets which are likely to materialise over the coming months
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9940872192382812;at the same time available indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the governing councils aim of keeping inflation rates below but close to 2 over the medium term
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.7523902058601379;a crosscheck with the outcome of the monetary analysis supports the assessment of moderate inflationary pressure as money and credit growth have further declined on an annual basis
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9178056716918945;against this background we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9638526439666748;as the transmission of monetary policy works with lags our policy action will progressively feed through to the economy in full
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.8121592998504639;hence with all the measures taken monetary policy will provide ongoing support for households and corporations
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.6558050513267517;once the macroeconomic environment improves the governing council will ensure that the measures taken can be quickly unwound and the liquidity provided absorbed
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Negative;0.8430218696594238;hence any threat to price stability over the medium to longer term can be effectively countered in a timely fashion
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9728701710700989;as has been emphasised many times the governing council will continue to ensure a firm anchoring of mediumterm inflation expectations
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9729530811309814;such anchoring is indispensable to supporting sustainable growth and employment and contributes to financial stability
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9682788252830505;accordingly we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Positive;0.5578135848045349;regarding fiscal policies the latest projections by the european commission point to a sharp increase in the euro area general government deficit and debt ratios in 2009 the deficit ratio is projected to rise to 53 of gdp in 2009 and further to 65 in 2010 from 19 in 2008 with the debt ratio exceeding 80 of gdp in 2010 a large majority of euro area countries are expected to exceed the 3 of gdp deficit reference value in 2009 and 2010 to ensure trust in the sustainability of public finances an ambitious and credible adjustment effort will be required to return as soon as possible to sound fiscal positions supported by a full application of the provisions of the stability and growth pact
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9533200263977051;the rapid attainment of sound fiscal positions will be necessary to enable countries to deal with the additional fiscal burden owing to demographic ageing as well as the risks arising from government guarantees that were provided to stabilise financial sectors
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9832820296287537;turning to structural policies there is a strong case for undertaking further efforts to support potential growth in the euro area
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Positive;0.88092440366745;it is crucial that the focus is now on strengthening the adjustment capacity and flexibility of the euro area economy in line with the principle of an open market economy
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9799577593803406;in this respect the current situation can be seen as a catalyst to accelerate the implementation of necessary domestic reforms notably labour market reforms to facilitate appropriate wagesetting and labour mobility across sectors and regions as well as product market reforms to foster competition and speed up restructuring and productivity growth
2009-06-04;2009;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9842685461044312;at the same time many of the policy measures taken in recent months with a view to supporting specific segments of the economy need to be phased out in a timely manner
