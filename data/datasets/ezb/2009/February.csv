2009-02-05;2009;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9419136047363281;allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail starting with the economic analysis
2009-02-05;2009;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9920594692230225;reflecting the impact of the intensified and broadened financial market turmoil economic activity throughout the world including in the euro area has weakened substantially
2009-02-05;2009;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9927443265914917;foreign demand for euro area exports has declined and domestic factors notably very low confidence and tight financing conditions have adversely affected domestic demand
2009-02-05;2009;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8877158164978027;taken together with other available economic data for the euro area this points to very negative quarteronquarter real gdp growth in the last quarter of 2008 this information is in line with our current analysis and forwardlooking assessment
2009-02-05;2009;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9932914972305298;we continue to see persistent weakness in economic activity in the euro area over the coming quarters as the financial market tensions have a further impact on the global and domestic economy
2009-02-05;2009;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9816142320632935;at the same time the very substantial fall in commodity prices seen since the middle of 2008 should support real disposable income and thus consumption in the period ahead
2009-02-05;2009;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.6142439246177673;most recently there have been tentative signs of stabilisation in some survey data albeit at historically low levels
2009-02-05;2009;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9808633327484131;these indications however require confirmation on a broader basis
2009-02-05;2009;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9878345727920532;in the view of the governing council the outlook for the economy remains surrounded by an exceptionally high degree of uncertainty
2009-02-05;2009;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9927172660827637;overall risks to economic growth remain clearly on the downside
2009-02-05;2009;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9805107712745667;they relate mainly to the potential for a stronger impact on the real economy of the turmoil in financial markets as well as to concerns about the emergence and intensification of protectionist pressures and to possible adverse developments in the world economy stemming from a disorderly correction of global imbalances
2009-02-05;2009;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9683727025985718;over time the euro area should reap the benefit of the effects of significant policy measures that have been decided upon over recent months to deal with the financial turmoil
2009-02-05;2009;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9832841157913208;they should help to restore trust in the financial system and to ease constraints on credit supply to companies and households
2009-02-05;2009;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8884250521659851;in order to ensure that such measures effectively support a sustainable recovery it is of the utmost importance that they remain focused and temporary in nature so as to maintain a stabilityoriented and mediumterm perspective in macroeconomic policymaking
2009-02-05;2009;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9899306297302246;with regard to price developments annual hicp inflation continued to decline in january 2009 falling to 11 according to eurostats flash estimate from 16 in december 2008 while no detailed breakdown for hicp developments in january is available as yet the decline in headline inflation observed since the middle of 2008 primarily reflects the sharp falls in global commodity prices over this period owing mainly to weak global demand
2009-02-05;2009;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9697281122207642;looking ahead lower commodity prices and the prospect of weak demand confirm our assessment of midjanuary that inflationary pressures in the euro area are diminishing
2009-02-05;2009;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9398425817489624;owing mainly to base effects stemming from the past behaviour of energy prices headline annual inflation rates are projected to decline further in the coming months possibly reaching very low levels at midyear
2009-02-05;2009;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8807321190834045;however also owing to base effects stemming from past energy price developments inflation rates are expected to increase again in the second half of the year
2009-02-05;2009;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9783669114112854;accordingly it is likely that hicp inflation rates will fluctuate sharply during 2009 such shortterm volatility is however not relevant from a monetary policy perspective
2009-02-05;2009;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9895572066307068;looking over the policyrelevant mediumterm horizon annual hicp inflation is expected to be in line with price stability
2009-02-05;2009;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9868655800819397;this assessment is supported by available indicators of inflation expectations for the medium term
2009-02-05;2009;February;REPORT;Positive;0.5522171854972839;regarding risks to price stability over the medium term unexpected further declines in commodity prices or a stronger than expected slowdown in the economy could put downward pressure on inflation while upside risks to price stability could materialise particularly if the recent fall in commodity prices were to reverse or if domestic price pressures turn out to be stronger than assumed
2009-02-05;2009;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.7403020858764648;it is therefore crucial that price and wagesetters fully live up to their responsibilities
2009-02-05;2009;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9905272722244263;turning to the monetary analysis the latest evidence confirms a continued deceleration in the underlying pace of monetary expansion in the euro area supporting the view that inflationary pressures are diminishing
2009-02-05;2009;February;REPORT;Negative;0.616356611251831;in analysing monetary developments it should be recognised that the intensification and broadening of the financial turmoil since september 2008 has the potential to affect the evolution of monetary aggregates significantly

2009-02-05;2009;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.5679967999458313;both the broad aggregate m3 and in particular the components of m3 that are most closely related to the ongoing financial tensions  such as holdings of money market funds  have shown high monthtomonth volatility of late
2009-02-05;2009;February;REPORT;Negative;0.7863309979438782;overall looking to the extent possible through this volatility the underlying pace of broad money expansion continues to decelerate gradually from the peak seen in early 2007 however the intensification of financial tensions since september 2008 is leading to significant substitution among the components of m3
2009-02-05;2009;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9920084476470947;turning to the evolution of bank credit the flow of mfi loans to the private sector moderated in the course of 2008 largely on account of weakness in loans to households especially for house purchase
2009-02-05;2009;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9872868657112122;in december however outstanding mfi loans to nonfinancial corporations contracted for the first time since the onset of the financial turmoil confirming the significant weakening of corporate credit at the end of the year after a long period of dynamic growth
2009-02-05;2009;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9801623821258545;at the same time the substantial reduction in key ecb interest rates since october 2008 appears to have been passed through to lower bank lending rates thereby easing financing conditions for companies and households
2009-02-05;2009;February;REPORT;Negative;0.991256594657898;moreover there are some indications that the pace of tightening of bank credit standards is stabilising albeit at high levels by historical standards
2009-02-05;2009;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9551724195480347;overall the incoming information on financing conditions requires continuous close monitoring
2009-02-05;2009;February;REPORT;Negative;0.8713921308517456;to sum up as anticipated in our interest rate decision of 15 january 2009 the latest economic data and survey information confirm that the euro area and its major trading partners are undergoing a period of significant economic downturn and that accordingly both external and domestic inflationary pressures are diminishing
2009-02-05;2009;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.978880763053894;we continue to expect inflation rates in the euro area to be in line with price stability over the policyrelevant mediumterm horizon thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households
2009-02-05;2009;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9868655800819397;this assessment is supported by available indicators of inflation expectations for the medium term
2009-02-05;2009;February;REPORT;Negative;0.8415238261222839;it is also confirmed by a crosscheck of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis against the background of a further deceleration in monetary and credit growth in the euro area
2009-02-05;2009;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9930989146232605;fully in line with its primary objective the governing council will continue to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored in accordance with its definition of price stability that is inflation rates of below but close to 2 over the medium term

2009-02-05;2009;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9682788252830505;accordingly we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead
2009-02-05;2009;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9908197522163391;turning to fiscal policy the european commission projects in its january 2009 interim forecast a substantial rise in the average euro area government budget deficit to 40 of gdp this year from 17 in 2008 this rapid deterioration of the fiscal position is broadbased among euro area countries and is due to the economic downturn additional revenue shortfalls and the fiscal stimulus measures adopted by many governments
2009-02-05;2009;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9898844957351685;in 2009 seven euro area countries are currently expected by the commission to exceed the 3 of gdp reference value for the budget deficit
2009-02-05;2009;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8206017017364502;in addition many governments have assumed large contingent liabilities in connection with the guarantees provided to banks and will need to finance the capital injections in support of the financial sector
2009-02-05;2009;February;REPORT;Positive;0.6176590323448181;to support the publics confidence in the sustainability of public finances it is therefore essential that governments return to a credible commitment to mediumterm budgetary objectives as soon as possible
2009-02-05;2009;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.93480384349823;as regards structural policies it is important to continue on the longterm reform path foreseen by the lisbon agenda
2009-02-05;2009;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9744547009468079;at the current juncture it is essential to pursue economic policies in line with the principle of an open market economy with free competition resisting any protectionist pressure
2009-02-05;2009;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9877663850784302;moreover product and services market reforms should foster competition and help to speed up effective restructuring
2009-02-05;2009;February;REPORT;Positive;0.7161284685134888;labour market reforms should help to facilitate appropriate wagesetting as well as labour mobility across sectors and regions
2009-02-05;2009;February;REPORT;Negative;0.8146392703056335;this will be particularly important for those areas and sectors hit strongly by the negative demand shock
2009-02-05;2009;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9174251556396484;in several countries it is also crucial to take measures with a view to addressing competitiveness losses accumulated over recent years
