2009-10-08;2009;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9920585751533508;in particular the euro area should benefit from a recovery in exports the significant macroeconomic stimulus under way and the measures taken to restore the functioning of the financial system

2009-10-08;2009;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.5224247574806213;it will be supported in the short term by a number of temporary factors but is likely to be affected over the medium term by the process of ongoing balance sheet correction in the financial and the nonfinancial sector of the economy both inside and outside the euro area
2009-10-08;2009;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9305509924888611;in the view of the governing council the risks to this outlook remain broadly balanced

2009-10-08;2009;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8868146538734436;the current negative inflation rates are in line with previous expectations and reflect largely base effects resulting from the movements in global commodity prices a year ago

2009-10-08;2009;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9917328357696533;thereafter over the policyrelevant horizon inflation is expected to remain in positive territory with overall price and cost developments staying subdued reflecting ongoing sluggish demand in the euro area and elsewhere
2009-10-08;2009;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9912216663360596;in this context it is important to reemphasise that inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the governing councils aim of keeping inflation rates below but close to 2 over the medium term
2009-10-08;2009;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8692217469215393;risks to this outlook remain broadly balanced

2009-10-08;2009;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.6436417102813721;the strength of m1 reflects the fact that narrower spreads between the rates on different shortterm deposits have fostered shifts in the allocation of funds from in particular shortterm time deposits to overnight deposits
2009-10-08;2009;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9875734448432922;at the same time the steep slope of the yield curve may have supported shifts from m3 to longerterm deposits and securities outside m3

2009-10-08;2009;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9743027091026306;this is in line with the lag that normally prevails between trends in economic activity and developments in loans to enterprises
2009-10-08;2009;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9950537085533142;in this respect given the subdued levels of production and trade as well as the ongoing uncertainty with regard to the business outlook further weak developments in loans to nonfinancial corporations in the coming months appear likely
2009-10-08;2009;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9921442270278931;at the same time the ongoing improvement in financing conditions should support the demand for credit in the period ahead

2009-10-08;2009;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.6668809652328491;once the macroeconomic environment improves the governing council will make sure that the measures taken are unwound in a timely fashion and that the liquidity provided is absorbed in order to counter effectively any threat to price stability over the medium to longer term
2009-10-08;2009;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9764377474784851;by so doing the governing council will continue to ensure a firm anchoring of mediumterm inflation expectations
2009-10-08;2009;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9776480197906494;such anchoring is indispensable to supporting sustainable growth and employment and contributing to financial stability

2009-10-08;2009;October;REPORT;Positive;0.6711791753768921;these plans should also be accompanied by a strengthening of national budgetary frameworks
2009-10-08;2009;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.4994327425956726;consolidation efforts should be stepped up in 2011 and will need to exceed significantly the benchmark of 05 of gdp per annum set in the stability and growth pact
2009-10-08;2009;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.983908474445343;in countries with high deficit andor debt ratios the annual structural adjustment should reach at least 1 of gdp
2009-10-08;2009;October;REPORT;Negative;0.5812046527862549;in view of the rapidly increasing public expenditure ratios as well as projected further expenditure pressures owing to higher interest burdens and ageingrelated costs countries structural measures should focus on the expenditure side
