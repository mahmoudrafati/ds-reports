2005-03-03;2005;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9701924324035645;on the whole we continue to see no significant evidence of underlying domestic inflationary pressures building up in the euro area
2005-03-03;2005;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9881485104560852;accordingly we have left the key ecb interest rates unchanged
2005-03-03;2005;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9826751947402954;these interest rates are at historically low levels and are making an important contribution to the economic recovery
2005-03-03;2005;March;REPORT;Negative;0.892137348651886;at the same time upside risks to price stability over the medium term exist
2005-03-03;2005;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8745336532592773;these require continued vigilance on the part of the governing council
2005-03-03;2005;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9345163106918335;i shall now explain our assessment in more detail turning first to the economic analysis
2005-03-03;2005;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8150371313095093;according to eurostats flash estimate real gdp in the euro area grew at a quarteronquarter rate of 02 in the fourth quarter of 2004 in addition thirdquarter real gdp growth was revised down to 02
2005-03-03;2005;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9922389984130859;this overall outcome for the second half of last year was disappointing
2005-03-03;2005;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9919792413711548;however the composition of demand growth in the fourth quarter also offered some positive signs with regard to the underlying trend
2005-03-03;2005;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9815281629562378;the strengthening of domestic demand and in particular consumption may point to the recovery in economic activity in the euro area regaining some momentum
2005-03-03;2005;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9940081834793091;there are a number of reasons why the weaker real gdp growth in the second half of 2004 could be a transitory phenomenon
2005-03-03;2005;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9922532439231873;on the external side growth in the world economy remains strong supporting euro area exports
2005-03-03;2005;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9922838807106018;on the domestic side investment is expected to continue to benefit from very favourable financing conditions robust earnings and greater business efficiency
2005-03-03;2005;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9914608001708984;consumption growth should benefit from anticipated developments in real disposable income
2005-03-03;2005;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9811644554138184;accordingly we expect continued economic growth in 2005 and 2006 this assessment is also reflected in the new ecb staff projections which will be published today
2005-03-03;2005;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9844236969947815;euro area real gdp growth is projected by the ecbs staff to be on average between 12 and 20 in 2005 and between 16 and 26 in 2006 these projections are lower than those published in december 2004 reflecting the weaker economic developments in late 2004 available forecasts from international and private sector organisations convey a broadly similar outlook
2005-03-03;2005;March;REPORT;Negative;0.7283541560173035;the picture emerging from the projections contains a number of risks
2005-03-03;2005;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9852777123451233;on the external side high and volatile oil prices and persistent global imbalances pose downside risks to growth
2005-03-03;2005;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9789673686027527;as regards exchange rates we confirm our position  expressed when the euro rose sharply  that such moves are unwelcome and undesirable for economic growth
2005-03-03;2005;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9853876233100891;on the domestic side there are uncertainties surrounding the evolution of consumption while the very favourable financing conditions and the recovery in corporate earnings could lead to higher investment growth than currently projected
2005-03-03;2005;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.970146119594574;turning to consumer prices annual hicp inflation declined quite substantially in january 2005 falling to 19 from 24 in december 2004 this was largely a result of base effects from developments in indirect taxes and administered prices in some countries
2005-03-03;2005;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.984122633934021;in february according to eurostats flash estimate annual hicp inflation was 20
2005-03-03;2005;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9831982254981995;in the coming months annual inflation rates are likely to fluctuate around 2
2005-03-03;2005;March;REPORT;Positive;0.7296997308731079;looking further ahead there is no evidence that stronger underlying domestic inflationary pressures are building up in the euro area
2005-03-03;2005;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9768950939178467;over recent quarters wage increases have remained moderate
2005-03-03;2005;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9139151573181152;in the context of moderate economic growth this trend should continue
2005-03-03;2005;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9843007922172546;these views are also embodied in the ecb staff projections
2005-03-03;2005;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9921438694000244;average annual hicp inflation is projected by the staff to lie between 16 and 22 in 2005 and between 10 and 22 in 2006 these projections are broadly unchanged from the eurosystem staff projections published in december 2004 and consistent with forecasts recently released by international and private sector organisations
2005-03-03;2005;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.560289740562439;several upside risks to these projections need to be taken into account notably future oil price developments
2005-03-03;2005;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9801071882247925;developments in indirect taxes and administered prices may also again surprise on the upside
2005-03-03;2005;March;REPORT;Negative;0.797885000705719;furthermore continued vigilance is required regarding the potential risk of past price increases leading to secondround effects in wage and pricesetting throughout the economy
2005-03-03;2005;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9747453927993774;in this respect developments in longerterm inflation expectations need to be monitored closely
2005-03-03;2005;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9599506855010986;further insight into the outlook for price developments at medium to longerterm horizons is provided by the monetary analysis
2005-03-03;2005;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9732969403266907;the latest monetary data confirm the strengthening of m3 growth observed since mid2004
2005-03-03;2005;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.5124083757400513;this increasingly reflects the stimulative effect of the historically very low level of interest rates in the euro area
2005-03-03;2005;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9596284031867981;as a result of the persistently strong growth in m3 over the past few years substantially more liquidity in the euro area exists than is needed to finance noninflationary economic growth
2005-03-03;2005;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9783498048782349;this could pose risks to price stability over the medium term and warrants vigilance
2005-03-03;2005;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9352187514305115;the exceptionally low level of real interest rates is also further stimulating private sector demand for credit
2005-03-03;2005;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8296127915382385;growth in loans to nonfinancial corporations has continued to pick up in recent months
2005-03-03;2005;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9927615523338318;moreover demand for loans for house purchase has continued to be robust contributing to strong house price dynamics in some regions of the euro area
2005-03-03;2005;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9841173887252808;to sum up the economic analysis confirms that underlying domestic inflationary pressures remain contained while mediumterm upside risks to price stability exist and will be monitored closely
2005-03-03;2005;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.5996671915054321;crosschecking with the monetary analysis supports the case for continued vigilance with regard to the materialisation of risks to price stability over the medium term
2005-03-03;2005;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.695097029209137;turning to fiscal policies the governing council notes that while some progress with fiscal consolidation and the correction of excessive deficits is envisaged in euro area countries updated stability programmes further consolidation in a number of countries is needed
2005-03-03;2005;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9567441940307617;in particular several countries do not plan to pursue an appropriately ambitious adjustment path and are not targeting closetobalance or insurplus budgetary positions by the end of the programme horizon
2005-03-03;2005;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9251373410224915;in addition in some cases fiscal targets are based on rather favourable growth assumptions and on insufficiently specified measures
2005-03-03;2005;March;REPORT;Negative;0.8133899569511414;with respect to the stability and growth pact discussions now need to be brought to a convincing conclusion with an outcome that safeguards fiscal discipline
2005-03-03;2005;March;REPORT;Negative;0.5841581225395203;the credibility of the excessive deficit procedure needs to be fully preserved
2005-03-03;2005;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8644763827323914;this is not only fundamental for macroeconomic stability and cohesion in the euro area but also for confidence and growth prospects in all member states
2005-03-03;2005;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9849580526351929;in this regard the governing council welcomes the decision by the ecofin council based on a recommendation by the european commission to move for the first time to the next procedural step in the excessive deficit procedure and to give notice in accordance with treaty article 1049 to greece
2005-03-03;2005;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9749920964241028;the governing council also takes the view that the extension of the deadline from 2005 to 2006 for correcting the excessive deficit pushes the room for interpretation of the rules and procedures to the limit
2005-03-03;2005;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.925568699836731;it is now indispensable for greece to take effective action to correct its severe fiscal imbalances
2005-03-03;2005;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9909384250640869;as regards structural developments the euro area has seen relatively low trend productivity growth since the mid1990s
2005-03-03;2005;March;REPORT;Negative;0.8234689235687256;an analysis of the determinants of productivity shows that lower productivity growth in the euro area has been partly related to higher employment due to greater participation of lowerskilled labour
2005-03-03;2005;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9402917623519897;sustained wage moderation and some progress in labour market reforms aimed at increasing labour market participation appear to have partially shifted production towards a more intensive use of labour
2005-03-03;2005;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9921686053276062;there are also indications that the slower pace of productivity growth observed in the euro area since the mid1990s reflects an insufficient use of new productivityenhancing technologies
2005-03-03;2005;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9952324032783508;while productivity growth has increased in sectors that produce information and communication technologies or provide related services it has declined in many other areas of the economy
2005-03-03;2005;March;REPORT;Negative;0.716073751449585;this points to structural rigidities in the euro area that prevent or hinder the fast and effective dissemination of new technologies and improved production processes across the economy
2005-03-03;2005;March;REPORT;Positive;0.8404507040977478;against this background structural reforms that stimulate innovation investment and productivity and promote the use of new productivityenhancing technologies are crucial
2005-03-03;2005;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9842298626899719;stimulating product market competition facilitating restructuring and improving human capital through adequate educational systems and onthejob training are likely to speed up productivity gains from the use of new technologies
