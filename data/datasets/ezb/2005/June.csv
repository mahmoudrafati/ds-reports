2005-06-02;2005;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.981977641582489;however figures for real gdp growth over the last two quarters partly reflect statistical effects related to workingday adjustments to the data
2005-06-02;2005;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9868876338005066;this has led to some understatement of growth dynamics in the last quarter of 2004 and to some overstatement in the first quarter of 2005 most recent indicators for economic activity remain on balance on the downside the moderation in economic activity observed since mid2004 is partly related to the rise in oil prices
2005-06-02;2005;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9866495728492737;looking ahead there is scope for positive fundamental factors to again shape the outlook assuming that the effects from adverse developments gradually diminish

2005-06-02;2005;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9855505228042603;in 2006 this largely reflects the expected statistical effect of a planned health care reform in one euro area country the netherlands which is estimated to imply a oneoff reduction of 02 percentage point in the euro area inflation rate for 2006 this effect should be excluded from the assessment of the mediumterm outlook for price stability
2005-06-02;2005;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9862922430038452;taking into account the assumptions underlying the projections upside risks to the inflation projections prevail
