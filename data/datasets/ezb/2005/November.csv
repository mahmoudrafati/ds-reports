2005-11-03;2005;November;REPORT;Negative;0.8802796006202698;at the same time strong vigilance with regard to the upside risks to price stability is warranted
2005-11-03;2005;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9906238913536072;strong vigilance is also called for in the light of ample liquidity and buoyant monetary and credit growth in the euro area
2005-11-03;2005;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9513093829154968;it is of the essence that the increase in current inflation rates does not translate into inflationary pressures over the medium term and to ensure that inflation expectations remain firmly anchored at levels consistent with price stability
2005-11-03;2005;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9806533455848694;across the maturity spectrum interest rates in the euro area remain very low in both nominal and real terms and the current very accommodative stance of monetary policy lends considerable support to economic activity
2005-11-03;2005;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9419136047363281;allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail starting with the economic analysis
2005-11-03;2005;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9882732033729553;although economic growth has been dampened by the marked increase in oil prices over recent quarters it appears that the euro area economy has shown considerable resilience to this shock supported also by responsible wagenegotiating behaviour

2005-11-03;2005;November;REPORT;Positive;0.6696693301200867;this would be in line with the september ecb staff projections which indicate a gradual recovery from the second half of 2005 onwards
2005-11-03;2005;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9918599724769592;on the external side it is projected that ongoing growth in global demand will support euro area exports and on the domestic side that investment will benefit from continued favourable financing conditions as well as from the robust growth of corporate earnings
2005-11-03;2005;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9330142736434937;consumption should gradually recover broadly in line with expected developments in real disposable income
2005-11-03;2005;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9924539923667908;at the same time the outlook for economic activity remains subject to downward risks relating mainly to oil prices concerns about global imbalances and weak consumer confidence
2005-11-03;2005;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8729134202003479;turning to price developments recent increases in mainly energy prices have pushed headline inflation rates to levels significantly in excess of 2
2005-11-03;2005;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.991814911365509;according to eurostats flash estimate annual hicp inflation was 25 in october 2005 compared with 26 in september and 22 in the two preceding months
2005-11-03;2005;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9623671770095825;it is likely that hicp inflation will remain elevated in the short term
2005-11-03;2005;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9883238077163696;as we stressed in october it is key in interpreting current inflation rates to make a clear distinction between temporary shortterm factors on the one hand and those of a more lasting nature on the other
2005-11-03;2005;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9906141757965088;while some developments might prove to be transitory markets expect oil prices to remain at high levels driven mainly by buoyant global demand and to some extent by fragilities on the supply side
2005-11-03;2005;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9119623303413391;this suggests a more lasting impact of energy prices on overall price developments
2005-11-03;2005;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9777281284332275;this assumption underlies our forwardlooking assessment of price developments
2005-11-03;2005;November;REPORT;Negative;0.5446550250053406;at the same time wage increases have remained contained over recent quarters and with labour markets weak this should continue for the time being

2005-11-03;2005;November;REPORT;Negative;0.8559460639953613;all in all while inflation rates are expected to stay above 2 over the shorter term there continues to be no clear evidence yet of domestic inflationary pressures building up in the euro area
2005-11-03;2005;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9920274615287781;we remain however concerned about the mediumterm upside risks to this scenario
2005-11-03;2005;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9283239245414734;as we stressed a month ago these relate to ongoing uncertainties surrounding oil market developments to a potentially stronger passthrough than has so far been observed on account of higher oil prices being passed on to consumers via the domestic production chain and to potential secondround effects in wage and pricesetting behaviour
2005-11-03;2005;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9769623279571533;in addition possible further increases in administered prices and indirect taxes have to be taken into account
2005-11-03;2005;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9530414342880249;hence strong vigilance is required to ensure that medium and longterm inflation expectations for the euro area remain wellanchored
2005-11-03;2005;November;REPORT;Negative;0.4377072751522064;the monetary analysis also points to increased upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term

2005-11-03;2005;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9774110913276672;in this context price dynamics in a number of housing markets need to be monitored closely
2005-11-03;2005;November;REPORT;Positive;0.8089118599891663;to sum up the economic analysis indicates that energy price increases in particular imply upward revisions to the outlook for shortterm price developments
2005-11-03;2005;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9398078918457031;some of the contributing factors can be expected to be temporary but others are likely to be more lasting
2005-11-03;2005;November;REPORT;Positive;0.6276178359985352;domestic inflationary pressures over the medium term still remain contained in the euro area but significant upside risks have to be taken into account
2005-11-03;2005;November;REPORT;Negative;0.8012036681175232;moreover the monetary analysis identifies increased risks to price stability over the medium to longer term
2005-11-03;2005;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9857144951820374;overall crosschecking the information from the two pillars confirms that strong vigilance is warranted to keep inflation expectations in line with price stability
2005-11-03;2005;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9854593276977539;only by keeping medium and longterm inflation expectations firmly anchored at levels consistent with price stability can monetary policy make a significant ongoing contribution towards a recovery in economic growth
2005-11-03;2005;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9892599582672119;as regards fiscal policies a number of countries have presented their 2006 budget plans
2005-11-03;2005;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9935147762298584;despite some welcome progress with fiscal consolidation the outlook for countries in excessive deficit is a matter of great concern as there is a risk of consolidation not proceeding and commitments for this year and next not being met
2005-11-03;2005;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9782957434654236;further delays in the correction of excessive deficits and a continued inclination to look for the most lenient way to implement the procedural steps of the revised stability and growth pact risk undermining the pacts credibility
2005-11-03;2005;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.7561829090118408;this must be avoided

2005-11-03;2005;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9774639010429382;we therefore urge countries with fiscal imbalances to give priority to their timely correction and to implement the revised pact rigorously
2005-11-03;2005;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8645104765892029;this will send the right signal to the public and support the credibility of the fiscal framework
2005-11-03;2005;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.4472784101963043;as regards structural reforms we stress again the urgent need to increase the flexibility of labour and product markets in order to achieve a more dynamic and competitive european economy and to help foster the adjustment processes within the euro area
