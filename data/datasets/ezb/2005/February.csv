2005-02-03;2005;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9920030832290649;on the domestic side reducing uncertainties associated with the extent and pace of fiscal and structural reforms would support consumption as such uncertainties seem to be limiting private sector expectations of future real disposable income growth

2005-02-03;2005;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.5124083757400513;this increasingly reflects the stimulative effect of the historically very low level of interest rates in the euro area
2005-02-03;2005;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9411493539810181;as a result of the persistently strong growth in m3 over the past few years there remains substantially more liquidity in the euro area than is needed to finance noninflationary economic growth

2005-02-03;2005;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8283611536026001;it is important that higher inflation in the short term does not become entrenched in longterm inflation expectations and wage and pricesetting behaviour
2005-02-03;2005;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.5996671915054321;crosschecking with the monetary analysis supports the case for continued vigilance with regard to the materialisation of risks to price stability over the medium term
