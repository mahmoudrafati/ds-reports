2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.987667977809906;the governing council has today met for the 12th time outside frankfurt meaning that it has now met once in each of the euro area member countries
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Positive;0.6516140103340149;i would particularly like to thank governor garganas for his kind hospitality and express our special gratitude to the staff of the bank of greece for the perfect organisation
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9576860666275024;let me now report on the outcome of todays meeting which was also attended by the president of the eurogroup prime minister juncker and commissioner almunia
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9600404500961304;on the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses despite renewed upward pressure on prices stemming mainly from oil market developments we have concluded that the monetary policy stance still remains appropriate
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.98616623878479;accordingly we have decided to leave the key ecb interest rates unchanged
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Negative;0.8887298107147217;at the same time strong vigilance with regard to upside risks to price stability is warranted
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9716747403144836;it is essential that the increase in the current inflation rate does not translate into higher underlying inflationary pressures in the euro area
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9850122928619385;strong vigilance is also called for in the light of ample liquidity in the euro area
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9783194661140442;across the maturity spectrum interest rates in the euro area remain very low in both nominal and real terms and thus lend ongoing support to economic activity
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Positive;0.6350558996200562;for this support to continue it is of the essence that inflation expectations remain firmly anchored at levels consistent with price stability
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9419136047363281;allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail starting with the economic analysis
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9940985441207886;real gdp has been growing at a quarteronquarter rate of 04 and 03 over the first two quarters of 2005 dampened in particular by higher oil prices
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Positive;0.8532161712646484;in line with our staff projections recent survey indicators on balance support the view that economic growth could gradually pick up from the second half of this year onwards
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9914974570274353;on the external side ongoing growth in global demand should support euro area exports
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9921512603759766;on the domestic side investment should benefit both from continuously favourable financing conditions and from the robust growth of corporate earnings
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9330142736434937;consumption should gradually recover broadly in line with expected developments in real disposable income
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9926470518112183;this outlook for economic activity remains subject to downward risks relating mainly to oil prices concerns about global imbalances and weak consumer confidence
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9840143322944641;temporarily further uncertainty arose as to the economic effects of the recent hurricanes in the united states which assessments in the meantime have generally suggested to be limited and shortterm
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8703618049621582;turning to price developments recent increases mainly in oil prices have pushed headline inflation rates to levels significantly in excess of 2
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Negative;0.8436741232872009;according to eurostats flash estimate annual hicp inflation was 25 in september compared with 22 in the previous two months and it is likely that hicp inflation will remain elevated in the short term
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.986778974533081;in interpreting this jump in the annual inflation rate it is key to make a clear distinction between temporary shortterm factors on the one hand and those of a more lasting nature on the other
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9860903024673462;while no detailed information on developments in the components of hicp in september is available as yet it appears that oil price increases have again played an important role this time exacerbated by a much stronger increase in petrol prices owing to exceptional capacity constraints at refineries following the two hurricanes in the united states
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Negative;0.7361654043197632;if a gradual normalisation in this market segment is confirmed an unwinding of the sharp increases in spreads between oil prices and refined products could materialise
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9012250304222107;hence these increases may be only temporary
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9333146810531616;however there is currently no indication that oil prices will moderate significantly in the foreseeable future
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9899661540985107;rather markets expect oil prices to remain at high levels driven mainly by buoyant global demand and to some extent by fragilities on the supply side
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9816022515296936;accordingly this scenario underlies our forwardlooking assessment of price developments
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.7778822183609009;crucially what matters is how these developments affect the outlook for price stability over the medium term
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9344384074211121;for the time being there continues to be no clear evidence of domestic inflationary pressures building up in the euro area
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9410783648490906;in particular wage increases have remained contained over recent quarters and with labour markets weak this should continue for the time being
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9571079611778259;our main scenario therefore remains one of elevated inflation rates over the short term with a gradual decline thereafter
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Negative;0.8205065727233887;upside risks to this scenario have however increased
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Positive;0.4656275510787964;these relate to ongoing uncertainties surrounding oil market developments to a potentially stronger passthrough than has so far been observed on account of higher oil prices being passed on to consumers via the domestic production chain and to potential secondround effects in wage and pricesetting behaviour all of which play an important role in our assessment for price stability over the medium term
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9769623279571533;in addition possible further increases in administered prices and indirect taxes have to be taken into account
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9454814195632935;accordingly strong vigilance is required in order to ensure that longerterm inflation expectations for the euro area remain wellanchored
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9728886485099792;the monetary analysis provides further insight into inflation prospects over medium to longer horizons
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Positive;0.986170768737793;money and credit have continued to grow robustly in the euro area over the past few months with the annual rate of m3 growth now exceeding 8
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9799598455429077;the strength of monetary growth has been increasingly driven primarily by the prevailing low level of interest rates
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Positive;0.990994393825531;in recent months the shortterm dynamics of m3 have gained further momentum and the growth of borrowing in particular mortgage loans remains very strong
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9774110913276672;in this context price dynamics in a number of housing markets need to be monitored closely
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9684029817581177;strong monetary and credit growth in the context of an already ample liquidity situation in the euro area points to risks to price stability over medium to longer horizons
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Positive;0.7416324019432068;to sum up the economic analysis indicates that oil and petrol price increases in particular imply upward revisions to the outlook for shortterm price developments
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9813669323921204;some of these increases can be expected to be of a temporary nature while others are likely to be more lasting
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Positive;0.6276178359985352;domestic inflationary pressures over the medium term still remain contained in the euro area but significant upside risks have to be taken into account
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8474776744842529;moreover the monetary analysis identifies upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9459372162818909;overall crosschecking the information from the two pillars confirms the need for strong vigilance in order to maintain inflation expectations in line with price stability
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9909802079200745;by keeping mediumterm inflation expectations firmly anchored at levels consistent with price stability monetary policy is making a significant ongoing contribution towards a recovery in economic growth
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Negative;0.6321232318878174;as regards fiscal policies in the euro area most recent information continues to provide a very mixed picture
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9199160933494568;some countries report significant imbalances while others continue to maintain sound fiscal positions
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9895045757293701;preparations for 2006 budgets are in their final stages in most euro area countries
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9740855097770691;it is essential that forthcoming budgets reflect the need for fiscal consolidation that both progresses at the appropriate pace and is embedded in a welldesigned and comprehensive reform strategy
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9877215027809143;this would help to support confidence within the euro area by strengthening expectations of sustainable and growthfriendly public finances and by enhancing the credibility of the reformed stability and growth pact
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9566644430160522;as for the impact of high oil prices on public finances consolidation of budgets must be continued
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Negative;0.8285987973213196;let me also recall the latest g7 statement which affirms that subsidies and artificial price caps that constrain the price of oil and oil products have an adverse effect on the global market and should be avoided
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9903818964958191;in the context of its regular discussions about structural reform issues the governing council focused on unit labour cost ulc developments within the euro area which play an important role in determining inflation and competitiveness patterns across the euro area countries
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9193827509880066;since the inception of emu several euro area countries have experienced significantly larger cumulative increases in their ulcs than the euro area average
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9629520773887634;on the other hand some countries have exhibited cumulative ulc developments significantly below the euro area average
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9820924997329712;it must be understood that some differences in ulc growth rates are a natural feature of a wellfunctioning monetary union as these may reflect catchingup processes or necessary adjustments to past shocks
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Negative;0.87785404920578;in this respect the flexibility within the euro area may well have been underestimated in its early phase of existence
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8095041513442993;at the same time there is no room for complacency
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Negative;0.6400722861289978;in some euro area countries wage developments have substantially and persistently exceeded labour productivity growth leading to relatively strong ulc developments over a prolonged period of time higher inflationary pressures and losses in competitiveness
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Negative;0.988899827003479;this may be at least partially due to wage rigidities such as an explicit or de facto indexation of nominal wages to prices or high reservation wages determined by the level of unemployment benefits and to a lack of competition in some sectors
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Negative;0.5953286290168762;in the context of external shocks such as sharp increases in oil prices there is an even greater need for speedingup structural reforms
2005-10-06;2005;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9860709309577942;together with the completion of the eu internal market such reforms would support ulc developments that are conducive to price stability and would further smooth the functioning of adjustment mechanisms in the euro area thereby strengthening the foundations for sustained growth in output and employment
