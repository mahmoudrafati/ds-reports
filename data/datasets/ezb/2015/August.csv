2015-08-13;2015;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9676879048347473;despite recent financial market developments and notwithstanding transmission lags the latest information remained consistent with a continued passthrough of the monetary policy measures to the cost and availability of credit for firms and households
2015-08-13;2015;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9033863544464111;this was seen to be reflected in the latest bank lending survey results which had indicated an overall net easing in credit conditions and suggested that the additional liquidity from the tltros was being used for granting loans
2015-08-13;2015;August;REPORT;Negative;0.5125759840011597;nonetheless there was no reason for complacency not least as risks and vulnerabilities remained in particular related to geopolitical factors the programme negotiations with greece and the growth prospects in emerging markets including china
2015-08-13;2015;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9935006499290466;the present degree of monetary accommodation needed to remain in place as the overall recovery in growth and inflation remained modest and in any case was conditional on the full implementation of all the monetary policy measures taken by the governing council
2015-08-13;2015;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9927874207496643;against this background members generally agreed that a steady course remained warranted as current conditions did not call for any change in the monetary policy stance
2015-08-13;2015;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9866569638252258;this included leaving the key ecb interest rates unchanged in line with the governing councils forward guidance and firmly implementing the nonstandard monetary policy measures already decided
2015-08-13;2015;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9930017590522766;in particular asset purchases should proceed at a monthly pace of 60 billion until endseptember 2016 and in any case until a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation was visible in line with the governing councils aim of achieving inflation rates below but close to 2 over the medium term
2015-08-13;2015;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9517872929573059;at the same time as anticipated with some modest frontloading of purchases since may seasonal patterns in market activity needed to be taken into account to accommodate the reduced depth and liquidity of markets over the summer and winter periods as indicated by mr cœuré in his introduction
2015-08-13;2015;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.7691375017166138;moreover while recent market volatility had not materially changed the assessment of the economic outlook continued elevated uncertainty called for alertness and a readiness to respond if necessary
2015-08-13;2015;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9772157669067383;therefore it appeared warranted to continue to closely monitor the situation in financial markets with a view to potential implications for the monetary policy stance and for the outlook for price stability
2015-08-13;2015;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9890605211257935;this included in particular ensuring that expectations of future shortterm money market rates remained consistent with the governing councils forward guidance
2015-08-13;2015;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.641857385635376;more generally broader financing conditions for households and firms had to be monitored to ensure that they did not change in directions that could endanger the recovery and hamper the normalisation of inflation trends
2015-08-13;2015;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9462904930114746;attention also needed to be paid to possible changes in commodity prices to the slowdown in emerging markets and to exchange rate developments to the extent that they could affect the mediumterm outlook for price stability
2015-08-13;2015;August;REPORT;Negative;0.7659850716590881;there was general agreement among members on the need to respond to an unwarranted tightening of the monetary policy stance or a material change in the mediumterm outlook for price stability

2015-08-13;2015;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9612271189689636;in this context members also reaffirmed as on previous occasions that the design of the asset purchase programmes provided sufficient flexibility for them to be adapted if circumstances were to change and should the need arise
2015-08-13;2015;August;REPORT;Positive;0.5997021794319153;as regards communication it was highlighted that the macroeconomic environment had so far proved resilient to the recent heightened uncertainty and market volatility
2015-08-13;2015;August;REPORT;Positive;0.6125968098640442;the baseline outlook remained intact and the latest agreement to commence negotiations on a new macroeconomic adjustment programme for greece had significantly reduced possible downside risks
2015-08-13;2015;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9920288920402527;while the monetary policy stance therefore remained fully appropriate the present situation remained challenging and subject to downside risks
2015-08-13;2015;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9836646914482117;accordingly the confirmation of a steady monetary policy course needed to be complemented by communicating the governing councils willingness to respond if needed

2015-08-13;2015;August;REPORT;Positive;0.691360354423523;this entailed reaffirming that the full implementation of all adopted monetary policy measures was needed to provide the necessary support to the economic recovery in the euro area to achieve a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels below but close to 2 in the medium term and to underpin a firm anchoring of medium to longterm inflation expectations
2015-08-13;2015;August;REPORT;Negative;0.6313832402229309;at the same time this also entailed the need for a close monitoring of the situation in financial markets with a view to their implications for price stability and a readiness to respond to an unwarranted tightening of the monetary policy stance or a change in the mediumterm outlook for price stability
2015-08-13;2015;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9921846985816956;taking into account the foregoing and on a proposal from the president the governing council decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility would remain unchanged at 005 030 and 020 respectively
