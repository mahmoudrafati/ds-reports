2015-09-03;2015;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9434161186218262;as usual let me start with the decisions taken
2015-09-03;2015;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9887959957122803;based on our regular economic and monetary analysis and in line with our forward guidance the governing council decided to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged

2015-09-03;2015;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9813501834869385;regarding nonstandard monetary policy measures following the announced review of the public sector purchase programmes issue share limit after the first six months of purchases the governing council decided to increase the issue share limit from the initial limit of 25 to 33 subject to a casebycase verification that this would not create a situation whereby the eurosystem would have blocking minority power in which case the issue share limit would remain at 25
2015-09-03;2015;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9848163723945618;underlying our monetary policy assessment was a review of recent data new staff macroeconomic projections and an interim evaluation of recent market fluctuations
2015-09-03;2015;September;REPORT;Negative;0.8797698616981506;the information available indicates a continued though somewhat weaker economic recovery and a slower increase in inflation rates compared with earlier expectations
2015-09-03;2015;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9880080223083496;more recently renewed downside risks have emerged to the outlook for growth and inflation
2015-09-03;2015;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.775048017501831;however owing to sharp fluctuations in financial and commodity markets the governing council judged it premature to conclude on whether these developments could have a lasting impact on the outlook for prices and on the achievement of a sustainable path of inflation towards our mediumterm aim or whether they should be considered to be mainly transitory
2015-09-03;2015;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9847949147224426;accordingly the governing council will closely monitor all relevant incoming information
2015-09-03;2015;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.4954812228679657;it emphasises its willingness and ability to act if warranted by using all the instruments available within its mandate and in particular recalls that the asset purchase programme provides sufficient flexibility in terms of adjusting the size composition and duration of the programme

2015-09-03;2015;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9620970487594604;let me now explain our assessment of the available information in greater detail starting with the economic analysis

2015-09-03;2015;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9845733046531677;overall we expect the economic recovery to continue albeit at a somewhat weaker pace than earlier expected reflecting in particular the slowdown in emerging market economies which is weighing on global growth and foreign demand for euro area exports
2015-09-03;2015;September;REPORT;Positive;0.976251482963562;domestic demand should be further supported by our monetary policy measures and their favourable impact on financial conditions as well as by the progress made with fiscal consolidation and structural reforms
