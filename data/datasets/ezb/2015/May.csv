2015-05-21;2015;May;REPORT;Positive;0.8275494575500488;several comments were made on the relationship between the nonstandard monetary policy measures adopted by the governing council and the outlook for economic activity with broad agreement prevailing that these measures played an important role in supporting economic growth by lowering borrowing costs by working through confidence and financial channels and via the impact on exchange rates
2015-05-21;2015;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9642452597618103;looking ahead members recalled that a sustained pickup in growth as had been projected in the march 2015 ecb staff macroeconomic projections was predicated on the full implementation of all the monetary policy measures in place

2015-05-21;2015;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9929183125495911;members emphasised that the risk of insufficient reform progress was particularly pronounced with regard to structural policies which were hampered by resistance to change

2015-05-21;2015;May;REPORT;Negative;0.6262844204902649;measures to enhance potential output growth were considered essential not least in view of the declining workingage population in the euro area and the ensuing funding difficulties for pension systems which could only be addressed through determined measures to lift total factor productivity
2015-05-21;2015;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9763244390487671;furthermore a lack of structural reforms could dampen not only potential growth but also actual economic growth in the euro area
2015-05-21;2015;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9456610083580017;in that context it was recalled that while the longterm demand effects of structural reforms were undisputedly positive and should be seen as the main motivation for such reforms the shortterm effects were less clear and largely depended on the nature of the policy measures taken
2015-05-21;2015;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9679046273231506;for instance while reforms of judicial systems would most likely yield immediate benefits this was less obvious in the case of labour market reforms as increased flexibility in labour markets could initially depress demand a point that had been underlined in work undertaken by the oecd
2015-05-21;2015;May;REPORT;Positive;0.950983464717865;at the same time it was argued that labour and product market reforms could have a positive shortrun effect on demand as expectations of rising permanent income could help bring forward both investment and consumption demand and higher potential output could reduce concerns about debt sustainability thereby generating fiscal space and mitigating the incentive for consumers to save in anticipation of future tax liabilities
2015-05-21;2015;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9687498211860657;overall it was seen as important to prioritise those structural reforms with a frontloaded positive impact on growth

2015-05-21;2015;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9902030229568481;in addition there was some risk that the lower bound to monetary policy rates could be invoked as an excuse to delay structural reforms in an environment of low inflation
2015-05-21;2015;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9876655340194702;some recent academic literature suggested that structural reforms could be contractionary when interest rates were at the zero lower bound as they could reduce inflation raise real interest rates and thus depress domestic demand
2015-05-21;2015;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9100967049598694;however these research findings were explicitly predicated on the absence of an appropriate monetary stimulus and were hence not currently applicable to the euro area following the nonstandard monetary policy measures put in place by the governing council which provided additional monetary accommodation supporting inflation expectations and low real interest rates
2015-05-21;2015;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9352325797080994;turning to fiscal policy it was recalled that fiscal discipline remained essential in view of the high public debt levels and the need to recreate fiscal space as a buffer for future shocks
