2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9937332272529602;looking ahead inflation rates were expected to pick up during 2016 and 2017 but the overall outlook had deteriorated somewhat according to a mechanical update of the september 2015 ecb staff projections
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9943143725395203;downside risks to the outlook for inflation were generally considered to have remained high with concerns expressed that the prolonged period of low inflation could last longer than previously anticipated
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9861267805099487;as regards the mediumterm outlook for prices members broadly concurred that euro area inflation continued to be expected to increase towards levels below but close to 2 over the medium term albeit at a slower pace than previously anticipated
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9655743837356567;in particular lower energy prices and recent exchange rate developments if not reversed suggested a further downward revision to the inflation outlook
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Negative;0.992183268070221;such a downward revision to the inflation outlook was seen as potentially worrisome especially when coupled with less robust evidence of a sustained turning point in underlying inflation as it would imply a further extension of the protracted period of low inflation and a further postponement of the return of inflation to levels in line with the ecbs mediumterm inflation aim
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9635025858879089;attention was drawn in that context to the expected shortterm profile of inflation which after a pickup around the turn of the year owing to oil pricerelated base effects could fall back to relatively low levels in early 2016 members therefore emphasised the need to continue analysing the strength and persistence of the factors behind the current period of low inflation and to understand the medium to longterm implications of such low inflation
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9889732003211975;first it was considered important to monitor the implications of headline inflation developments for measures of underlying inflation such as the hicp excluding food and energy prices
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9910374879837036;concern was expressed that the passthrough of low commodity prices to core inflation had recently appeared to be relatively fast and pronounced
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8842630386352539;at the same time the point was made that robust evidence of secondround effects from energy prices on headline inflation had so far been largely absent
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9905290007591248;second it was argued that the persistence of low inflation in the euro area was part of a wider phenomenon of low global inflation and that a sustained rise in euro area prices would be difficult to achieve in the absence of a global pickup in inflation
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9915281534194946;the importance of global factors was also visible in measures of inflation expectations as shortterm movements in those measures for the euro area the united states and the united kingdom were seen to be highly correlated
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Positive;0.6146788597106934;at the same time it was highlighted that domestic factors notably related to demand and economic slack also played a crucial role in explaining the prolonged period of low inflation
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Negative;0.8212931752204895;third attention was drawn to structural determinants of low inflation
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9007092714309692;in particular structural changes in technology consumer behaviour and competition could partly explain low inflation
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9946331977844238;however it was widely remarked that the low inflation environment in the euro area nonetheless largely reflected demandside factors in the context of protracted weak growth and high unemployment
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9873510003089905;fourth the outlook for price stability could still usefully be assessed on the basis of the future path of economic activity and the output gap as well as the relationship between activity and prices as measured by the phillips curve
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9892226457595825;as on previous occasions members underlined that measures of the output gap were surrounded by significant uncertainty
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9903578162193298;concern was expressed that labour market slack could be higher than estimated especially if involuntary parttime work and discouraged workers more generally were taken into account
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.511048436164856;reference was also made to academic research suggesting that the slope of the phillips curve may have steepened in recent years implying that a significant degree of slack in the economy would correspond ceteris paribus to lower levels of inflation
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9690530896186829;fifth it was seen as important to continue monitoring closely the impact of the protracted period of low inflation on inflation expectations
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.994877278804779;it was noted that surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations had remained unchanged at 19 according to the latest spf and that marketbased measures of inflation expectations had broadly stabilised since late august
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Negative;0.839573085308075;some comfort was drawn from these recent developments as they suggested that the recent weakness in headline and core inflation had not had a negative impact on expectations
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Negative;0.5959062576293945;however concern was also expressed that marketbased measures of inflation expectations remained low had not shown an upward trend over recent weeks and indicated that inflation was expected to reach 19 as late as 2025 in assessing the risks to the outlook for inflation members noted that downside risks remained prevalent and had possibly increased
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9732090830802917;these risks stemmed mainly from uncertainties regarding the economic outlook and the persistence of the output gap in the euro area as well as from global oil and commodity price developments
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9771482944488525;as regards the latter it was highlighted that recent oil and commodity price declines also reflected demanddriven factors and could not be expected to be reversed quickly
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Negative;0.993607759475708;in addition concerns were voiced that the current prolonged period of low inflation was in itself a source of downside risk as it could contribute to an unanchoring of inflation expectations
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9827289581298828;reference was also made to a potential deflationary scenario which could not be fully excluded as a tail risk
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.7563217878341675;nevertheless it was highlighted that the likelihood of deflation had decreased since the start of the year according to marketbased measures
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9899417757987976;with regard to the monetary analysis members concurred with the assessment presented by mr praet in his introduction that recent data had confirmed solid growth in m3 notwithstanding a decline in the annual growth rate in august
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9771958589553833;loan dynamics had continued to improve pursuing the gradual recovery observed since the beginning of 2014 the bank lending survey for the third quarter of 2015 had confirmed an increase in demand for bank loans and a further easing of credit standards on loans to enterprises while those on loans to households for house purchase had tightened somewhat
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9889662861824036;these developments in money and credit growth albeit with bank lending remaining at relatively low levels were widely seen as positive signs for a continuation of the recovery path reflecting significant monetary accommodation and the gradual passthrough of the ecbs broad set of measures with financial fragmentation in the distribution of credit and credit conditions receding
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9804803133010864;as confirmed by the bank lending survey favourable funding conditions and increased competition between banks were supporting an easing of lending conditions and credit standards
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9729506373405457;together with the reported improvement in credit demand this should underpin credit expansion in the euro area in the period ahead also considering that there was still significant monetary accommodation to feed through to the economy from the ecbs asset purchases as well as the three tltros yet to come
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Negative;0.918843686580658;at the same time it was underlined that heterogeneity remained an issue with money and credit growth still well into negative territory in countries that had been most affected by the financial crisis in contrast to relatively robust growth elsewhere
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9936955571174622;some caution was also expressed about the risk of possible pressure for further deleveraging by euro area banks
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9884154796600342;monetary policy stance and policy considerations with regard to the monetary policy stance members widely shared the assessment provided by mr praet in his introduction
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Positive;0.8283499479293823;the information that had become available since the governing councils meeting in early september broadly confirmed the ongoing recovery
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9775199294090271;it also pointed to continued weak price pressures and suggested that the expected timing of a sustained normalisation of inflation could be pushed back further which called for a thorough analysis of the factors that were currently slowing the return of inflation to levels below but close to 2 over the medium term
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9533569812774658;it was recalled that at its previous monetary policy meeting the governing council had felt that it was premature to conclude whether adverse external developments and increased downside risks would have a transitory or lasting impact on the euro area price outlook and on a sustainable adjustment towards a path in line with the ecbs mediumterm inflation aim
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9890923500061035;on the basis of the economic and monetary analyses of incoming data a range of arguments were offered as to whether it could already be concluded that there was a material change in the outlook that warranted a policy response or if further evidence and analysis were needed particularly in the context of the december eurosystem staff projections
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9946454763412476;against this background members voiced concern about the prospect of a further deterioration in the price outlook including at the policyrelevant mediumterm horizon with risks clearly on the downside
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9236518740653992;attention was drawn in particular to the loss of momentum in the turnaround of various indicators of underlying inflation with inflation excluding food and energy appearing to be stuck at below or around 1
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9265451431274414;there had also been a repeated undershooting of inflation relative to projections by ecbeurosystem staff and by other public and private forecasters
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9879341125488281;it was emphasised that while the ecbs asset purchase programmes and lending operations were working as intended in expanding liquidity supporting favourable financing conditions and ultimately reaching output and prices there had been a number of countervailing developments in external conditions
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9903297424316406;these included persistently low oil prices weaknesses in emerging economies and the postponement of the expected adjustment in policy rates in the united states
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9878249168395996;taken together the impact of external factors and heightened uncertainty raised the possibility that the ecbs measures despite their magnitude might not be gaining sufficient traction in the present environment to achieve their ultimate objective in terms of inflation rates also in view of low price pressures globally
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Negative;0.99460768699646;attention was drawn in this context to the very slow recovery of euro area output in the wake of the financial and sovereign debt crisis
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Negative;0.7323821187019348;it was argued that in such an environment the risk of deflation remained relevant
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9836769104003906;against this background the view was put forward that a case could be made for considering reinforcing the ecbs accommodative monetary policy stance already at the current meeting and in any case to act sooner rather than later
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9760617017745972;at the same time members expressed caution about adopting an unduly gloomy interpretation of recent data and reaching premature conclusions with respect to policy implications
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9897083640098572;recent data had been mixed overall with some positive signs and comfort could be drawn from the resilience of the domestic economy notwithstanding a weaker external environment
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9762015342712402;this suggested that the environment had not changed materially since the previous monetary policy meeting
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8599684834480286;it was therefore seen as preferable to wait until december to reassess whether there had been a sufficient change in the factors underlying the mediumterm outlook for price stability
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9924962520599365;the renewed deterioration in inflation data had been largely due to commodity prices and external factors as well as possibly to structural changes outside the domain of monetary policy while surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations remained well anchored
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9337612986564636;moreover there appeared to be no indications of a risk of deflation in the sense of a selfreinforcing expectationsdriven broadbased decrease in the price level
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9930758476257324;with regard to monetary and financial conditions members generally concurred with mr praet that these had remained broadly unchanged from the governing councils early september meeting while they had tightened relative to the technical assumptions embedded in the september 2015 staff projections
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9082202911376953;this tightening mainly reflected an appreciation of the euro which had reversed about half of the earlier depreciation seen until the spring of 2015 associated with the announcement of the expanded app
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Negative;0.7047239542007446;at the same time it was argued that looking at a broader range of indicators gave a more benign picture
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9912509918212891;in particular interest rate indicators continued to signal an accommodative monetary policy stance and developments in bank lending were consistent with a continued recovery in loans to the nonfinancial private sector
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9929074048995972;at the same time crisisrelated fragmentation spreads and risk premia had been receding
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9706135392189026;it was therefore maintained that one could not unambiguously conclude that the monetary policy stance had tightened
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.5110981464385986;with respect to the effectiveness of the measures taken by the governing council in 2014 and 2015 members generally concurred that they had had a favourable impact on financial conditions and were gradually working their way through to the real economy with effects at the early stages of the transmission mechanism clearly visible for example in measures of liquidity shortterm interest rates bank lending rates and easing credit conditions as well as with respect to reducing fragmentation in credit distribution and conditions
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8543627858161926;moreover it was highlighted that much of the accommodation from the ecbs measures was still in the pipeline
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9201744794845581;the presence of long and variable lags in monetary transmission was seen to argue in favour of patience before considering changes to the app which was still only eight months into its expected 19month lifespan
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Negative;0.7857297658920288;at the same time it was highlighted that while monetary policy had been effective in achieving intermediate targets such as improving financial conditions turning around the credit cycle and reducing financial fragmentation it had so far not been able to deliver a noticeable impact on its final target ie

2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Negative;0.7108213305473328;this posed a challenge to the governing council in formulating the most appropriate stance for the euro areas monetary policy
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9777212738990784;one possible implication was that it might be necessary to acknowledge the longer time horizon over which monetary policy could be expected to deliver on its ultimate objective in the current environment which did not necessarily speak in favour of additional measures at the current juncture
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.6053242087364197;another reflection pointed to the need for more forceful action or for considering a broader set of tools to ensure adequate transmission to the real economy and to underpin a firm anchoring of inflation expectations
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.988797128200531;this suggested that the full menu of available monetary policy instruments should be examined in depth
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9140570759773254;at the same time it was urgently felt that the crucial role played by other policy areas needed to be underlined so as to avoid overburdening monetary policy and to ensure that other policy areas contributed to a more satisfactory economic outcome in the euro area
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9226801991462708;the low interest rate environment was seen as providing an opportunity for governments to proceed decisively with necessary structural reforms
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9952442049980164;however disappointment was expressed about the insufficient speed of structural reforms that had been observed and the lack of supportive action in the fiscal domain including a lack of momentum behind the juncker plan
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9825902581214905;a number of preliminary remarks were made on possible options for providing further monetary accommodation should this become necessary
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9909588098526001;with regard to adjusting the size composition or duration of the app it was underlined that the present communication already catered for the possibility of extending the programme beyond september 2016 depending on progress in achieving a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation towards the mediumterm objective
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.991302490234375;adjusting the overall size and range of eligible assets was seen as requiring further analysis by ecb staff and the relevant committees
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9770654439926147;other options might also be examined
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9900147914886475;preliminary views were also expressed on the option of further lowering policy rates in particular the rate on the deposit facility
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9654355645179749;reference was made to the experience in other jurisdictions where negative rates had not appeared to result in major difficulties or widespread substitution into cash
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9458205103874207;however it was also argued that a rate cut would venture further into uncharted territory and have repercussions on the functioning of markets and the behaviour of banks and customers
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.986406147480011;for this reason further technical staff and committee work was seen as necessary to assess the benefits and costs particularly regarding the impact on money markets and on banks margins and lending capacity
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9915069937705994;against this background it was therefore seen as necessary to step up communication and underscore the governing councils determination and readiness to act as soon as warranted by new information and a new assessment with the december eurosystem staff projections allowing for an indepth reflection on the monetary policy stance
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Negative;0.8442772626876831;this would confirm the ecbs reaction function in the light of evolving data and would also serve to counter possible misconceptions that the ecb might tolerate a persistent undershooting of its objective or not have sufficient tools to be employed effectively
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.980697512626648;at the same time a need was seen to communicate a full reassessment of the situation and a comprehensive review of policy options in december while not creating undue expectations or being perceived as precommitting to a certain course of action
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9902770519256592;monetary policy decisions and communication taking into account the views expressed by the governing council the president concluded that the degree of monetary policy accommodation would need to be reexamined at the december monetary policy meeting
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9928547739982605;accordingly ecb staff and the relevant eurosystem committees would be mandated to conduct a technical analysis of the monetary policy stimulus achieved review the options available should the governing council judge that further monetary accommodation was necessary and analyse them in terms of efficacy
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9916955828666687;it was underlined that the governing council was willing and able to act if warranted by using all available tools within its mandate including by adjusting the size composition and duration of the app
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9939648509025574;it was recalled that the monthly asset purchases of 60 billion would be fully implemented until the end of september 2016 or beyond if necessary and in any case until a sustained adjustment was visible in the path of inflation that was consistent with the governing councils aim of achieving inflation rates below but close to 2 over the medium term
2015-11-19;2015;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9921764731407166;on a proposal from the president the governing council decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility would remain unchanged at 005 030 and 020 respectively
