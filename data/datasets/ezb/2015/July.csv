2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9935572743415833;in this context it was underlined that even if the output gap was closing over the projection horizon output growth in the euro area was developing below its precrisis longterm trend owing in part to past low investment
2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9220704436302185;the euro area was thus experiencing a cyclical rather than a structural recovery
2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9941408038139343;at the same time the wellknown uncertainty surrounding estimates of the output gap was recalled which supported a cautious interpretation of the output gap

2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9832920432090759;on the one hand it was noted that one of the key features of the current projections and one of the factors supporting growth was the broadly neutral fiscal stance from 2014 onwards after the more restrictive fiscal stance in previous years
2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9919828772544861;the point was made that even if the fiscal stance for the euro area was neutral overall from a macroeconomic perspective different policy advice was warranted for different countries

2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9745639562606812;at the same time the comment was made that the stability and growth pact seemed to be once more incorrectly perceived to be about reaching the 3 government deficit ratio rather than about aiming for a structural government budget balance close to zero in the medium term
2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9205840826034546;in this context it was important to learn from the mistakes of the past

2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9855103492736816;with regard to price developments there was broad agreement with the assessment presented by mr praet in his introduction
2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9107365608215332;reference was made to eurostats flash estimate according to which euro area annual hicp inflation had risen to 03 in may 2015 the first positive rate since late 2014 reflecting higher annual growth rates for all main components of the hicp
2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9657801389694214;while the outcome in may was slightly above market expectations it was in line with the june eurosystem staff projections

2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9824348092079163;inflation seemed to have bottomed out at the beginning of the year
2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9882473349571228;while expected to remain low over the months ahead inflation rates were seen to rise visibly towards the end of the year and to pick up further in 2016 and 2017 this assessment was also broadly reflected in the june 2015 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections
2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8042300343513489;the pickup in inflation was expected to be supported by the gradual closing of the output gap the impact of the lower exchange rate of the euro and the assumed path of oil prices according to oil futures markets
2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9906259775161743;accordingly the inflation profile for 201516 also reflected base effects on account of the sharp fall in oil prices in late 2014 a number of other positive indications were also highlighted including the recovery of inflation expectations from their troughs in early 2015 and the absence of significant deflation risks
2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9893920421600342;members took note of these developments in particular of the confirmation of the inflation outlook provided by the projections
2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.5365501642227173;at the same time it was noted that the role of external factors in this turnaround appeared to be significant
2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9906589984893799;it would therefore be very important to monitor carefully domestic inflation indicators in order to assess whether a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation had been achieved
2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9731449484825134;it was underlined that the degree of forecast uncertainty tended to increase with the length of the projection horizon and it remained to be seen whether inflation would increase as strongly as projected by staff
2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.6616000533103943;in particular the size of the output gap and the speed at which it closed would have important implications for the inflation rate in 2017 two issues were noted in this context
2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8261518478393555;first while it had to be recognised that there was substantial measurement uncertainty the output gap in the june eurosystem staff projections was assessed to close somewhat faster than the estimates of some international institutions
2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9911164045333862;second since 2010 core inflation in the euro area had been around 1¼ with movements in headline inflation being driven primarily by developments in the noncore components of the hicp
2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9855415225028992;the governing council should therefore not draw conclusions prematurely in particular as regards the price outlook for 2017 but rather continue its close monitoring and assessment of underlying price trends
2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9826282262802124;the inflation outlook embedded in the staff projections was also seen to be based on a fairly strong passthrough of the past depreciation of the exchange rate and to depend on a future upward path of oil prices
2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9751421809196472;as regards the former different views were expressed by members
2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Negative;0.8738126158714294;it was pointed out that over the past 1015 years the passthrough of the exchange rate had been slower following large movements
2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9898749589920044;the passthrough had also been slow so far for the euro area
2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.6963149905204773;a pricingtomarket strategy on the part of euro area exporters which implied higher euro prices following the depreciation of the euro represented a low passthrough to importing countries
2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8943025469779968;at the same time it could be argued that this was not that surprising as exporting firms needed to see where the exchange rate would stabilise

2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9906333684921265;in their assessment of the risks surrounding the inflation outlook members referred to the passthrough of the monetary policy measures as well as geopolitical exchange rate and energy price developments
2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9836595058441162;while there was broad agreement on the need to monitor closely the risks to the outlook the governing council saw recent developments as overall confirming its previous assessment and the staff projections
2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9871194362640381;with regard to the monetary analysis members concurred with the assessment that money and credit dynamics had strengthened further although credit growth had improved only gradually and remained overall subdued
2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9884767532348633;recent data had confirmed that growth in broad money m3 had continued to accelerate driven by a further pickup in the narrow monetary aggregate m1
2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Positive;0.990199863910675;the robust recovery in the most liquid components of money was seen to reflect a more pronounced preference for liquidity given the low opportunity cost of holding monetary instruments
2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9753842353820801;as a result there had been a substitution within mfi liabilities towards shortterm instruments included in m3 owing to the low incentives for the moneyholding sector to invest in alternative assets as their returns were not high enough to compensate for the loss of transaction services that money offered
2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9226601123809814;in addition the most recent acceleration in broad money growth was starting to reflect the effects of the eurosystems asset purchases from the euro area moneyholding sector in particular via increased holdings of monetary deposits by nonmonetary financial intermediaries especially investment funds
2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9541518092155457;all in all caution was still seen to be warranted as regards possible monetary policy interpretations of recent favourable dynamics in money growth
2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9659169316291809;loan dynamics while remaining subdued had gradually improved further
2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9838176965713501;though the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector had remained at 08 in april a positive signal was visible from developments over the previous six months whereby loans to the private sector on a sixmonth annualised basis recorded a growth rate of 2
2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9904459714889526;these developments had been supported by significant decreases in composite bank lending rates which had declined by around 60 basis points for euro area nonfinancial corporations since may 2014 as well as by signs of an improvement in both the supply of and demand for bank loans
2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.5185858011245728;in particular banks showed a greater willingness to lend as extending credit had become relatively more attractive in the context of a negative rate on the deposit facility whereby individual banks were seeking ways to avoid the higher cost of keeping deposits with the eurosystem although this was not possible for the banking system to achieve in the aggregate
2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9803901314735413;overall also taking into account the pipeline effects from the interest rate cuts in 2013 and 2014 the crediteasing package from the summer of 2014 and the comprehensive assessment of banks balance sheets recent developments confirmed that the ecbs monetary policy measures were helping to restore the proper functioning of the monetary policy transmission mechanism and were continuing to support a further recovery in credit flows to firms and households
2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Negative;0.5464988350868225;complementing earlier positive evidence from the bank lending survey on the general improvements in credit market conditions the recent survey on enterprises access to finance safe had provided indications that the more favourable credit environment not only applied to large firms but was also trickling down to smes
2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9945211410522461;despite these improvements the dynamics of loans to nonfinancial corporations remained subdued
2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9575523734092712;this could in part be attributed to the ongoing adjustment of financial and nonfinancial sector balance sheets which was still incomplete as evidenced by the high level of nonperforming loans in some countries where a clear turnaround could not yet be discerned
2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8823307752609253;at the same time it was felt that increased recourse to various forms of nonbank sources of financing needed to be taken into account in the assessment alongside the bank lending channel
2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9890092015266418;in this context it was noted that an environment of weak credit growth coupled with attractive financing conditions also required caution on the part of the relevant authorities with regard to possible financial stability implications arising in particular from a shift of intermediation activity into the shadow banking sector
2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9877875447273254;monetary policy stance and policy considerations members generally shared the assessment that the economic recovery was proceeding at a moderate pace in line with earlier expectations with inflation continuing its upward trajectory and money and credit dynamics strengthening further supported by the accommodative monetary policy stance
2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9857574701309204;members also recalled that the outlook for growth and inflation as portrayed in the june 2015 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections which were virtually unchanged from the march ecb staff projections was predicated on the full implementation of all the monetary policy measures taken by the governing council
2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9891371130943298;overall there was broad agreement that crosschecking the assessment of economic and monetary developments did not give reason to reconsider the current monetary policy stance or any of the app parameters
2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.6544120907783508;this called for maintaining a steady monetary policy course firmly implementing the governing councils monetary policy measures
2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.7448949217796326;regarding the need to assess the recent sharp fluctuations in financial market prices from a monetary policy perspective as suggested by mr praet in his introduction there was broad agreement that the recent partial reversal of previous strong increases in financial market prices was of a multifaceted nature and was likely to be related to the three factors mentioned by mr cœuré namely a reappraisal of the economic outlook by market participants the observed recovery in inflation expectations since early 2015 and a number of technical market factors
2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9431645274162292;recent financial market developments had been dominated by sharp movements in government bonds accompanied by a fall in equities and a stronger euro which however on balance were not assessed to have materially altered the economic outlook for the euro area
2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9477422833442688;on this basis it was widely felt that it was advisable for the governing council to look through recent financial market volatility
2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9894220232963562;as stated on previous occasions if there were factors that led to an unwarranted tightening of monetary policy or if the outlook for growth and inflation were to materially change the features of the monetary policy programmes in place would have to be reviewed
2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9249961376190186;there was however no reason to do so now
2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Positive;0.925172746181488;as regards the factors behind volatility in financial market prices to the extent that the rise in longerterm real interest rates and the reappreciation of the euro were related to expectations of an improved macroeconomic outlook this was to be seen as a confirmation of the current monetary policy stance
2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.84359210729599;to the extent that the recent reversal was a correction driven mainly by technical factors volatility could subside again as markets adjusted to the new market environment characterised by the injection of cash associated with the eurosystems asset purchases and the implications for the pricing of sovereign bonds
2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9682521224021912;however there were also reasons to expect that increased volatility would persist in an environment of low interest rates in which asset prices tended to be more volatile as also borne out by the experience in other jurisdictions
2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Negative;0.990538477897644;prevailing geopolitical risks and continued uncertainty about the outcome of negotiations between one euro area government and its official creditors were also seen as likely sources of market uncertainty and volatility

2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9851998090744019;taking a somewhat longerterm perspective the monetary policy measures introduced since the summer of 2014 had contributed to a broadbased easing in financial conditions which remained very accommodative in spite of the recent reversal in financial market prices
2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Positive;0.7127804160118103;in particular shortterm money market rates remained at historically low levels and in line with the governing councils forward guidance on the key policy interest rates and the ongoing expansion of the eurosystem balance sheet

2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9869788885116577;against this background members widely agreed that it was essential to maintain a steady course of monetary policy looking through shortterm economic and financial market developments to the extent that they were temporary and would not have a materially adverse impact on the transmission of monetary policy and ultimately on the mediumterm outlook for price stability
2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9867255687713623;this included leaving the key ecb interest rates unchanged in line with the governing councils forward guidance and firmly implementing the nonstandard monetary policy measures adopted
2015-07-02;2015;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9618040919303894;monetary policy decisions and communication overall taking into account the views expressed the president concluded that the governing council was unanimous in its assessment that it should look through recent volatility in financial markets and maintain a steady monetary policy course
