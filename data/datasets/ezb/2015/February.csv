2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Negative;0.753070056438446;the incoming information had been broadly in line with the shortterm outlook for real gdp growth as contained in the december 2014 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections and remained consistent with both moderate growth around the turn of the year and a gradual economic recovery in the period ahead which was still uncertain and subject to downside risks
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9943663477897644;the main news since the governing councils meeting on 4 december 2014 had been the further substantial decline in oil prices

2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.5901302695274353;at the same time it was highlighted that recent supportive financial market developments largely reflected market expectations about the monetary policy decisions to be taken at the current meeting
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8885650634765625;accordingly a reversal of recent financial market developments could be expected if no further monetary policy measures were announced
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9627785682678223;if this were to occur the associated positive impact on the growth and price outlook could be unwound and a higher degree of volatility or instability in the financial markets could create additional risks
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9895005822181702;the remark was also made however that the depreciation of the euro against the us dollar could fundamentally be attributed to the different growth paths in the united states and the euro area rather than only to monetary policy expectations regarding an announcement of a largescale asset purchase programme by the ecb following the meeting
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9949852228164673;the assessment was widely shared that developments in the euro area economy continued to be characterised by protracted weak demand and a lack of confidence as reflected in particular in persistently weak investment
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Positive;0.7061988115310669;this also confirmed the continued need to address underlying structural weaknesses and to improve the business environment in order to unlock the euro areas growth potential
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Positive;0.978465735912323;against this background lower oil prices should be a positive factor supporting the outlook for growth in the euro area and might go some way towards mitigating downside risks to growth
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Negative;0.8492710590362549;the remark was made that there were even upside risks to the outlook for growth because of the oil price shock
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Positive;0.8379955887794495;however this positive impact was conditional on the extent to which the fall in oil prices was driven by supply factors as opposed to demand factors
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9819338917732239;in this context the decline in oil prices over most of 2014 was widely considered to have been the result of a combination of both supply and demand factors while there seemed to be a consensus that in the most recent period it was mainly related to supply factors which should be positive for growth
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9908402562141418;lower oil prices should eventually feed through to investment trends and consumption should also be supported by higher real disposable income
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Positive;0.5741617679595947;while global growth remained modest there were signs of a gradual uneven recovery which should also be supported by the lower oil prices
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9754984974861145;with this in mind the remark was made that a more optimistic assessment of economic developments was possible as several signs seemed to be positive
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9945999383926392;however there were several sources of uncertainty about the magnitude of the positive impact on growth from lower oil prices
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Negative;0.5424547791481018;for example lower oil prices could also imply higher saving ratios rather than higher domestic spending by firms and households
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9463425874710083;while this would be positive for growth over a longerterm horizon and would support the ongoing deleveraging process and the strengthening of balance sheets it would not contribute to supporting demand over the shorter term
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.4453813433647156;on balance it was argued that lower oil prices should in any case allow the governing council to have more confidence in the economic recovery while it was less clear whether the oil price decline would mainly affect the balance of risks to the outlook for growth or whether it would translate into an effective upward revision to euro area growth
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.7431609630584717;at this juncture members broadly shared the view that they would maintain their assessment that on balance the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook were on the downside while downside risks had diminished as a result of the fall in oil prices
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9855103492736816;with regard to price developments there was broad agreement with the assessment presented by mr praet in his introduction
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Negative;0.975442111492157;euro area hicp inflation had fallen to 02 in december 2014 largely reflecting the drop in oil prices
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9311581254005432;inflation had thus turned negative for the first time since 2009 the impact of changes in oil prices in euro terms since the finalisation of the december 2014 eurosystem staff projection exercise would substantially lower the euro area headline hicp inflation rate in 2015 which was likely to remain in negative territory for most of the year
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9889573454856873;therefore there was now a higher risk of inflation being too low for too long a period of time
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9895658493041992;in the current fragile environment with persistent low price pressures it was underlined that the governing council was not in a comfortable position to look through price shocks even when they originated on the supply side
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9759413003921509;however the argument was also advanced that the current very low rates of inflation should be seen primarily in the light of falling oil prices and when looking at exclusion measures of the hicp such as the hicp excluding food and energy inflation remained stable at around 07
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9901671409606934;in that context it was however also observed that a significant part of the decline in inflation since late 2011 had been due to developments in services and nonenergy industrial goods prices suggesting weak domestic demand and indicating that there were some adverse spillovers from developments in energy and food prices to other hicp components
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9526280164718628;at the same time it was underlined that the euro area was not currently experiencing deflation according to the usual definition and no forecasts available from either the ecb or international institutions such as the international monetary fund and the european commission pointed to a deflationary situation
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9291207194328308;attention was also drawn to the fact that while a substantial downward revision to the inflation path for 2015 could be expected the potential revisions for 2016  closer to the relevant mediumterm horizon  were less clear as the impact of lower oil prices had to be assessed in conjunction with the impact of the recent exchange rate depreciation and the lagged impact on prices from improved growth prospects also needed to be taken into account
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.5180405378341675;nonetheless it was widely acknowledged that the risk of secondround effects needed to be considered very seriously
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.6600975394248962;on the one hand it could be argued that the risk of such effects was relatively small owing to the asymmetric effects of wage indexation with indexation clauses often not applicable when inflation was in negative territory and the prevalence of nominal rigidities notwithstanding structural changes in wagesetting in a number of countries since the onset of the crisis
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9330589771270752;on the other hand however there was broad agreement that the potential for secondround effects even if uncertain constituted a major downside risk to the inflation outlook and needed to be monitored closely
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9720584750175476;this was particularly important given the downward movements in marketbased inflation expectations and the already long period of very low inflation in the euro area together with the likelihood of several more quarters of low or even negative rates of inflation
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9791395664215088;with regard to inflation expectations a number of remarks were made on how recent developments in survey and financial marketbased indicators should be interpreted
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9026620388031006;there was some evidence of an increased sensitivity of inflation expectations to negative inflation shocks and marketbased measures of inflation expectations at different horizons had been declining
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9629765152931213;it could therefore be considered that there was a higher risk of an unanchoring of inflation expectations
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9768614172935486;at the same time developments in marketbased inflation expectations required further analysis
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9143707156181335;the impact of oil prices on inflation expectations should in principle be transitory and of limited relevance over mediumterm and longerterm horizons
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9819451570510864;one explanation for why this was currently not reflected in marketbased expectations was that liquidity distortions might be playing a role or that the decline could be related to a further reduction in inflation risk premia
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9908517003059387;in line with such interpretations surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations were still broadly unchanged at around 18
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9503167867660522;declines in marketbased inflation expectations also appeared to be an international phenomenon with similar developments occurring in the united states despite large quantitative easing programmes
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9797313809394836;in this respect more analysis was needed including of the role of factors such as globalisation or technological change
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.7128062844276428;however the point was made that even if such factors were at work and pronounced changes in relative prices were to take place it was still the task of monetary policy to anchor price stability in aggregate terms
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.7467715740203857;taking all arguments into account the risk of an unanchoring of inflation expectations was generally perceived as a matter of concern for the euro area and it was crucial to avoid any potential impact of the currently very low inflation rates on mediumterm wage and pricesetting behaviour
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9935601949691772;the potential adverse impact of lower inflation expectations and low or negative inflation on real gdp growth also continued to be a matter of concern
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.6435011029243469;it was remarked that the large oil price shock had had an immediate downward impact on inflation and to some extent on inflation expectations while the positive effects on income would take longer to materialise
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8930982947349548;moreover in assessing the economic impact of falling inflation the environment of fragile inflation expectations and elevated debt levels needed to be taken into account
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Positive;0.7416884303092957;with regard to the monetary analysis the members generally shared the assessment that recent data indicated a recovery in the underlying growth of broad money albeit at low levels
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9945751428604126;loan growth remained in negative territory while continuing its gradual recovery from the trough observed in february 2014 it was recalled that weak monetary growth could be explained by the ongoing adjustment of financial and nonfinancial sector balance sheets and weak economic activity
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9917335510253906;at the same time it was underlined that there were also some positive signs in the recent data as evidenced by recent loan dynamics and falling borrowing costs
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9836313724517822;evidence from the january 2015 bank lending survey had also provided further positive signals for a continued recovery of credit markets indicating a further net easing of credit standards for all loan categories in the fourth quarter of 2014 banks expected that these dynamics would continue in early 2015 overall however from a historical perspective the level of credit standards remained relatively tight
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9640781879425049;monetary policy stance and policy considerations with regard to the monetary policy stance the members broadly shared the assessment that inflation dynamics had continued to be weaker than expected economic slack had remained sizeable and money and credit developments had continued to be subdued notwithstanding recent more positive monetary developments
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9906043410301208;the governing council was thus faced with heightened risks of too prolonged a period of too low inflation
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9902673363685608;on the basis of its reassessment of the outlook for price stability and the monetary policy stimulus achieved the governing council discussed i whether or not there was a need for policy action at the current meeting ii which instruments to use if additional monetary policy measures were seen as warranted and iii how to frame the regime of risk sharing and the precise implementation modalities to be applied to an expanded asset purchase programme
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9938203692436218;as a general starting point all members considered asset purchases including sovereign bond purchases to be part of the set of monetary policy instruments which as foreseen in the ecbs legal framework were at the governing councils disposal if and when required for it to deliver on its price stability mandate although some members argued that this instrument should only be used in contingency situations
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9885459542274475;a number of considerations were put forward in support of monetary policy action being taken at the current meeting
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9686000347137451;while the existing monetary policy measures adopted in june and september 2014 were showing encouraging results with regard to a further improvement in overall financing conditions it had become increasingly evident that they would fall short in quantitative terms
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Negative;0.8747581839561462;this implied that the expected stimulus via funding cost relief and the boost to lending provided by the tltros and the existing private sector asset purchase programmes was more limited than had initially been envisaged
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9940783977508545;the view was widely shared that inflation developments continued to be weaker than expected
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9403124451637268;inflation outturns had been on a continuous downward trend which had led to successive downward revisions of the inflation outlook for the euro area to levels well below the governing councils aim of inflation rates over the medium term of below but close to 2
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9866223931312561;in addition shorterterm inflation dynamics had started to influence inflation expectations at longerterm horizons
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Negative;0.954341471195221;in this context the potential for secondround effects on wage and pricesetting had increased significantly increasing the risk of inflation remaining too low for too prolonged a period of time
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9448321461677551;taking into account both the weakened mediumterm outlook for price stability and the smaller than envisaged monetary stimulus introduced by the policy measures adopted in june and september 2014 the prevailing degree of monetary policy accommodation was seen to fall short of sufficiently countering the heightened risks to the ecbs mediumterm price stability objective
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9898154735565186;against this background there was a broadly shared view that the conditions were fully in place for taking additional monetary policy action at the current meeting
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9546553492546082;moreover an unwelcome tightening in the monetary policy stance  as reflected for example in higher real interest rates in an environment of declining prices with policy rates at the lower bound  needed to be countered
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9737744331359863;monetary policy needed to act to anchor inflation expectations in line with price stability over the medium term
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9846322536468506;such anchoring required forceful policy action in addressing too low a level of inflation just as had been the case in the past when countering inflation rates above the ecbs price stability objective
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Positive;0.5356819033622742;in addition the current meeting was the right time to take monetary policy action as it would allow the measures to provide decisive support to the momentum of the recovery in the period ahead
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9372833371162415;a number of considerations in favour of maintaining a waitandsee stance at the current meeting were also advanced by some members as the costbenefit assessment of the proposed measures was not positive in their view
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9444805383682251;in short a slightly different assessment of the economic situation the inflation outlook and money and loan dynamics could be made the effectiveness of the proposed measures could be questioned and the potential negative side effects of these measures should not be underestimated
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9906664490699768;in greater detail although inflation had fallen uncomfortably low the recent sharp decline in oil prices had been the dominant factor behind the decline
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9077118039131165;given the uncertainty about the impact of the oil price shock on the mediumterm price outlook notably in view of its positive impulse for growth prospects and the possibility that the oil price shock might be a oneoff event or might reverse the extent to which the relevant mediumterm inflation outlook had changed significantly remained unclear
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8754043579101562;accordingly risks of secondround effects seemed rather contained
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9924519658088684;moreover recent declines in inflation expectations might also be mainly driven by negative inflation risk premia low liquidity and high uncertainty which while worrying developments could not be taken as evidence of an unanchoring of inflation expectations
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9933373928070068;reference was again made to the marketbased measures of longterm inflation expectations in the united states which were currently moving in tandem with those in the euro area despite the implementation of largescale asset purchases in the united states
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9363136291503906;on the basis of these considerations in the view of some members there appeared to be no urgent need for monetary policy action at the current meeting
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.7668858170509338;in particular broad financial and monetary conditions including interest rate and exchange rate developments had provided additional stimulus over recent weeks
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Positive;0.6768594980239868;moreover while the decline in inflation expectations had led to a tightening in the monetary policy stance in terms of real shortterm interest rates real lending rates for loans to nfcs had improved more recently for example when compared with their level in may 2014 in this context it was also highlighted that there was still monetary accommodation in the pipeline owing to the ongoing implementation of the existing monetary policy measures and the full effect of these measures on the economy was still to be seen
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9284116625785828;it was also cautioned that the case for action could not be separated from the issue of the choice of instrument
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.634251058101654;purchases of sovereign bonds were associated with a number of challenges and side effects particularly related to the nature of sovereign bond purchases within the specific institutional framework of economic and monetary union
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9672005772590637;therefore purchases of sovereign bonds should remain a contingency instrument of monetary policy to be used only as a last resort in the event of an extremely adverse scenario such as a downward deflationary spiral
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8660500049591064;however thus far there was no evidence of a serious risk of deflation which clearly argued against mobilising the instrument of sovereign bond purchases at the current meeting
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9389320611953735;as regards the most appropriate instruments for achieving additional monetary stimulus the point was made that purchases of corporate bonds possibly complemented by purchases of supranational bonds could be seen as the most natural extension of the governing councils credit easing package representing a more targeted measure directed towards a further improvement in the financing conditions of firms
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9281813502311707;however it was widely judged that given the current level of corporate bond yields and the size of the corporate bond market the credit easing potential of corporate bond purchases appeared rather small and therefore offered only limited scope for providing the degree of accommodation needed at this stage
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9802369475364685;at the same time the remark was made that this asset class should not be excluded from future consideration if needed
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9906214475631714;consequently it was broadly agreed that any further monetary policy measure would need to involve purchases of government securities
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9592637419700623;one of the variants mentioned namely to limit the purchases to a portfolio comprising only sovereign bonds of the euro area countries with the highest credit ratings was generally regarded as being insufficiently effective
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9582031965255737;against this backdrop a large number of members were in favour of expanding the existing private sector asset purchase programmes to include purchases of a broad portfolio of securities of euro area governments and agencies and of supranational institutions
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9896124005317688;purchases of sovereign debt appeared to be the only remaining instrument of sufficient scope to provide the necessary monetary stimulus to deliver on the ecbs price stability objective
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Negative;0.8408135175704956;through the compression of euro area sovereign yields portfolio rebalancing effects could be set in motion including spillovers to the prices of a multitude of other assets
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9556294679641724;as a result forces would materialise which would lead to an easing of conditions across broad sources of financing including those relevant for the borrowing conditions of euro area nfcs and households
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9034380316734314;some degree of caution was still expressed with regard to the potential effectiveness of sovereign bond purchases
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Negative;0.8545003533363342;sovereign bond yields in the euro area had already approached rather low levels limiting the scope for further yield compression and consequently the potential funding cost relief to be passed on to final borrowers financing conditions
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9906018972396851;in addition portfolio rebalancing effects could turn out to be more muted than envisaged given the ongoing need for balance sheet adjustment in the financial and nonfinancial sectors
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9830009937286377;moreover in the united states the capital marketbased transmission channels were at work most notably via direct effects on mortgage and housing markets and the greater role of corporate bond markets and these factors might be weaker in the case of the euro area
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9882326722145081;it was noted that monetary policy action particularly in the area of sovereign bond purchases could not be seen in isolation from the actions of other policy actors
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9890224933624268;possible moral hazard implications for euro area governments could weaken their incentives for structural reforms and fiscal consolidation
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9911405444145203;hence there was broad agreement that the effectiveness of sovereign bond purchases would also depend on the appropriate action on the part of other policymakers in the euro area
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9302794337272644;growthfriendly fiscal policies while fully respecting existing commitments were seen as an effective instrument to support economic growth in the euro area at the current juncture

2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9829555749893188;this would not only raise the euro areas longterm growth prospects but would also reinforce the positive effects of any monetary policy measures on economic growth and inflation developments
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9667378664016724;these were strong messages to be conveyed to euro area governments and the european commission
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9864349365234375;it was also noted that the governing council had to be wary of possible financial stability ramifications which could arise from intervening in already generously priced markets
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9886619448661804;spillovers from sovereign bond purchases not only into corporate bond prices but also into equity prices could trigger the mispricing of risk and feed financial market exuberance with potential destabilising effects on financial markets
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9907686114311218;at the same time it was remarked that this should be addressed by macroprudential policy
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9912030696868896;members discussed the appropriate modalities of risk sharing related to the purchases of securities issued by euro area governments and agencies and european institutions
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Negative;0.7073512077331543;on the one hand arguments were made in favour of full risk sharing so as to counter perceptions of a lack of unity
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9822571873664856;full risk sharing would also underline the singleness of monetary policy
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9076415300369263;on the other hand in view of concerns about moral hazard it was argued that a regime of partial loss sharing would be more commensurate with the current architecture of economic and monetary union and the treaties under which the ecb operates
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9727674126625061;weighing all the arguments a consensus could be reached on the following approach
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9899154901504517;the purchases of european institutions securities conducted by the ncbs amounting to 12 of the additional asset purchases would be subject to full risk sharing
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9934930205345154;it was also proposed that the ecb would conduct 8 of the additional purchases which was in accordance with past practice and the standard way of implementing monetary policy by the eurosystem
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9540942907333374;the rest of the ncbs additional asset purchases would not be subject to loss sharing
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9821513891220093;this implied that 20 of the additional asset purchases would be subject to a regime of risk sharing
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9442406296730042;as regards the volume of the programme a pace of combined monthly asset purchases in the order of 50 billion lasting from march 2015 to end2016 which had been mentioned by mr praet was widely regarded as a sizeable complement to the existing purchase programmes
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Negative;0.6731463074684143;this was seen as needed to compensate for the weakened inflation outlook coupled with the weaker than expected monetary stimulus provided by the monetary policy measures taken in june and september 2014 in order to accelerate the impact there was broad support in favour of some frontloading by increasing the monthly purchase volume to 60 billion starting in march 2015 and intended to last until the end of september 2016 while not materially altering the overall volume of intended purchases
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9873998165130615;this would comprise the purchase of public sector securities as well as the private sector programmes that were already in operation
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9922387003898621;at the same time members agreed to make the termination of purchases contingent on the evolving path of inflation being consistent with the governing councils price stability objective
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9452787637710571;this provided an important element of forward guidance
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9891045093536377;as a further complement to the expanded asset purchase programme the proposal to adapt the terms and conditions applied to the remaining six tltros by eliminating the spread of 10 basis points over the prevailing rate on the main refinancing operations was widely supported the governing council discussed the technical design features of a sovereign bond purchase programme as presented earlier
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9931220412254333;with regard to the universe of purchasable assets it was agreed that the programme would include purchases of securities of central government certain agencies established in the euro area and certain international or supranational institutions located in the euro area
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9812837243080139;it was viewed as important to restrict purchases to investmentgrade securities namely those with a firstbest rating of at least cqs3 in line with the collateral eligibility criteria applied in the eurosystems credit operations
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9858907461166382;this however did not imply the a priori exclusion of particular euro area countries from the additional sovereign bond purchases
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9901236891746521;a rating derogation was to be granted in line with the earlier practice with regard to the abspp and cbpp3 and as long as the eurosystems minimum credit quality threshold was not applied in the eurosystems credit operations for countries under euimf adjustment programmes
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9748625159263611;moreover in line with past practice the rating derogation would be subject to some additional eligibility criteria and limit adjustments aimed at achieving risk equivalence
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9900102019309998;there was broad agreement on conducting the additional purchases of securities according to eurosystem ncbs shares in the ecbs capital key
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9218551516532898;regarding the residual maturity of the sovereign bonds to be purchased there was broad agreement that a residual maturity of two to thirty years would strike a good balance between ensuring an appropriate universe of purchasable sovereign bonds and limiting the risks of market distortions and the crowdingout of investors in the longermaturity segment
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9553037285804749;as regards the issue limit broad agreement prevailed that an issue share limit would ensure proper market functioning counter monetary financing concerns and safeguard pari passu treatment
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9868805408477783;an issue share limit of 25 needed to be applied in order to avoid obtaining a blocking minority in a debt restructuring involving collective action clauses
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9850377440452576;therefore this issue limit also comprised the existing eurosystem holdings of sovereign bonds in the context of the securities markets programme and any other portfolios owned by eurosystem central banks
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9760218262672424;likewise the issuer limit of 33 was broadly supported as a means to safeguard market functioning and price formation as well as to mitigate the risk of the ecb becoming a dominant creditor of euro area governments
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9891791343688965;to this end it was judged appropriate to apply the 33 limit to the universe of eligible assets in the two to thirtyyear range of residual maturity
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9624200463294983;moreover to ensure compliance with the monetary financing prohibition laid down in the treaty the application of an appropriate blackout period was viewed as important
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9871973991394043;monetary policy decisions and communication against this background and taking into account the views expressed by the members of the governing council the president concluded that a large majority of voting members supported a decision to launch an expanded asset purchase programme comprising the existing purchase programmes for abs and covered bonds as well as purchases of eurodenominated securities issued by euro area governments and agencies and supranational institutions
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9944766163825989;this programme would start in march 2015 and involve monthly purchases of 60 billion which were intended to last until the end of september 2016 and in any case until the governing council saw a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with the aim of achieving inflation rates below but close to 2
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9854943752288818;as regards the risksharing regime the consensus reached was that 20 of the overall additional asset purchases would be subject to sharing of hypothetical losses
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9844224452972412;this included the sharing of possible losses on the ncb purchases of the bonds of supranational institutions amounting to 12 of the additional asset purchases as well as the sharing of possible losses on the 8 holdings of the additional purchases by the ecb
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9918622970581055;in addition it was decided to set the interest rate for the remaining six tltros at a rate equal to the rate on the eurosystems main refinancing operations prevailing at the time when each tltro was conducted
2015-02-19;2015;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9886453151702881;finally with regard to interest rates the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility would remain unchanged at 005 030 and 020 respectively
