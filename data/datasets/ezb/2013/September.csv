2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Positive;0.9754903316497803;in order to ensure an adequate transmission of monetary policy to the financing conditions in euro area countries it is essential that the fragmentation of euro area credit markets declines further and that the resilience of banks is strengthened where needed
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Positive;0.8518850803375244;further decisive steps to establish a banking union will help to accomplish this objective

2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9876242876052856;as regards fiscal policies governments should not unravel their efforts to reduce deficits and put debt ratios on a downward path

2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Positive;0.9704751968383789;in terms of economic policies product market reforms to increase competitiveness will facilitate the creation of new businesses support the tradable goods sector and foster job creation while high unemployment rates require decisive structural reforms to reduce rigidities in labour markets and to increase labour demand
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9252848029136658;i am now at your disposal for questions
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Negative;0.513553261756897;question you mentioned that if excess liquidity declines much further youd be particularly attentive to developments in that regard
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.7750592827796936;could you help us by perhaps indicating at what point numerically excess liquidity becomes a concern to you and what then you would do about that
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.72772216796875;   and my second question is about the renewed tensions in the middle east if it transpired that there was an oil price spike which has happened in the past of course does that endanger your forward guidance outlook or would an oil price spike be something you would be inclined to look through
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8635343909263611;draghi you are absolutely right to have focused on that sentence particularly attentive
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.88741135597229;right now we view the current excess liquidity as adequate but we stand ready to act
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8539147973060608;now we have got to be aware that excess liquidity depends on two factors
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.7255409359931946;the less fragmentation there is the less is the excess liquidity
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9465009570121765;the second factor is a reaction to the excess liquidity and to the demand namely through ltros
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9669272303581238;so now we are down from 800 billion to 250 billion in terms of excess liquidity and that is all in all good news because it means that fragmentation has been receding
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9730163216590881;now when we come to the relation between the excess liquidity and the eonia rates  which is what you are really asking  we have to consider that this relation is unstable in the sense that there isnt any precise figure
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.937934935092926;i remember some time ago i mentioned a figure of 200 billion as the threshold but in fact it is really contextdependent
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.7976031303405762;it depends on the context it depends on the degree of fragmentation that we have
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9868099689483643;the ecbs monthly bulletin speaks of a figure between 200 billion and 100 billion but in general the threshold depends on the state of fragmentation
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9614364504814148;the other note of caution that i would sound is that one should not extrapolate too much from the past repayment pattern of ltros
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9831928014755249;as you see from the figures it has been quite significant for some time and now it is basically constant
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9080195426940918;it really depends on who is repaying the ltro what is the state of their funding conditions what is the state of their profitability what is their general situation
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9586925506591797;so i wouldnt extrapolate too much from this repayment pattern saying that in a months time this figure of 250 billion would go down to 200 billion or whatever
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9671711325645447;second i would say that there isnt any stable relation between the figure the threshold and the rates
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9658808708190918;in any event we would  as i said  stand ready to take appropriate action as needed
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9819350242614746;obviously  i already said this several times  we have the fixed rate full allotment policy in place until at least july 2014 and for as long as needed
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8987683653831482;on the second question we will have to see really
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9810194373130798;in general as you know our reference is hicp inflation
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9379768967628479;we have to see whether this would alter our mediumterm forecast for inflation
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Negative;0.7945975661277771;as i mentioned before risks to inflation are broadly balanced and one of the risks is precisely shocks in commodity prices
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9583494663238525;we will have to assess this but the rate at which we look is headline inflation
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.7452778816223145;question my first question is whether have you discussed a rate cut today and my second question is on market interest rates
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9460662007331848;you have raised concerns about the level of the market interest rates in july and i just wonder whether you feel comfortable with the level right now
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8731216788291931;draghi on the question of an interest rate cut there was a discussion like we do all the time
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9854835867881775;we do discuss the state of our monetary policy stance each point in time and we discuss interest rates and other monetary policy instruments
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.6326044201850891;some governors of course observed that improvements in the economy would not justify this discussion
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9937852621078491;but several other governors observed that the recovery is still too green if you look at it slack is still wide weak credit weak monetary aggregates inflation is subdued in the mediumterm unemployment is still high
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.981410562992096;it was too green to exclude this discussion and if money market developments  and here i am answering to the second question really  if money market developments were to be judged unwarranted in their impact on our assessment of mediumterm inflation then such an instrument should be considered
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9781181216239929;question just on that second answer you gave last month you said that the rate hike expectations embedded in the money markets were unwarranted
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.7683058381080627;is that still your assessment and if it is then why didnt you cut rates today
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9415790438652039;and my second question more broadly is is there a risk that the ecb is trying to finetune the markets too much
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.7601203918457031;is there anything wrong given the context of the eurozone and the global economy for investors to say a couple of years down the line there might be a single rate hike from crisislow near zero levels
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8621328473091125;draghi interest rates move for a variety of reasons
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.4874078035354614;some of them have to do with the news related to the improvements in the economy
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9664918184280396;in this case the forward guidance we have expressed is just geared to make sure to reach two objectives
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9004921913146973;the first is to reduce the volatility within the corridor which we have succeeded in doing
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8380196690559387;the second objective is to make sure that this news relative to the improvements in the economy do not cause overreaction in the market interest rates
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Positive;0.665239691734314;and on that ground we had been moderately successful
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9847269058227539;and i would refer for an analysis and a comparison of different forward guidance concepts to a very recent and very interesting paper by the bank for international settlements
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8625055551528931;then there is another set of news that comes that has nothing to do with the euro fundamentals
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.6888019442558289;and it may come from all over in which case the forward guidance is meant to make sure that you want to look through this news to make sure that their impact on the mediumterm assessment of inflation is contained question europe is picking up but the netherlands is still in recession and the dutch people think that is because of austerity measures
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Negative;0.931688666343689;what do you think is the main reason that the dutch economy is lagging behind
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.757398784160614;my second question would be that there are new austerity measures coming up 6 billion
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.960358202457428;one third will be tax increases
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.5050237774848938;do you think that the netherlands is on the right track to recovery
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.818821907043457;and i know im stretching it a bit but i have third question
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9776477813720703;the dutch government has decided not to privatise abn amro for another year two of our four big banks are nationalised
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.874022364616394;i was wondering in general what your vision is on state ownership of a bank
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.7799075841903687;what does that do to the competitiveness of the sector
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9022515416145325;graeff before we answer we have a rule of two questions
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9684644937515259;so would you please pick the two most important ones
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9213143587112427;journalist the first two
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9792189002037048;draghi i would say that the netherlands is undergoing a protracted domestic demanddriven recession and you know that the household sector is heavily indebted
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9932257533073425;there are financial sector challenges declining real estate prices and all this weighs on domestic demand
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.6663037538528442;so in this environment deleveraging by households and by banks is natural
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9899150133132935;however the recent data show a decelerating pace of the contraction with some signs of recovery in business investments and some stabilisation of exports
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Positive;0.9808509349822998;so there are also positive signals coming from the latest survey
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Positive;0.9886531233787537;industrial confidence has improved in recent months manufacturing pmi has climbed into positive growth territory
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Positive;0.9563841819763184;so i would expect a gradual pickup of the economy
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9880032539367676;however the mediumterm outlook remains subdued as with other members of the euro area

2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Negative;0.7065430879592896;but we have to keep in mind one thing is the design of what can come out of this effort another thing is the overcoming of the regulatory hurdles which make the use of abs quite difficult at the present time
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9590499997138977;question mr draghi but have the exact criteria for the balance sheet assessment already been defined by the governing council and if so what is the outcome

2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.962196946144104;so for the time being i can only tell you that there are many people who are working on this  all the 17 national supervisors and their teams and the ecb are working on this
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9417990446090698;there isnt anything precise that i can report at this stage
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.7342204451560974;question mr draghi a followup to the question on banking union
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.986163318157196;yesterday mr asmussen said very explicitly that if a bank should be resolved this should be decided by the ecb and implicitly not by the european commission
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.719390332698822;i wonder if you agree with this position which is a very clear position
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.750968873500824;and my second question is on greece
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.946947455406189;there has been a discussion especially in germany about an eventual third package for after the elections
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.5754231214523315;i wonder if the ecb is of the same opinion that greece will need help again
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9490067958831787;draghi on the first point i think there has been a misunderstanding
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9794303178787231;i dont think mr asmussen has ever said that and there has been confusion
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9864906072616577;the view that we have is the following the supervisor makes the assessment  and thats by the way how these things usually go in most member countries nowadays  the supervisor makes the assessment in total independence and then hands this assessment to the resolution authority which nowadays in many member countries is the government
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.948699414730072;and then the government decides what it wants to do
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9622973799705505;the supervisor cannot decide what to do whether to resolve or sell the bank or whatever
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8820952773094177;its not its responsibility
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9780920147895813;and this is what mr asmussen said  so hes been misinterpreted
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Negative;0.4995463490486145;there is no confusion on this point
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9553071856498718;the line is pretty clear
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9826364517211914;and by the way we have also seen that there was a misunderstanding about what the bundesbank thinks
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9794982075691223;the bundesbank agrees 100 with this view
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9735285043716431;this is how supervisors work in all countries
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9696519374847412;supervisors cant have responsibilities that pertain or may pertain to the taxpayer
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9787523150444031;so the supervisor makes the assessment and passes it on saying look this bank is not viable under the present circumstances
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.975343644618988;you have to do something but its up to you to decide what to do on the second point on greece the current adjustment programme for greece expires at the end of 2014 so this leaves some time for the eurogroup to decide on a possible extension of the current programme and to assess the prospects of greece regaining access to capital markets
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9682263731956482;its also quite straightforward if an extension of the programme is needed it will require further conditionality
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.7227686643600464;question i just have a specific question regarding ireland
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9494548439979553;it intends to be the first country to exit a bailout at the end of this year

2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9090974926948547;a key consideration is that the conditions remain in place for a successful conclusion of the current programme
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.7117072343826294;and ireland is leading the way in this respect
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9531489610671997;it is crucial that an appropriate framework is in place to safeguard the achievements made and to avoid potential risks to full market access once the programme has been completed
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9593315720558167;question just as you said there in the previous question greece has another whole year until the end of 2014 for its programme to finish
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9375733137130737;but in ireland we are talking about a couple of months
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.7627448439598083;do you think it is imperative that a decision is made on a strategy for exiting the bailout quite soon in the next two months
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.973401665687561;draghi that is up to the eurogroup to decide
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Negative;0.5198061466217041;question not to go on about greece too much but there has also been a lot of talk about whether there should be some kind of debt relief and i wonder if i could just push you a little bit more on that
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9196203947067261;is there anything you can say about whether that is something the ecb would consider in the light of the fact that you are major holders of greek bonds
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.7384752035140991;draghi well the answer is no
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9399925470352173;we went through this when we had the discussions about greece almost a year or a year and a half ago
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.7370745539665222;it is pretty clear that we cannot undertake monetary financing
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9791130423545837;article 123 of the treaty forbids the ecb from undertaking monetary financing
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9515816569328308;question there are some critics saying that the ecb is responsible for the crisis in some savings banks because of the low interest rates which by the way also contribute to the expropriation of savings
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.5579819083213806;could you please comment on this because it is very much debated especially here in germany
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9457896947860718;is the ecb reflecting on the fact that with high debt and countries coming out weak from recession a midterm inflation target is not enough to get out of the crisis and there are some economists who suggest that you should also link it to unemployment as the federal reserve system does
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9422934055328369;draghi the answer to the second question is pretty straightforward
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9512805938720703;our mandate talks about price stability and that is our objective price stability in the medium term
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.991664707660675;on the first point the ecb sets rates for the whole of the euro area
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8655081391334534;we see no inflation in germany
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9770234227180481;are interest rates low because the ecbs rates are low
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9787095785140991;for the answer just look at what happened to the interest rates on the tenyear bund in the last month or so
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.972044050693512;it went up by about 50 basis points to slightly less than 2 and our rates had simply stayed the same
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8446613550186157;actually they were cut a month and a half ago
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.983658492565155;this relationship between our rates and rates on the bund has to be looked at quite closely and it is not at all a direct relationship
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.49164652824401855;as a matter of fact there is another factor that plays into keeping interest rates artificially low in germany and the netherlands and in some other countries as well
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.568207859992981;it is the fact that we have fragmentation and these countries have become the safe haven for the euro area
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8639141321182251;for about three years we have had flows pouring into these countries keeping interest rates artificially low
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8716356158256531;everything we have done to reduce fragmentation actually contributes to higher and more realistic rates in these countries and this should be acknowledged
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8350134491920471;question mr draghi i have got 2 questions
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9235628843307495;one is related to you announced last time on this press conference that you would put forward a proposal on minutes and i would like to hear if something like this was discussed and what the state of this discussion is
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.779460608959198;second question is on german politics
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8625983595848083;are you watching the outcome of the general elections coming this month
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Negative;0.5478931069374084;and do you think that this can have an impact on the economy
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9285704493522644;draghi on the second question i have to give you a very general answer
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9604775309562683;often elections have an impact on the economy but i cannot comment on the specifics of this election
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9604438543319702;on the first question actually if i am correct i did not use the word minutes
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9683010578155518;i think i used the word an account of our discussions
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9250831007957458;work is going on and as i have said it is important it could  if its well done  it could actually give more light and transparency on the nature of our discussions
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9733101725578308;but it is quite important to acknowledge that our setup our institutional setup is not the same as the us or the uk or japan
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8732424378395081;we are a 17 countries monetary union
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9512994289398193;and so the governors are there in their personal responsibility and they should remain independent in their decisionmaking
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.7471560835838318;and so anything that would threaten their independence would not be acceptable
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.6636431217193604;so transparency while keeping their independence
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9776979088783264;question inaudible interjection draghi we said yes i think i did say that the executive board would present a proposal in the fall
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.960648775100708;question the spanish programme for the banking system is going to expire next january
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9774963855743408;do you support an extension for the programme or another form of backstop or insurance for the spanish banking system

2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Positive;0.9863786697387695;some banks have made steady progress in reducing their dependence on wholesale funding under the eurosystem
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9191710948944092;as you know spanish banks have repaid a substantive amount
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9529237747192383;so the reform of the savings banks has been comprehensive
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9672316908836365;there are a few issues that remain but they are likely to be resolved without any major impact on the liquidity or solvency of the spanish banks
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Negative;0.8770825862884521;question while i do not want to overdramatise what is going on in st petersburg the market has become quite sensitive to news flow over syria
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Negative;0.7143877744674683;that is one of the potential geopolitical downside risks that you have acknowledged i think
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9947490096092224;in the medium term there is also a growing concern about the emerging market slowdown and the deficit currencies
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9180991053581238;so my twopronged question is what specific responses have been discussed within the governing council to ease any market distress on either of these issues and have you spoken to or communicated with the federal reserve or other central banks about the prospect of coordinated action should it be necessary
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.7645874619483948;draghi we certainly are alert to the geopolitical risk that may come out of the syrian situation and to the economic risk that may derive from the emerging market situation which are two different things really
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9349938631057739;at this point i should say something i should have said before
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Negative;0.992268979549408;as you can observe when we look at the nature or the composition of the beginning of a recovery i am very very cautious about the recovery
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8011491298675537;i cannot share any enthusiasm
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9584362506866455;it is just the beginning
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Negative;0.8512080907821655;let us see  these shoots are still very very green
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.4962352514266968;one thing i should have said is that for the first time in about two years it is domestic demand that is at the root of this recovery
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8956844806671143;it is still coupled with exports but it is domestic demand
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9437559843063354;that is very important because if it continues it gives a sense that the dependence of the recovery on the rest of the world is somewhat balanced by domestic demand
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9515649080276489;secondly we certainly stand ready to act
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8324753046035767;i did say this when i was asked about what we would do if interest rate or money market developments were unwarranted in view of our assessment of mediumterm price stability

2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9712797403335571;one of them will be this weekend in basel

2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9289395213127136;question was there any discussion today on the governing council about a more explicit version of your forward guidance
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9372472763061523;you seem to be dipping your toes into giving us a fuller account by talking earlier about various governors saying this and that
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9534454941749573;so if you could answer the question that way that would be brilliant
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.879500150680542;and the second question is as a former amsterdam correspondent i enjoyed your answer about holland just now
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9139413833618164;i was wondering whether you could give us a similar sort of tour dhorizon about the situation in italy or is that a country you fundamentally will not talk about
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8860234022140503;and i say that because our italian colleagues do not seem to be here today
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8171593546867371;draghi i would rather not comment on the second question
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9030676484107971;i think you will understand why
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9288147687911987;so i think you will have to rely on someone else to have this tour dhorizon for italy
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9608407616615295;but on the first question we have of course reflected on the nature of our forward guidance
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9414042830467224;and we have asked ourselves what the objectives are of forward guidance
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9852343201637268;forward guidance contains an assessment by a central bank of its view of the future and contains information about its policy response for the future
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9494692087173462;i think that is the essence of forward guidance
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9824308753013611;it is not a change in our reaction function but rather an explanation of our reaction function
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.7934479117393494;we wanted to be clear
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8439833521842957;we do not want to change it
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9878138303756714;there are two types of forward guidance one is qualitative and the other one is quantitative with precise state conditions
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9611271023750305;ours is the first type
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.973876416683197;so all in all the governing council is fairly united  unanimous actually  on the wish to maintain this type of forward guidance
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9736749529838562;i have previously mentioned the bis paper which actually compares the results and levels of success of different types of forward guidance
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9399851560592651;as i have said before the ecb does not score too badly
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Positive;0.8711634278297424;it scores very well on having controlled volatility and reduced the uncertainty within the corridor and it scores ok in controlling the levels of rates
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.7067404389381409;but as i have said there is a continuous flow of news on rates
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9559419751167297;so given our specific institutional setup the qualitative forward guidance that we have used is the most appropriate and you can easily see why a different type of forward guidance would create problems within our institutional setup if we were to be willing to adopt a precise formulation a quantitative formulation which we are not
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.920950174331665;question there is no change in the reaction function
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9503855109214783;does that mean that essentially you would do nothing different if there was no forward guidance
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.7250704169273376;draghi no because we basically said that looking at the mediumterm outlook for inflation way beyond the short term we wanted to make it clear that we have a downward bias in interest rates for an extended period of time
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9246003031730652;i think that is the essence and is something we have never said before
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.6978346705436707;so the very fact of saying it is itself a very powerful clarification of our reaction function
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8736357688903809;question my first question is also on forward guidance but on a different issue
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Negative;0.92377108335495;at the end of the press conference in july you said that you would all agree that low levels of interest rates entail serious risks to financial stability although there is no reference to financial stability in your forward guidance
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9671686887741089;however the bank of england for example explicitly mentions such risks as one of the free knockouts for its forward guidance
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.7340889573097229;so the question is why is there no mention of financial stability risks in your forward guidance and to be more precise what would happen or what would be the reaction of the ecb if such risks emerge while the mediumterm inflation outlook is still very subdued
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9751001596450806;and the second question is on the resolution issue just to clarify you said that the ecb will make an assessment and hand it to the governments if lets say they are the resolution authority and leave it up to them to decide
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9734869599342346;does that mean we could get into a situation where the ecb says ok this bank is a case for resolution but the authority says no we have a different view
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.7157515287399292;what would happen in that case
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9690091013908386;draghi in response to your second question the practice for i would say almost all if not all supervisors in the euro area is the following
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.973243772983551;it is the supervisors who look at the viability of a bank in a certain situation
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9773843288421631;if they were to decide that the bank is not viable then they would simply communicate this to the authority which has the responsibility to  well first of all there is what is called supervisory action namely the bank would be asked to raise capital sell assets do a bailin and so on
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9431048035621643;but suppose you have exhausted all these options or you simply judge that the bank is unviable no matter what supervisory action is undertaken
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.973970353603363;in that case you hand the bank to the resolution authority which is often the government but is often separate
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9882588386535645;in our proposed legislation it will be a separate entity whether it is the commission or another authority is not clear yet
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9689512252807617;and they will decide what to do because it is up to them as they are using or may be using public money or they may be considering that the further bailin could be feasible
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9831810593605042;but the assessment is made by the supervisor
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9914923310279846;the actions required to respond to this assessment would be decided upon by the independent authority
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.971160888671875;and that is pretty clear and that has been the view of the ecb
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.615675687789917;your second question is about financial stability
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9783425331115723;first of all financial stability risks are often addressed by macroprudential tools
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9736073613166809;that is what we have in mind and it is actually part of the ssm creation
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.7870148420333862;we do not view now movements in interest rates as a realistic way to respond to risks in financial stability that we do not see
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Negative;0.8773831129074097;in other words we do not see risks to financial stability that may originate from the too low levels of interest rates at the present time
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8655319809913635;but certainly if there were a situation like we had in the past we would have to think about it and react
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9384480714797974;in the past we did not have such a subdued mediumterm outlook of inflation as we are seeing now
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8573968410491943;question i wonder if you could tell us what consideration  if any  the governing council has given to ways of cementing the forward guidance perhaps releasing inflation forecasts into 2015 or other methods that might give the market more comfort with respect to the forward guidance given the market differentials that we are seeing  not only for yourselves but also for other central banks
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9643229842185974;draghi i think that is a legitimate question and the inflation forecast for 2015 will be published at the end of the year when the next projections are announced
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8024324774742126;question my question is on omts
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9615246057510376;just one year ago you announced the details of these measures
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9375013113021851;what is interesting for me is why this measure is so effective without being activated
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9885995388031006;other central banks  for example the bank of japan and the federal reserve  have introduced similar programmes but they have needed to be activated in order to be effective
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8892101645469666;so my question is why is it that only in the euro area has such a programme been effective without being activated
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.6370454430580139;draghi well its very hard to answer this question without flattering oneself
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.5444140434265137;but i suspect that the design of this measure has made it both powerful and credible
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9673033952713013;its powerful because it addresses a realistic objective namely redenomination risk spreads  the spreads that are derived from redenomination risks
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9508321285247803;its credible because it is accompanied by conditionality
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.7467572689056396;in our present situation and in many others i suspect a commitment to buy an infinite amount of bonds in order to keep interest rates at a certain level is often not credible  besides being illegal in our present situation
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9648288488388062;so i think this combination of a realistic target accompanied by what are in principle unlimited means but are in fact limited by the markets size and by conditionality has made this measure very effective without it needing to be activated
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9732869267463684;but conditionality is an important ingredient because it says that once this measure is activated the country that is on the receiving end will actually be undertaking a series of actions  budgetary consolidation or structural reforms or both  that will have the effect of increasing the value of the bonds issued by that country the value of the very bonds that the ecb is buying into it
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9855786561965942;so the conditionality if properly activated produces an increase in the value  if you want to use that word  of the collateral that the country posts in exchange for ecb action
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9055163860321045;i think thats one way to look at this
2013-09-05;2013;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.5181067585945129;thanks for asking
