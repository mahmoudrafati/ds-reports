2003-07-10;2003;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9904419183731079;this should be supported by lower inflation and thus higher real disposable income the low level of interest rates and a recovery in external demand for euro area goods and services
2003-07-10;2003;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9612302184104919;this assessment is in line with all available forecasts and projections
2003-07-10;2003;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9672060608863831;nevertheless downside risks to this main scenario are still relevant

2003-07-10;2003;July;REPORT;Negative;0.7963095307350159;in early 2004 a significant base effect related to energy prices should lead to a marked fall in annual hicp inflation rates assuming broadly unchanged oil prices and exchange rates
2003-07-10;2003;July;REPORT;Negative;0.919539749622345;subsequently the exchange rate passthrough and a moderate economic recovery should contain price pressures
2003-07-10;2003;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.6718354225158691;in this respect wage developments in particular are expected to remain consistent with a favourable outlook for price stability
2003-07-10;2003;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9658014178276062;other price indicators such as developments in producer prices tend to support this picture
2003-07-10;2003;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.990497350692749;moreover all available forecasts and projections as well as indicators of inflation expectations point in the same direction namely that price stability in line with our aim of inflation below but close to 2 will be maintained over the medium term
2003-07-10;2003;July;REPORT;Positive;0.7064881324768066;in the context of our monetary analysis substantial excess liquidity has accumulated in the euro area as a consequence of the extended period of high m3 growth
2003-07-10;2003;July;REPORT;Positive;0.98325115442276;this strong growth has continued in recent months as economic uncertainty and the low level of interest rates across the whole maturity spectrum have increased the attractiveness of holding liquid assets
2003-07-10;2003;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9884849786758423;at the same time the low level of interest rates has helped support recent growth in loans to the private sector
2003-07-10;2003;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.964672327041626;while the large amount of excess liquidity should be less of a concern in a period of moderate economic activity monetary developments need to be closely monitored in terms of their implications for price stability over the medium to long term
2003-07-10;2003;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9656647443771362;to sum up our economic analysis confirms the expectation that price dynamics will remain moderate in the euro area in the context of a gradual economic recovery and the strengthened euro exchange rate
2003-07-10;2003;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9777696132659912;the monetary analysis indicates that the strong expansion of m3 should for the time being not be seen as adversely affecting this outlook
2003-07-10;2003;July;REPORT;Negative;0.5737236738204956;hence crosschecking the information from the two pillars leads to the conclusion that the outlook for price stability over the medium term remains favourable
2003-07-10;2003;July;REPORT;Positive;0.992476761341095;with mediumterm inflation expectations firmly anchored at levels consistent with price stability and with interest rates at historical lows monetary policy has made a significant contribution to improving the conditions for a recovery in economic growth

2003-07-10;2003;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9931514263153076;part of the weakness in economic growth in the euro area can be linked to a lack of ambition in the areas of fiscal and structural reform to further improve the conditions for investment and employment
2003-07-10;2003;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9913097620010376;a strong commitment to the stability and growth pact and adherence to well designed mediumterm fiscal consolidation strategies in those countries currently struggling with increasing fiscal imbalances would make a major contribution to improving confidence
2003-07-10;2003;July;REPORT;Negative;0.8828297853469849;in a similar way progress in structural reforms in the labour and product markets would not only increase the euro areas growth potential and enhance its ability to better withstand external shocks but it would also eliminate a great deal of the uncertainty currently clouding longterm planning and prospects
2003-07-10;2003;July;REPORT;Positive;0.7755646705627441;in the current situation characterised by subdued economic growth and low confidence structural reform and a steady and reliable course of fiscal policy in line with the european fiscal framework are of the highest priority
