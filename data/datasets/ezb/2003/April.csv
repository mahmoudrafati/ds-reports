2003-04-03;2003;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9739015102386475;as regards the analysis under the first pillar of our monetary policy strategy the threemonth average of the annual growth rate of m3 was 74 in the period from december 2002 to february 2003 up from 70 in the period from november 2002 to january 2003 given the continued high volatility in financial markets mainly related to the geopolitical uncertainty m3 growth continued to be fostered by portfolio shifts away from more risky assets
2003-04-03;2003;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9894101619720459;however m3 growth appears also to have been affected by the low level of shortterm interest rates prevailing in the euro area as indicated by the strong growth in its most liquid components

2003-04-03;2003;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9838137626647949;as a result we should only expect a modest rate of economic growth for 2003 however the evolution of economic growth for the rest of this year is particularly difficult to foresee at the moment given the exceptional degree of uncertainty arising from the military conflict
2003-04-03;2003;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9164848923683167;our baseline scenario continues to be one of a moderate recovery associated with diminishing uncertainty starting in the second half of 2003 however we will need to review the economic implications of the war as soon as a clearer picture emerges
2003-04-03;2003;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9730461239814758;a number of scenarios implying widely different outcomes for economic activity are conceivable at present

2003-04-03;2003;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9603685736656189;as for the outlook for price stability over the medium term it is particularly important to clearly distinguish between shortterm volatility and more fundamental factors
2003-04-03;2003;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.7853697538375854;while oil price developments may very much influence the pattern of inflation rates over the coming months other factors should dominate beyond the short term
2003-04-03;2003;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9876435995101929;the lagged effects of the appreciation of the euro exchange rate since mid2002 will continue to dampen upward pressure on prices as will the modest economic growth
2003-04-03;2003;April;REPORT;Negative;0.7187404036521912;if the recent significant reduction in oil prices is sustained inflation rates will in all likelihood fall below 2 in the course of 2003 and remain in line with price stability thereafter evidently this presupposes that wage moderation prevails
