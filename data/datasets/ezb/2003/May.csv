2003-05-08;2003;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9712421894073486;you will also note that as a consequence of the conclusions we reached i have restructured todays introductory statement somewhat and i will be following this new structure in the future
2003-05-08;2003;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.981871485710144;the introductory statement will henceforth present first economic analysis followed by monetary analysis
2003-05-08;2003;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9893677830696106;it concludes by crosschecking the analyses conducted under these two pillars
2003-05-08;2003;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9749214053153992;turning now to our discussion of monetary policy we have decided to keep our key interest rates unchanged
2003-05-08;2003;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9553098082542419;taking due account of new economic and monetary information as well as the latest geopolitical developments we concluded that the current monetary policy stance remains consistent with the preservation of price stability over the medium term
2003-05-08;2003;May;REPORT;Positive;0.7819159626960754;at the same time it maintains a monetary environment that is conducive to economic growth
2003-05-08;2003;May;REPORT;Negative;0.6337758898735046;with the end of the military action in iraq important downside risks to the economic recovery have diminished and our focus is now again on the other forces that have been shaping the economic outlook
2003-05-08;2003;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9887791872024536;the governing council will carefully monitor future developments and assess whether conditions for price stability continue to develop favourably
2003-05-08;2003;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9530407190322876;let me explain our assessment in detail
2003-05-08;2003;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9947777986526489;in the context of our economic analysis focusing on the short to medium term recently published survey data and the latest information from conjunctural indicators suggest that economic activity in the euro area has remained subdued so far this year
2003-05-08;2003;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9881125092506409;looking ahead we continue to expect a gradual strengthening of real gdp growth to start later in 2003 and to gather more pace in the course of next year
2003-05-08;2003;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9909212589263916;factors supporting this outlook are an expected recovery of global demand the prospect of falling inflation benefiting real disposable income growth and the low level of interest rates
2003-05-08;2003;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9901331663131714;moreover the recent unwinding of uncertainties associated with geopolitical tensions should contribute to an economic recovery
2003-05-08;2003;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9835594296455383;such an assessment also seems to be reflected in recent financial market reactions
2003-05-08;2003;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9813892245292664;since the end of the war in iraq financial market volatility has declined significantly with a notable increase in stock prices
2003-05-08;2003;May;REPORT;Negative;0.988922119140625;nevertheless there continue to be downside risks
2003-05-08;2003;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9891083240509033;first there are the risks originating from the past accumulation of macroeconomic imbalances outside the euro area and lately concerns have arisen with regard to the sars virus
2003-05-08;2003;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9889312386512756;moreover there is also some uncertainty over the extent of the adjustment still needed in the euro area corporate sector in order to enhance productivity and profitability which could have an impact on employment growth and thus private consumption
2003-05-08;2003;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9404106736183167;as regards price developments the annual rate of hicp inflation generally fluctuated at around 2324 between the autumn of last year and march 2003 broadly speaking declining inflation rates in services and nonenergy industrial goods have been offset by rising rates in energy and processed food prices
2003-05-08;2003;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.5993284583091736;conversely in april energy prices are expected to reflect the decline in oil prices following the developments in iraq
2003-05-08;2003;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9884516000747681;this expectation is in line with eurostats flash estimate for the inflation rate in april which was 21 ie
2003-05-08;2003;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.5051059722900391;03 percentage point lower than in march
2003-05-08;2003;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9578718543052673;looking ahead current indications do not point to further strong declines in the inflation rate in the immediate future but lower oil prices an environment of moderate economic growth and of course the effects of the significantly higher exchange rate of the euro should all contribute to reducing inflationary pressure beyond the short term
2003-05-08;2003;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9698821902275085;the outlook for inflation will also depend to a significant extent on wage developments
2003-05-08;2003;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9578890800476074;the available indicators suggest that labour cost growth has shown signs of stabilising in the course of 2002 moderate wage trends are indeed crucial both to maintain price stability and to foster employment growth
2003-05-08;2003;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9774255156517029;in the context of our monetary analysis focusing on the medium to long term the broad monetary aggregate m3 has now been growing strongly over a protracted period
2003-05-08;2003;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.5706793665885925;moreover the data for more recent months do not suggest that a process of correction has started
2003-05-08;2003;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9907112717628479;as a consequence the euro area economy continued to accumulate liquidity significantly above the amount needed to sustain noninflationary growth the strong monetary expansion contrasted with the more moderate growth in loans to the private sector
2003-05-08;2003;May;REPORT;Positive;0.8704308271408081;this is consistent with our assessment that monetary developments continue to be fostered by portfolio shifts reflecting a sustained preference on the part of investors for liquid and secure assets in an environment of high uncertainty
2003-05-08;2003;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9914222359657288;however the low level of interest rates has also contributed to strong monetary growth
2003-05-08;2003;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.7769982814788818;when interpreting monetary trends particular account needs to be taken of the portfolio shifts towards increased demand for monetary assets for precautionary reasons
2003-05-08;2003;May;REPORT;Positive;0.929096519947052;the reduction in geopolitical tensions should support an unwinding of these portfolio shifts
2003-05-08;2003;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9853647351264954;a reversal in monetary trends would in any case dampen the concerns regarding the medium to longterm implications of recent monetary dynamics
2003-05-08;2003;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9754922389984131;as a consequence monetary developments will continue to be monitored closely
2003-05-08;2003;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9588993787765503;overall it currently appears that inflation rates should decline to below 2 over the medium term in particular given the outlook for economic activity and the significant appreciation of the euro
2003-05-08;2003;May;REPORT;Positive;0.8157117962837219;it also appears that the strong expansion of m3 should not adversely affect this outlook as portfolio shifts have played a prominent role in particular the build up of liquidity should not translate into inflationary pressure as long as economic growth remains modest
2003-05-08;2003;May;REPORT;Negative;0.5240645408630371;hence crosschecking the information from the two pillars leads us to conclude that the risks to price stability over the medium term remain limited
2003-05-08;2003;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.973965585231781;regarding fiscal policy developments in 2002 were generally not satisfactory
2003-05-08;2003;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9932871460914612;in particular countries that had not achieved sound fiscal positions in earlier years when the economic conditions were more favourable are now struggling to keep their budgets under control
2003-05-08;2003;May;REPORT;Positive;0.963487982749939;looking ahead it is crucial to underpin the fiscal policy framework with decisive action strong peer pressure and consistent implementation of the rules of the treaty and of the stability and growth pact
2003-05-08;2003;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9356490969657898;countries should maintain budgetary positions close to balance or in surplus over the cycle and where this is not yet the case take the required structural consolidation measures
2003-05-08;2003;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.919958233833313;this also creates the necessary room for the operation of automatic stabilisers
2003-05-08;2003;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.5253239870071411;at the same time governments are advised to place the emphasis on growthoriented consolidation policies that strengthen the productive forces of the economy
2003-05-08;2003;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9886986613273621;by strengthening confidence a credible mediumterm fiscal consolidation strategy will also support economic growth in the short term
2003-05-08;2003;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9746570587158203;finally structural reforms are essential to increase the euro areas growth potential and enhance its ability to better withstand external shocks
2003-05-08;2003;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9878424406051636;indeed such reforms which should aim to reduce rigidities in labour and goods markets could significantly strengthen the degree of resilience of economic activity to such shocks both in the euro area as a whole and in its regions
2003-05-08;2003;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9897822141647339;renewed momentum in the process of structural reform will be important to foster consumer and investor confidence in medium and longterm growth and employment opportunities in the euro area
2003-05-08;2003;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9862627983093262;this in turn should also have a positive shortterm effect on spending and investment decisions in the euro area
