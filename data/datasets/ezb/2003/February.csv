2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9431644082069397;introductory statement willem f duisenberg president of the european central bank lucas papademos vicepresident of the european central bank frankfurt 6 february 2003 with a transcript of the questions and answers ladies and gentlemen the vicepresident and i will report on the outcome of todays meeting of the governing council of the ecb
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.979530930519104;we have reviewed monetary financial and economic developments and have incorporated new information into our assessment
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9123093485832214;overall the current monetary policy stance remains appropriate to preserve a favourable outlook for price stability in the medium term
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9730509519577026;consequently we have kept our key interest rates unchanged
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Positive;0.8381004929542542;their low level should help counterbalance the negative effects on economic activity that currently stem from the high degree of worldwide uncertainty and should thereby contribute to a sustainable economic recovery in the course of 2003 for the time being we still assume that the high degree of uncertainty will decline in the course of this year
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9360458254814148;however at this juncture it is very difficult if not impossible to form a conclusive judgement on the impact of geopolitical developments on the world economy in general and the euro area in particular
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9871189594268799;turning to the analysis under the first pillar of our monetary policy strategy the threemonth average of the annual growth rates of m3 declined to 69 in the period from october to december 2002 from 71 in the period from september to november 2002 the continued strong monetary growth reflects an ongoing pronounced preference for liquidity in an environment of high financial economic and geopolitical uncertainty
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9137476086616516;however it also mirrors the low level of shortterm and longterm interest rates in the euro area
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9913882613182068;although liquidity remains ample it is unlikely at this stage that it will give rise to inflationary pressures given the current economic environment and the expectation that some of the portfolio shifts will be reversed once the financial market uncertainty diminishes
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8169212341308594;this assessment is also supported by the continuing moderate growth of loans to the private sector
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Negative;0.99103844165802;as regards the information under the second pillar economic activity in the euro area remained subdued around the turn of the year as suggested by recently published data and survey information
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Positive;0.8828888535499573;these indications are broadly in line with previous expectations which suggest a gradual increase starting in the second half of the year in real gdp growth rates to levels close to potential
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9921780228614807;whereas the appreciation of the euro over recent months may contribute to dampening export growth to some extent the price competitiveness of euro area companies remains favourable in a mediumterm perspective and export growth should benefit from the expected recovery of the world economy
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9836925268173218;therefore recent exchange rate movements should not fundamentally affect the main scenario for the economic outlook
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9681268334388733;at the same time several factors contributing to the general climate of uncertainty are still in place
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9862733483314514;in particular investors remain risk averse against the background of ongoing geopolitical tension
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9871721863746643;further turbulence in the oil markets could have a negative impact on economic activity throughout the world and thereby also on euro area employment
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9931851029396057;these concerns are also weighing on consumer confidence
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9931564927101135;finally the accumulated macroeconomic imbalances give rise to uncertainty about the strength of the recovery in other major economies
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9933383464813232;taken together there remain downside risks to the outlook for euro area economic activity
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9528113007545471;considering price developments according to eurostats flash estimate annual hicp inflation decreased to 21 in january 2003 from 23 in the previous month
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9377325773239136;as usual these estimates are subject to uncertainty and there is no precise breakdown available as yet
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9904994368553162;however it appears that compensating factors played a role on the one hand there was upward pressure from the recent hike in oil prices and from various increases in indirect taxes and administered prices at the beginning of 2003 on the other hand the strengthening of the euro and benign base effects are dampening consumer price increases
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9144218564033508;these two latter factors should also help to further reduce annual rates of hicp inflation over the next few months
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9772447943687439;however given the high volatility in oil markets shortterm forecasts for hicp inflation are currently subject to a particularly high degree of uncertainty
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9822633862495422;beyond the immediate future the gradual passthrough of the appreciation of the euro together with the expected moderate improvement in economic growth should reduce inflationary pressures
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Negative;0.8761491179466248;the most likely outcome remains that inflation will fall and eventually stabilise at a level below 2 in the course of 2003 a major condition for price stability to also prevail in the medium term will be moderate wage developments
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9897985458374023;wage moderation would also help improve the prospects for economic growth and further employment creation
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9653893709182739;it is therefore of particular importance that the upward trend in wage growth finally comes to a halt
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9887925982475281;however the indications for this are still mixed despite weak economic activity throughout last year
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Negative;0.8741979002952576;as for fiscal policy the framework laid down in the treaty and the stability and growth pact limits the risk of fiscal imbalances occurring and therefore contributes significantly to favourable financing conditions for the private sector
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Positive;0.4908379316329956;at the same time it allows an appropriate mediumterm orientation of fiscal policy which fosters confidence and thereby growth
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8867666125297546;in order to fully reap the benefits of this framework it is important that countries respect its objectives and implement appropriate consolidation plans where needed
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9823692440986633;hence the commitments made in the stability programmes and the requests to further improve fiscal positions as subsequently agreed in the ecofin council must be met in full
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Negative;0.7613945603370667;these benefits would be magnified if the underlying policy measures were part of a comprehensive reform strategy to support economic growth
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9641232490539551;it is in fact the implementation of structural reforms at the micro level that ultimately raises the production potential improves flexibility in the economy and makes the euro area more resilient to external shocks
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9937147498130798;clearly lack of progress in structural reform is one of the key factors currently hampering a recovery in confidence
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9866935610771179;therefore the governing council welcomes a recent communication by the commission on the implementation of the broad economic policy guidelines
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Positive;0.5427821278572083;it emphasises the need to step up the pace of labour market reform to achieve the lisbon objectives to fully implement the internal market and to enhance competition in product markets as well as to foster capital market integration entrepreneurship a knowledgebased economy and research and development
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9762444496154785;we fully share the commissions assessment that policy inertia and backtracking are widespread
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9711297154426575;against this background renewed momentum in the process of structural reform will be crucial to foster confidence among consumers and investors
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9202549457550049;transcript of the questions asked and the answers given by dr willem f duisenberg president of the ecb dr lucas papademos vicepresident of the ecb question given the fact that the inflation rate looks benign and that there are still downside risks to growth which impediments do you have to cutting rates
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Negative;0.8998886346817017;duisenberg the impediments to cutting rates at this moment are the big uncertainties that still surround the figures that you mentioned
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9810228943824768;the uncertainties relating to oil prices the geopolitical uncertainties and well let me say this we were afraid that if one were to cut at this moment it would be a drop that would drown in the sea of uncertainties
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9096742868423462;question mr duisenberg could you comment on whether you think this is the time for eu leaders to select an alternate candidate to succeed you given that mr trichet has not yet been cleared on the trial
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9635905623435974;and secondly would you also comment on a study that the ecb staff is conducting on the erm what are the purposes of this study and when will it be completed
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8688425421714783;duisenberg on the first i will not comment
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9701874256134033;all i can say is that i have written my usual letter to mr solana requesting him to set in motion the process of appointing or nominating a successor to both ms hämäläinen and me
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9484736323356628;that is all i can say about this at this moment
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9049035310745239;a special study on erm is not on the cards at this moment
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8612931966781616;we know enough about erm ii
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9801218509674072;what we do know is that at the ecofin in the course of the coming months ministers intend to pay some attention to the functioning of erm ii in relation to the accession of ten new members to the european union
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9922851324081421;and upon accession these new members will by treaty agree that the exchange rate is a matter of common interest as treaty language says
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.981438398361206;therefore we are contemplating this issue as well rather than studying it
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.7595440745353699;we have had enough studies i believe
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8883043527603149;question just a followup on that answer to the first question would you actually go so far as to say that the threat of war in iraq effectively puts a brake on any policy action by the ecb until that whole situation is resolved
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.7612850069999695;and secondly the greek central bank governor the other day said that foreign exchange market intervention in general is futile and i was wondering if you would agree with that comment
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8786423206329346;duisenberg well as i have learned  as have you i believe  on foreign exchange interventions i will keep my mouth shut so i will say nothing about it
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9733417630195618;on the first the geopolitical situation is one of the factors of grave and great uncertainty in the world
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8147303462028503;i would not go as far as your suggestion might imply that that uncertainty would have to be out of the way before we could do anything
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.890396237373352;we can do anything we want whenever we want
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.704344630241394;question mr duisenberg could you elaborate a little bit more on forex markets and the euro
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9475126266479492;is the strong euro an issue of concern and is the speed of the appreciation of concern for you
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Negative;0.7787396907806396;duisenberg well it is a not a matter of concern
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.688982367515564;first of all the euro has for some weeks now been fluctuating around a level against the dollar of around 108 which is still slightly below the average level of the euro in the two years preceding the introduction of the euro
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9633965492248535;so it still reflects we think a healthy competitive position which has not been undermined by the recent nominal appreciation
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Negative;0.8669784665107727;question mr president you mentioned that it is difficult to predict the effects of what you refer to as geopolitical developments on the economy
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8718341588973999;but i am wondering if you have attempted to assess the economic impact on the euro zone of a war in iraq and if you have how you have attempted to do that and what conclusions you have drawn
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9246695637702942;and secondly i would like to ask you to what extent the failure of european leaders to find a common position on iraq is contributing to the sea of uncertainty that you mentioned
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8610963821411133;duisenberg on the latter highly political question we have not considered that
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.951699435710907;i am reporting here on the outcome of the governing councils considerations so i cannot comment on that either
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.967158317565918;on the first part we have internally in the ecb viewed various scenarios where you have to make assumptions if there is a war how long will it last
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.7389547228813171;what will the repercussions be
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9659796953201294;but that was not even ripe enough may i say to present to the governing council let alone to you
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Negative;0.6599757075309753;question is it not a little bit late
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.7265406847000122;are things not at a state of some urgency where perhaps you ought to have got it ready by now
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9327074885368347;duisenberg no because you have to consider various alternatives if there is to be a war
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9769480228424072;you have to consider the alternative that there will be no war
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8093637228012085;the alternative that it will be a very short war
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.5765740275382996;the alternative that it will be a prolonged war
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9575067162513733;all these hypothetical things we all of course keep thinking about them
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9626509547233582;but to take this into consideration when today making decisions on interest rates would be to go too far
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.6911647915840149;question just touching on the euro again
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.7390760779380798;because both mr welteke and mr solbes recently have expressed concern not so much with the exchange rate of the euro but the speed of its appreciation
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9440746307373047;in other words that it has gone too far too fast
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Negative;0.970465898513794;do you share this concern that such volatility is ultimately not a good thing for the economy
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Negative;0.8495984673500061;and just another question do you feel that the downside risks to growth have increased compared to four weeks ago
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9819615483283997;duisenberg volatility is always bad
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.6716535687446594;and we prefer stability to volatility
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.7796557545661926;but i would emphasise that the behaviour of the exchange rate over recent months has not been all that volatile
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Negative;0.5152153968811035;effectively the movements were quite limited
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9807164072990417;the largest movement we have seen was from the beginning of mr powells speech and towards the end of mr powells speech yesterday
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9846009612083435;towards the end of the speech the euro was back to where it was at the beginning of the speech
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9417853951454163;but that is the largest amount of volatility we have seen in many weeks and therefore neither the speed and certainly not the degree of socalled volatility  which was not much  is a cause of concern for us
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.5490108728408813;turning to the downside risks we already took these into account in our decision to lower interest rates by 50 basis points in december
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.7718410491943359;we publicly said that this step in december was somewhat larger than one could have otherwise anticipated because of the downside risks we saw emerging then
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Negative;0.8074755668640137;those downside risks have certainly not disappeared since then
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9563321471214294;i am inclined to say they have been exacerbated over recent months
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.5749304890632629;so they are still there but they were not unexpected
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8245316743850708;question mr president could you elaborate a little bit on your projections you made in december
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8610236048698425;how has your view changed since that time
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9274170994758606;when does the growth rate recover to the potential growth rate
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.6470873355865479;will we have to wait until next year instead of the second half of this year
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9620533585548401;duisenberg our socalled baseline scenario which we presented in december is still unchanged
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9873736500740051;the risks to the downside have increased
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9801850318908691;we will have new forecasts internally in the course of this spring
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Negative;0.6223904490470886;and i will not be surprised if they have to be slightly revised downwards
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8572495579719543;but we are not certain yet
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9769573211669922;for the time being we stick to our main scenario which is that we will have a moderate resumption of growth especially in the course of the second half of this year and that we will be at or close to the potential rate of growth towards the end of this year
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9029440879821777;question could one say that there is a loosening bias now in the monetary policy
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.944538414478302;duisenberg i do not like the expression bias in the monetary policy
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Negative;0.5981429815292358;but you can read from my introductory statement that whereas on the one hand i repeated what i said last month that the monetary policy stance is appropriate i also added the words that for the time being we still assume that the high degree of uncertainty will decline in the course of this year
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9762969613075256;from that you can infer some increased uncertainty also on our side
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.829769492149353;question mr president the markets are calling the euro a safe haven these days
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8255455493927002;would you say that the perception of the euro on the markets has changed fundamentally when you look at these comments and that the euro might now be able to take over some of the safe haven prominence from the dollar or is this more of a shortterm thing going on
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8355743288993835;duisenberg to say that things have fundamentally changed we need more fundamental evidence and we need more time to assess
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9281322956085205;what is a curious thing let me put it that way is that  when in the past there was geopolitical uncertainty as we now euphemistically call it  the dollar was the safe haven for the world
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.910222053527832;now it weighs on the dollar rather than boosts it
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9219048619270325;and that is the difference from past experience
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9803913831710815;it would go beyond a responsible answer if i already drew conclusions from that in the direction of safe haven functions
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8812090754508972;but what we do see is that there is an increased i am also inclined to use the word appreciation an increased value judgement on the part of many investors in the world including central banks to regard the euro as an attractive alternative to invest your funds in as compared with other currencies
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9613966941833496;question do you think that an additional appreciation of the euro could represent on the one hand a problem or a danger for economic growth and on the other hand could not create additional and substantial benefits to the further dampening of inflation
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.908104419708252;duisenberg well i do not like to answer speculative or hypothetical questions
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Negative;0.8917794227600098;so far it is not a danger
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.87551349401474;it is having  over time  a helpful effect to keep inflation down or to contain inflationary pressures
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Positive;0.585002601146698;and so far it has not undermined the competitive position of europe and the direction of course in which the exchange rates are moving are a help in correcting the major imbalances that exist worldwide
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Negative;0.6006331443786621;question president duisenberg would you say that the dampening effect of the rise in the euro will increase or has it been unchanged in recent weeks or has it decreased a little bit
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Negative;0.6586028933525085;my second question is at the last press conference you said that you did not expect a contraction in first quarter gdp
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Negative;0.6537032127380371;now that you have more economic data is that still the case
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Negative;0.5178585648536682;duisenberg last question yes that is still the case
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9655091166496277;and we have to reckon with the effect that it takes a lot longer for exchange rate movements to work their way through into domestic price developments than it takes oil price increases to work their way into domestic price rises
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8981019258499146;so the time lags between the two are significantly different and the impact of the recent appreciation in the value of the euro let us say since 1 january still has to work its way through
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.876643180847168;but it will work its way through into further domestic price developments
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8569322824478149;question translation what is your reaction to the criticism by ministers of the rotation model suggested by the governing council
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9488281011581421;secondly what is the state of the verification of the strategy
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9755502343177795;when will the result be published
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9698259830474854;maybe in june when you publish your halfyearly report
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9889650344848633;and a general question on the projections the experts will start work in march but the previous assumptions were usd 099 as the euro exchange rate an oil price of usd 26 and an interest rate of 325
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9542396068572998;what is the current state of your assessment with regard to the old projections and the value of publishing such outdated projections
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.7478471994400024;duisenberg to the critics of the rotation model that we unanimously agreed on in the governing council and that we have presented to the european council in the composition of heads of state and government well i am almost inclined to say i still have to meet someone including myself who is unconditionally happy with the outcome
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8905598521232605;but as you know we had to meet quite a number of criteria to make the new system robust transparent and simple and it is not simple after all
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8790900707244873;you cannot fulfil all these conditions simultaneously
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.7985752820968628;but we did preserve a few very important principles
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9882681965827942;first the rotation model only relates to the frequency with which member states or individuals in the governing council take part in the vote if there is a vote
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9792627096176147;second for the vote itself we maintained the principle of one man one vote
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Negative;0.7075168490409851;that for us was of extreme importance
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8980578184127808;now i am also very happy to say that if i listen to the criticisms i hear them coming equally from large and small countries
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.5181052088737488;had it been onesided then i would have been concerned but now that it comes from all sides i think that that helps me
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9768009185791016;and i challenge anyone  and that includes all ministers  to come up with a model that is as transparent as equitable and as simple as the one we have come up with
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.506923258304596;and therefore my indications are that in the end our proposal is very likely to prevail
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9878848195075989;we have started with our staff  by which i mean the staff of the ecb and all ncbs  to undertake an evaluation of our monetary policy strategy
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9625095725059509;as i have indicated it is about time after five years of experience with the current strategy
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9536222815513611;and i can in no way indicate what the outcome of that evaluation is ultimately going to be
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9878054857254028;as far as the timetable is concerned i read somewhere that it will be decided whilst i was still president and it would be published on the first day of the new presidents term of office
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.917531430721283;that was news to me there is no such timetable
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9805874824523926;we think in the governing council that we will complete this evaluation in the course of the spring and as soon as we have completed it we will publish it
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9063674807548523;as for the projections i cannot say at the moment the issue is in full swing at staff level and of course the underlying assumptions have to be changed
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9859150648117065;the exchange rate has changed and interest rates have changed since the last projections were made
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9561133980751038;of course these factors will be taken into account but precisely how and how much it is impossible for me to answer that at this point
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9489436745643616;question i would like to ask you if you have been in contact with the bank of england today and why you came to other conclusions than the bank of england today
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Negative;0.6618369817733765;is one of the reasons that the british government is much nearer in the iraq conflict to the united states than the rest of europe is
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8458855152130127;duisenberg well maybe you have already given the answer yourself
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9515953660011292;if the question is have you been in contact the answer is yes
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9097856879234314;and not only today
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8819394111633301;and why did they come to different conclusions
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8205763697624207;they are a different economy
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8715824484825134;and i explained why we came to the conclusions as we did
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9370375871658325;i am not going to comment on the conclusions that another major central bank reached in quite a different situation
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9893291592597961;but if i may make one comment i would like to emphasise that our main interest rates are currently at 2ï½
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.7778699398040771;they brought theirs down today from 4 to 3ï½
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8354335427284241;and that is something of a difference as well
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Negative;0.49439337849617004;question mr president you mention various factors of uncertainty but do you regret the current additional uncertainty on your policy regarding your successor and the fate of mr trichet in france
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8927788138389587;and what do you wish in this context
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9023621678352356;duisenberg i wish as little uncertainty as possible
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9440760016441345;but then of course i regret that this process in general terms is dragging on for such a long time
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Negative;0.8130712509155273;that is never good
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9387937188148499;not for the person not for the institutions that he represents not for the issues that he and i are concerned with or are busy working on
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9167147278785706;for that reason i would hope that this long drawnout process will be over sooner rather than later
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9326806664466858;question this is a question for whichever of you prefers to answer
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8075478076934814;based on what i have heard today it sounds like you discussed the arguments for and against cutting rates at this meeting
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8584786057472229;is this a true statement
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9354559779167175;duisenberg that is a true statement
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.7537205815315247;question how strong was the consensus for leaving the rates unchanged
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9458299279212952;duisenberg very strong
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8839651942253113;question mr duisenberg let me ask you about a suggestion from the far east
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9722520112991333;the japanese ministry of finance is suggesting having some sort of collaboration in the market on a reflation policy
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9559487700462341;i would like to have your judgement and do you think you will have any chance to talk about such an idea at the next g7 meeting in paris
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9387359023094177;duisenberg yes i will have a chance to discuss those matters
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9817201495170593;not only at the next g7 meeting but already next sunday when all the asian governors meet with some governors from other continents in sydney in australia
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9390238523483276;question and your judgement of such an idea
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9495453238487244;duisenberg well as you know our mandate our aim is to keep inflation below 2 but above 0
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9225043654441833;now in the japanese case you are very close to 0
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Negative;0.5153957605361938;therefore i can imagine that both the fiscal and the monetary authorities are thinking about means to get a little bit further away from that zero inflation environment which is close to deflation
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8555960059165955;question i know that you both were very engaged in finding a good proposal for the ecb for the reform of the voting rights
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9653725624084473;and you have been doing a good job making a european monetary policy
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.643665075302124;so it is very difficult to understand for someone like me that even after four years the council approves of a model that has a lot of national elements
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9234738349914551;so why was it not possible to really find a european approach
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9733972549438477;there are good approaches where the decisions would depend on persons on qualified persons and not on small and big nations
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.5693336725234985;why did you fail
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Negative;0.7336570024490356;for me it was a failure
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9822928309440613;and it was a disappointing failure really
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9287168383598328;duisenberg because if you consider more radical approaches that basically would mean that the decisionmaking body or the voting body would be even smaller than it is today
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9839522242546082;today it consists of 18 governors  the governing council that is  all representing not their countries but being there in a personal capacity
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9895210266113281;if as the treaty foresees all european union members were members of the euro area that would take it to 21 to go to a smaller number would mean excluding some participants from taking part in the vote
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.936958909034729;some countries also
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9475315809249878;now you could do that
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9503659009933472;but you do not become a member of a union with the prospect of having nothing to say about it
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9770824909210205;now our proposal does not exclude anybody from taking part in the discussions
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9766472578048706;everybody is entitled to take part in the discussions on monetary policy and all the other kinds of issues which we have to deal with
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9646132588386536;i admit that on the voting there is something that relates to the size of the countries participating
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8952638506889343;and if you now expand the governing council by at least ten members and in the nice treaty it is counted on that there might be 12 extra members which would then be 27 plus six of the executive board which makes 33 in that case there was a legitimate fear on behalf of especially the larger countries that they could easily  also on monetary policy  be outvoted by a majority representing  in aggregate terms  less than 34 of the enlarged euro area gdp
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9811415076255798;that was a legitimate fear
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9819597005844116;the solution applies only to the voting frequency and not to the discussion participation which is free for all
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8513079285621643;so the influence is there
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9465086460113525;and the voting itself remains one man one vote without regard to nationality
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.6085427403450012;papademos i think you explained this very well
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9083259105682373;perhaps i should add two points
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9338081479072571;as you mentioned earlier the relative complexity of the model reflects the fact that it aimed to be compatible with a number of criteria
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9752011299133301;and it primarily reflects the new structure the representativeness principle
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9801745414733887;and another point which you also touched upon is that it is often not realised that the voting in the governing council relates not only to issues of monetary policy but also to various other issues for which representation of the national central banks within a framework similar to the present one is warranted
2003-02-06;2003;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8578716516494751;duisenberg for example payment systems
