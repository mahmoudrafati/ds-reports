2003-10-02;2003;October;REPORT;Positive;0.5930539965629578;however the latest data and information are consistent with a moderate pickup in activity in the second half
2003-10-02;2003;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9888066053390503;in particular there are signs that economic activity might have firmed somewhat in the third quarter and confidence indicators available up to september generally point to some improvement in economic expectations

2003-10-02;2003;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.7708377838134766;domestically companies seem to be continuing their adjustment efforts to enhance productivity and profitability
2003-10-02;2003;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9833769798278809;this together with the low level of interest rates should contribute to a recovery in investment

2003-10-02;2003;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9377473592758179;the shortterm risks to our main scenario of a gradual recovery appear to be broadly balanced
2003-10-02;2003;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9890507459640503;however some risks to the sustainability of economic growth at the global level remain
2003-10-02;2003;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9771501421928406;these are related to the mediumterm sustainability of public finances in major industrialised countries and in this connection the adjustment of external imbalances in some regions of the world
2003-10-02;2003;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9800463914871216;turning to the outlook for prices according to eurostats latest flash estimate hicp inflation in september was 21

2003-10-02;2003;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9749098420143127;for the remainder of this year hicp inflation should hover at around 2
2003-10-02;2003;October;REPORT;Positive;0.845371663570404;exchange rate developments help to contain shortterm upward pressure on prices while higher unprocessed food prices related to the hot and dry weather conditions in some euro area countries could imply some limited upward risk over the next few months
2003-10-02;2003;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9058371186256409;for early 2004 there is still some uncertainty about the precise impact on hicp inflation of planned increases in indirect taxes and administered prices in a number of euro area countries
2003-10-02;2003;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.6569323539733887;looking beyond the short term however we continue to expect inflation to fall below 2 in 2004 and to remain in line with price stability thereafter
2003-10-02;2003;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.6615940928459167;this expectation is based on the assumption of moderate wage developments in the context of a gradual economic recovery
2003-10-02;2003;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9858617782592773;in this respect we note that inflation expectations in the euro area are anchored at levels below but close to 2 over the medium to long term
2003-10-02;2003;October;REPORT;Positive;0.990562915802002;turning to the monetary analysis the strong monetary growth over the past two years has been fuelled by past portfolio shifts precautionary saving and the low level of interest rates
2003-10-02;2003;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9929453730583191;the latter factor also provided a counterweight to the negative impact of weak economic growth on loan developments
2003-10-02;2003;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9788377285003662;in fact there are signs of a pickup in the growth rates of loans to the private sector
2003-10-02;2003;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9943740367889404;at the current juncture the accumulation of excess liquidity is not a cause for concern given the subdued economic growth in the euro area
2003-10-02;2003;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9723305702209473;however if it were to persist in conjunction with a significant strengthening of economic activity it could lead to inflationary pressures in the medium term

2003-10-02;2003;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9868049621582031;there is growing evidence that most countries will miss their budgetary targets for 2003 by a significant margin and in a number of cases budgetary plans for 2004 are not reassuring
2003-10-02;2003;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9931038022041321;while the deterioration of budgetary balances mainly reflects the lowerthananticipated economic growth it is worrying to see that not all countries with severe imbalances have so far introduced sufficient consolidation measures
2003-10-02;2003;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.7799116969108582;it is fundamental that the credibility of the institutional underpinnings of emu be maintained
2003-10-02;2003;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8589757680892944;in this respect let me stress that the treaty and the stability and growth pact provide an appropriate framework for maintaining fiscal discipline within adequate bounds of flexibility
2003-10-02;2003;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9555935263633728;far from being a mechanical scheme to constrain fiscal policies the excessive deficit procedure establishes a sequence of incentives for countries to prevent and correct severe budgetary imbalances
2003-10-02;2003;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.989575982093811;at each instance of this sequence a countrys fiscal efforts and changes in the economic environment are assessed and taken into account in the design of further steps
2003-10-02;2003;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9810478091239929;countries are therefore continuously made aware of the risks and costs arising from any delay in taking policy action to preserve the sustainability of public finances
2003-10-02;2003;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9834136366844177;to maintain the credibility of the fiscal policy framework it is essential to fully abide by its rules and to implement them in every respect
2003-10-02;2003;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9879887104034424;doing so and complying with the requirements of the ecofin council will lead to positive confidence and growth effects which can be strengthened if fiscal plans are part of a comprehensive and credible mediumterm strategy with emphasis on structural expenditure reform
2003-10-02;2003;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8926730155944824;finally although it might mean stating the obvious here in lisbon the lisbon strategy which was agreed upon back in march 2000 is of the utmost importance in the process of implementing structural reforms
2003-10-02;2003;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9923298954963684;more reforms are urgently needed to reduce structural rigidities in labour and goods markets so as to address the main economic problem of the euro area namely the high level of structural unemployment
2003-10-02;2003;October;REPORT;Positive;0.6665019392967224;at the same time current efforts to set in motion important changes in pension and health systems and in other areas in order to prepare for the ageing of society are of immense significance in ensuring the sustainability of our social security systems
2003-10-02;2003;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9096652269363403;let me close with a few personal remarks
2003-10-02;2003;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9778703451156616;as you are aware this will most probably be the last press conference following a meeting of the governing council that i will chair
2003-10-02;2003;October;REPORT;Positive;0.5057457685470581;from my perspective these press conferences have been a success
2003-10-02;2003;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9888105392456055;their purpose is to inform the media and the general public in detail and on an almost realtime basis about the outcome of governing council meetings
2003-10-02;2003;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9832941293716431;they have allowed us to communicate and clarify our policy decisions in an open and transparent manner
2003-10-02;2003;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.82936030626297;indeed in my view this practice makes the ecb one of the most transparent central banks in the world
2003-10-02;2003;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8756716847419739;i would like to take this opportunity to thank the media for their work over the fiveandahalf years in which i have had the privilege of being at the helm of the governing council
