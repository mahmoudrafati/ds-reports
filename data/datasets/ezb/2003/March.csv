2003-03-06;2003;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.945992648601532;let me explain our assessment of recent economic developments in more detail
2003-03-06;2003;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9887673258781433;as regards the analysis under the first pillar of our monetary policy strategy the threemonth average of the annual growth rates of m3 was 71 in the period from november 2002 to january 2003 compared with 69 in the period from october to december 2002 the continued strong monetary growth reflects an ongoing pronounced preference for liquidity in an environment of high financial economic and geopolitical uncertainty
2003-03-06;2003;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9851561784744263;although liquidity remains ample it is not expected at this stage to give rise to inflationary pressures given the current economic context and the expectation that some of the portfolio shifts will be reversed once the financial market uncertainty diminishes

2003-03-06;2003;March;REPORT;Negative;0.7332437634468079;accordingly only a very modest rate of economic growth should now be expected this year

2003-03-06;2003;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.5819719433784485;the main factor behind this change seems to be the rise in oil prices
2003-03-06;2003;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9846116900444031;in addition some base effects related to food prices may have contributed to the renewed increase in annual inflation in february
2003-03-06;2003;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9788034558296204;the ongoing volatility in oil markets makes it difficult to forecast shortterm inflation developments
2003-03-06;2003;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.4971472918987274;however once some normalisation in these markets has occurred more fundamental factors should dominate price developments
2003-03-06;2003;March;REPORT;Positive;0.7722261548042297;first the significant appreciation of the nominal effective exchange rate of the euro over the past year is expected to continue to feed through the economy into consumer prices via import and producer prices
2003-03-06;2003;March;REPORT;Positive;0.4485310912132263;second the moderate pace of economic growth should also reduce inflationary pressures influencing price and costsetting behaviours
2003-03-06;2003;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8973455429077148;if oil prices moderate in the future as currently expected by markets the most likely outcome will be that inflation rates will fall below 2 in the course of 2003 and remain clearly at levels in line with price stability thereafter
2003-03-06;2003;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.6033298969268799;this baseline scenario relies on the assumption that especially in an environment of subdued economic growth wage moderation will prevail
2003-03-06;2003;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9448477625846863;in fact some recent indications suggest more modest wage developments towards the end of last year but this picture would need to be confirmed in the future

2003-03-06;2003;March;REPORT;Negative;0.5174756646156311;looking ahead the most likely scenario is that economic growth will gradually recover once the factors contributing to the high economic uncertainty have diminished
2003-03-06;2003;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9818294048309326;while the expected weak economic activity at the beginning of this year will imply low average economic growth in 2003 a rise in quarterly growth rates should materialise in the course of the year
2003-03-06;2003;March;REPORT;Positive;0.992460310459137;over time the euro area economy should benefit from a global economic recovery and the prevailing low levels of interest rates as well as from falling inflation supporting real disposable income and underpinning private consumption growth
2003-03-06;2003;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9407107830047607;however any judgement on future developments is overshadowed at present by the geopolitical tensions and their potential resolution

2003-03-06;2003;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9950389266014099;in some cases current consolidation ambitions are weak
2003-03-06;2003;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9596595764160156;in order to further boost confidence in the fiscal framework and the economic environment it is essential that appropriate consolidation plans are implemented in all countries with remaining imbalances
2003-03-06;2003;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9853349924087524;hence the commitments made in the stability programmes and the requests to further improve fiscal positions as subsequently agreed in the ecofin council must be implemented in full
2003-03-06;2003;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9729299545288086;in this respect the measures should be part of a comprehensive and growthoriented strategy which for most countries means putting the focus on both restraining the volume and reforming the structure of public expenditure
