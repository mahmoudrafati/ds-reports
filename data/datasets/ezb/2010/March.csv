2010-03-04;2010;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.935492992401123;let me now explain our assessment in greater detail starting with the economic analysis
2010-03-04;2010;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9924393892288208;over recent quarters the euro area has continued to benefit from the significant macroeconomic stimulus provided and the measures adopted to restore the functioning of the banking system as well as from the ongoing recovery in the world economy
2010-03-04;2010;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.5511379837989807;according to eurostats first release in quarteronquarter terms euro area real gdp increased by 01 in the fourth quarter of 2009 after growing by 04 in the third quarter
2010-03-04;2010;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9760644435882568;available indicators suggest that the economic recovery in the euro area is on track although it is likely to remain uneven
2010-03-04;2010;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9638258218765259;in particular a number of special factors are at play including adverse weather conditions in parts of the euro area in the first quarter of 2010 given this uneven pattern it is more appropriate to look through the quarterly volatility and to compare growth developments on a halfyearly basis
2010-03-04;2010;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9911736845970154;looking ahead the governing council expects real gdp growth to remain moderate in 2010 owing to the ongoing process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors and the expectation that the low capacity utilisation is likely to dampen investment and that consumption is being dampened by weak labour market prospects
2010-03-04;2010;March;REPORT;Negative;0.5281705856323242;this assessment is also reflected in the march 2010 ecb staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area which foresee annual real gdp growth in a range between 04 and 12 for 2010 and between 05 and 25 for 2011 compared with the eurosystem staff projections published in december 2009 the range for real gdp growth in 2010 is slightly narrower while for 2011 the range has been revised slightly upwards reflecting notably stronger activity worldwide the governing council continues to view the risks to this outlook as broadly balanced in an environment marked by continued uncertainty

2010-03-04;2010;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9908587336540222;in this context it is important to emphasise that inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the governing councils aim of keeping inflation rates below but close to 2 over the medium term
2010-03-04;2010;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9907757639884949;this assessment is also reflected in the march 2010 ecb staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area which foresee annual hicp inflation in a range between 08 and 16 for 2010 and between 09 and 21 for 2011 compared with the eurosystem staff projections published in december 2009 the range for 2010 has been adjusted marginally downwards while the range for 2011 has been adjusted slightly upwards
2010-03-04;2010;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8692217469215393;risks to this outlook remain broadly balanced
2010-03-04;2010;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9710034132003784;they relate in particular to further developments in economic activity and the evolution of commodity prices

2010-03-04;2010;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9861008524894714;this reflects mainly a base effect and confirms the assessment of continued weak monetary growth
2010-03-04;2010;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9642263054847717;together with the negative annual rate of growth in loans to the private sector equal to 06 in january 2010 the latest data support the assessment that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is moderate and that in the medium term the inflationary pressures associated with monetary developments are low
2010-03-04;2010;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9953604340553284;the growth of m3 and loans to the private sector is likely to remain weak also in the coming months
2010-03-04;2010;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9932677745819092;at the same time actual monetary developments are likely to be weaker than the underlying pace of monetary expansion on account of the downward impact of the steep yield curve
2010-03-04;2010;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9581072330474854;this fosters the allocation of funds away from m3 and into longerterm deposits and securities
2010-03-04;2010;March;REPORT;Positive;0.989422619342804;on the other hand the narrow spreads between the interest rates paid on different m3 instruments imply a low opportunity cost of holding funds in the most liquid components included in m1 which continued to grow at a robust annual rate of 115 in january
2010-03-04;2010;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9799701571464539;the negative annual growth of loans to the private sector conceals ongoing opposite developments positive strengthening annual growth in loans to households on the one hand and negative declining annual growth in loans to nonfinancial corporations on the other hand
2010-03-04;2010;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9938404560089111;such differences are consistent with historical patterns and cyclical regularities which suggest that loans to nonfinancial corporations can be expected to remain weak for some time after economic activity has picked up

2010-03-04;2010;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9736190438270569;to address this challenge banks should use the improved funding conditions to strengthen their capital bases further and where necessary take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation
2010-03-04;2010;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9898592829704285;to sum up the current key ecb interest rates remain appropriate
