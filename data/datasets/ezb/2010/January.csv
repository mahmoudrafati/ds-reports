2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9578161835670471;we will now report on the outcome of todays meeting of the governing council which was also attended by commissioner almunia
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9930746555328369;based on its regular economic and monetary analyses the governing council decided to leave the key ecb interest rates unchanged
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9819861650466919;the current rates remain appropriate
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.972806990146637;taking into account all the information and analyses that have become available since our meeting on 3 december 2009 price developments are expected to remain subdued over the policyrelevant horizon
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9870131611824036;the latest information has also confirmed that towards the end of 2009 euro area economic activity continued to expand
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Negative;0.700739860534668;however some of the factors supporting the growth in real gdp are of a temporary nature
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9902645349502563;overall the governing council expects the euro area economy to grow at a moderate pace in 2010 recognising that the recovery process is likely to be uneven and that the outlook remains subject to uncertainty
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Negative;0.4774695932865143;the outcome of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressure over the medium term given the ongoing parallel decline in money and credit growth
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9268136620521545;all in all we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.989439070224762;medium to longerterm inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with the governing councils aim of keeping inflation rates below but close to 2 over the medium term
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.935492992401123;let me now explain our assessment in greater detail starting with the economic analysis
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9893901944160461;following the 04 quarteronquarter increase in real gdp in the third quarter of 2009 the latest information confirms that towards the end of last year economic activity in the euro area continued to expand
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9920742511749268;the euro area has been benefiting from a turn in the inventory cycle and a recovery in exports as well as from the significant macroeconomic stimulus under way and the measures adopted to restore the functioning of the financial system
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9535765051841736;however a number of the supporting factors are of a temporary nature
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9664403200149536;furthermore there is likely to be a drag on activity for some time to come on account of the ongoing process of balance sheet adjustment in the financial and nonfinancial sectors both inside and outside the euro area
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9862100481987;in addition low capacity utilisation rates are likely to dampen investment and unemployment in the euro area is expected to increase somewhat further thereby lowering consumption growth
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9768983721733093;for these reasons the euro area economy is expected to grow only at a moderate pace in 2010 and the recovery process could be uneven
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9660271406173706;the governing council continues to view the risks to this outlook as broadly balanced
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9916632175445557;on the upside there may be stronger than anticipated effects stemming from the extensive macroeconomic stimulus being provided and from other policy measures taken
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Positive;0.992030143737793;confidence may also improve further and the global economy as well as foreign trade may recover more strongly than projected
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9786592125892639;on the downside concerns remain relating to a stronger or more protracted than expected negative feedback loop between the real economy and the financial sector renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices the intensification of protectionist pressures and the possibility of disruptive market movements related to the correction of global imbalances
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9841521978378296;with regard to price developments as expected euro area annual hicp inflation increased further in december 2009 to stand at 09 after 05 in november
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.8783345818519592;the rise mainly reflects upward base effects stemming mostly from the drop in global energy prices a year ago
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9833714365959167;inflation is expected to remain around 1 in the near term
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Negative;0.992486834526062;looking further ahead inflation is expected to remain moderate over the policyrelevant horizon with overall price cost and wage developments staying subdued in line with a slow recovery in demand in the euro area and elsewhere
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.988610029220581;in this context it is important to emphasise once again that inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the governing councils aim of keeping inflation rates below but close to 2 over the medium term
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.8692217469215393;risks to this outlook remain broadly balanced
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9600492715835571;they relate in particular to the outlook for economic activity and the evolution of commodity prices
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Positive;0.987246036529541;furthermore increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be stronger than currently expected owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.663263738155365;turning to the monetary analysis both the annual growth rates of m3 and loans to the private sector were negative in november standing at 02 and 07 respectively
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9874651432037354;the concurrent declines to historically low growth rates recorded in these two series over the past months support the assessment of a decelerating underlying pace of monetary expansion and low inflationary pressures over the medium term
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9950889945030212;looking ahead m3 and credit growth are likely to remain very weak or negative for some time to come
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9894247055053711;the decline in actual monetary growth is likely to overstate the deceleration in the underlying pace of monetary expansion
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.5246286988258362;this is due to the continued steep slope of the yield curve which explains shifts of funds out of m3 into longerterm deposits and securities
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.8394761085510254;at the same time the interest rate constellation continues to foster divergent developments in the main components of m3 as the narrow spreads between the rates on different shortterm bank deposits reduce the opportunity costs of shifting funds from for instance shortterm time deposits into overnight deposits
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9845804572105408;as a result m1 continued to grow at a robust annual rate of 126 in november when annual m3 growth turned negative
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9682145714759827;the negative annual growth of bank loans to the private sector conceals a return to positive annual rates of growth in the case of loans to households while the annual growth of loans to nonfinancial corporations became more negative
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Negative;0.7888036370277405;such divergence remains in line with business cycle regularities with turning points in the growth of loans to enterprises typically lagging those in economic activity
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9395562410354614;in the case of households the latest data provide further confirmation of a levellingoff at low rates
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Positive;0.6181566119194031;in the case of nonfinancial corporations the decline in loans continues to reflect mainly a strong net redemption of loans with a shorter maturity while lending and borrowing at longer maturities remained positive
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9940365552902222;the subdued levels of production and trade as well as the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the business outlook will probably continue to dampen firms demand for bank financing in the months to come
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9890164136886597;in the meantime financing conditions for enterprises have improved over recent months in terms of the cost of both bank credit and market financing
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Positive;0.470682293176651;in this respect the continued negative flows in shortterm bank loans to nonfinancial corporations observed in recent months may partly reflect better possibilities for substitution with different sources of longerterm financing
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Negative;0.7691078186035156;banks have continued to reduce the size of their overall balance sheets mainly through downsizing the assets held visàvis other banks
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9742564558982849;the challenge remains to adjust the size and structure of balance sheets while ensuring the availability of credit to the nonfinancial sector
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9749068021774292;to address this challenge banks should use the improved funding conditions to strengthen further their capital bases and where necessary take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9898592829704285;to sum up the current key ecb interest rates remain appropriate
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.972806990146637;taking into account all the information and analyses that have become available since our meeting on 3 december 2009 price developments are expected to remain subdued over the policyrelevant horizon
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9870131611824036;the latest information has also confirmed that towards the end of 2009 euro area economic activity continued to expand
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Negative;0.700739860534668;however some of the factors supporting the growth in real gdp are of a temporary nature
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9902645349502563;overall the governing council expects the euro area economy to grow at a moderate pace in 2010 recognising that the recovery process is likely to be uneven and that the outlook remains subject to uncertainty
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.5986539125442505;a crosscheck of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressure over the medium term given the ongoing parallel decline in money and credit growth
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9268136620521545;all in all we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.989439070224762;medium to longerterm inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with the governing councils aim of keeping inflation rates below but close to 2 over the medium term
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9769617915153503;we will continue our enhanced credit support to the banking system while taking into account the ongoing improvement in financial market conditions and avoiding distortions associated with maintaining nonstandard measures for too long
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.982450008392334;the governing council will also continue to implement the gradual phasingout of the extraordinary liquidity measures that are not needed to the same extent as in the past
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9799681901931763;in order to counter effectively any threat to price stability over the medium to longer term the liquidity provided will be absorbed when necessary
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9682788252830505;accordingly we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Negative;0.970930814743042;as regards fiscal policies many euro area governments are faced with high and sharply rising fiscal imbalances
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9890706539154053;the very large government borrowing requirements carry the risk of triggering rapid changes in market sentiment leading to less favourable medium and longterm market interest rates
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Negative;0.988298237323761;this in turn would dampen private investment and thereby weaken the foundations for sustained growth
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9776819348335266;moreover high levels of public deficit and debt would place an additional burden on monetary policy and undermine the credibility of the provisions of both the treaty on european union and the stability and growth pact as a key pillar of economic and monetary union
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.5484867095947266;the governing council therefore calls upon governments to decide and implement in a timely fashion ambitious fiscal exit and consolidation strategies based on realistic growth assumptions with a strong focus on expenditure reforms
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9180833101272583;tax cuts should only be considered over the medium term when countries have regained sufficient room for budgetary manoeuvre
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.989602267742157;in this regard current government commitments to start consolidation in 2011 at the latest and to go well beyond the structural benchmark for adjustment of 05 of gdp per annum represent the minimum requirement for all euro area countries
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Positive;0.7087963223457336;the success of fiscal adjustment strategies will also depend crucially on appropriate national budgetary rules and institutions and requires transparent budgetary procedures as well as reliable and complete government finance statistics
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9247324466705322;turning to structural reforms an appropriate restructuring of the banking sector should play an important role
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9898961782455444;sound balance sheets effective risk management and transparent as well as robust business models are key to strengthening banks resilience to shocks thereby laying the foundations for sustainable economic growth and financial stability
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9863826036453247;the eurosystem will submit its response to the european commissions public consultation on the eu 2020 strategy which is designed as a successor to the current lisbon strategy
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9837950468063354;to address future challenges the eu 2020 strategy should focus on raising potential growth and creating high levels of employment through wellfunctioning labour and product markets sound financial systems and sustainable fiscal policies
2010-01-14;2010;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.5372102856636047;the aim is to achieve a highly competitive social market economy as spelled out in the treaty
