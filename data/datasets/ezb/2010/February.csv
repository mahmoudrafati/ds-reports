2010-02-04;2010;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.935492992401123;let me now explain our assessment in greater detail starting with the economic analysis
2010-02-04;2010;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9706982374191284;the latest information confirms that economic activity in the euro area continued to expand around the turn of the year
2010-02-04;2010;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9920742511749268;the euro area has been benefiting from a turn in the inventory cycle and a recovery in exports as well as from the significant macroeconomic stimulus under way and the measures adopted to restore the functioning of the financial system
2010-02-04;2010;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9875033497810364;however these stimuli will unwind over time while activity is likely to be adversely affected by the ongoing process of balance sheet adjustment in the financial and nonfinancial sectors both inside and outside the euro area
2010-02-04;2010;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9862100481987;in addition low capacity utilisation rates are likely to dampen investment and unemployment in the euro area is expected to increase somewhat further thereby lowering consumption growth
2010-02-04;2010;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9768983721733093;for these reasons the euro area economy is expected to grow only at a moderate pace in 2010 and the recovery process could be uneven
2010-02-04;2010;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9660271406173706;the governing council continues to view the risks to this outlook as broadly balanced
2010-02-04;2010;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9904807209968567;on the upside confidence may improve more than expected and both the global economy and foreign trade may recover more strongly than projected
2010-02-04;2010;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9914402961730957;furthermore there may be stronger than anticipated effects stemming from the extensive macroeconomic stimulus being provided and from other policy measures taken
2010-02-04;2010;February;REPORT;Negative;0.981342077255249;on the downside concerns remain relating to a stronger or more protracted than expected negative feedback loop between the real economy and the financial sector renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices the intensification of protectionist pressures and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances
2010-02-04;2010;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9750643372535706;with regard to price developments euro area annual hicp inflation increased further in january 2010 to stand at 10 according to eurostats flash estimate after 09 in december 2009 inflation is expected to be around 1 in the near term and to remain moderate over the policyrelevant horizon
2010-02-04;2010;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9850430488586426;in line with a slow recovery in demand in the euro area and elsewhere overall price cost and wage developments are expected to stay subdued
2010-02-04;2010;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9908587336540222;in this context it is important to emphasise that inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the governing councils aim of keeping inflation rates below but close to 2 over the medium term
2010-02-04;2010;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8692217469215393;risks to this outlook remain broadly balanced
2010-02-04;2010;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9745104312896729;they relate in particular to the further development of economic activity and the evolution of commodity prices
2010-02-04;2010;February;REPORT;Positive;0.987246036529541;furthermore increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be stronger than currently expected owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years
2010-02-04;2010;February;REPORT;Negative;0.5865408778190613;turning to the monetary analysis the annual growth rate of m3 remained negative in december 2009 standing at 02
2010-02-04;2010;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9449576139450073;in the same period annual growth in loans to the private sector was zero
2010-02-04;2010;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9433653950691223;these data continue to support our assessment of a moderate underlying pace of monetary expansion and low inflationary pressures over the medium term
2010-02-04;2010;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9941343665122986;actual monetary developments are likely to be weaker than the underlying pace of monetary expansion owing to the downward impact of the rather steep yield curve
2010-02-04;2010;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9948862195014954;looking ahead m3 and credit growth is likely to remain weak for some time to come
2010-02-04;2010;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9876853227615356;the prevailing interest rate constellation continues to have a strong influence on both the level and composition of annual m3 growth
2010-02-04;2010;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9375397562980652;on the one hand the low rates of remuneration on shortterm bank deposits foster the allocation of funds away from m3 and into longerterm deposits and securities
2010-02-04;2010;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9891664385795593;on the other hand the narrow spreads between the interest rates paid on different shortterm deposits imply a low opportunity cost of holding funds in the most liquid components included in m1 which continued to grow at a robust annual rate of more than 12 in december
2010-02-04;2010;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.5830370783805847;the zero annual growth rate of bank loans to the private sector reflects a further increase in the growth in loans to households while the annual growth in loans to nonfinancial corporations moved further into negative territory
2010-02-04;2010;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9221648573875427;such divergence remains in line with business cycle regularities
2010-02-04;2010;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9801644682884216;the ongoing contraction in the outstanding amounts of loans to nonfinancial corporations continues to be accounted for entirely by a strong net redemption of loans with a short maturity
2010-02-04;2010;February;REPORT;Negative;0.984157383441925;for the sector as a whole the overall contraction may be due partly to substitution with marketbased financing
2010-02-04;2010;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9942857623100281;given the typical lags between turning points in economic activity and those in the demand for bank loans growth in loans can be expected to remain weak over the months to come
2010-02-04;2010;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9725362062454224;in the meantime the real cost of external financing for nonfinancial enterprises has declined further while the net tightening of credit standards applied by banks has continued to diminish as indicated by the bank lending survey for the last quarter of 2009 at the same time banks have continued to reduce the size of their overall balance sheets over the past few months
2010-02-04;2010;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9615844488143921;in this respect the challenge remains for banks to adjust the size and structure of their balance sheets while ensuring the availability of credit to the nonfinancial sector
2010-02-04;2010;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9736190438270569;to address this challenge banks should use the improved funding conditions to strengthen their capital bases further and where necessary take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation
2010-02-04;2010;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9371952414512634;this is important to facilitate access to finance especially for those enterprises that do not have recourse to marketbased financing
2010-02-04;2010;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9898592829704285;to sum up the current key ecb interest rates remain appropriate

2010-02-04;2010;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9799681901931763;in order to counter effectively any threat to price stability over the medium to longer term the liquidity provided will be absorbed when necessary
2010-02-04;2010;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9682788252830505;accordingly we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead
2010-02-04;2010;February;REPORT;Negative;0.992733359336853;as regards fiscal policies many euro area countries are faced with large sharply rising fiscal imbalances leading to less favourable medium and longterm interest rates and lower levels of private investment
2010-02-04;2010;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9902668595314026;moreover high levels of public deficit and debt place an additional burden on monetary policy and undermine the stability and growth pact as a key pillar of economic and monetary union
2010-02-04;2010;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.979130208492279;against this background it is of paramount importance that the stability programme of each euro area country clearly defines the fiscal exit and consolidation strategies for the period ahead
2010-02-04;2010;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9809426069259644;countries will be required to meet their commitments under the excessive deficit procedures
2010-02-04;2010;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9873018264770508;consolidation of public finances should start in 2011 at the latest and will have to exceed substantially the annual adjustment of 05 of gdp set as a minimum requirement by the stability and growth pact
2010-02-04;2010;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9790175557136536;a strong focus on expenditure reforms is needed
2010-02-04;2010;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9843956232070923;the key challenge in order to reinforce sustainable growth and job creation is to accelerate structural reforms as the financial crisis has negatively affected the productive capacity of our economies
2010-02-04;2010;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.7585225701332092;in the case of product markets policies that enhance competition and innovation are urgently needed to speed up restructuring and investment and to create new business opportunities
