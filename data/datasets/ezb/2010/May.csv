2010-05-06;2010;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.935492992401123;let me now explain our assessment in greater detail starting with the economic analysis
2010-05-06;2010;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9775502681732178;euro area economic activity has been expanding since mid2009 after a period of sharp decline
2010-05-06;2010;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9905235171318054;notably the economy has benefited from the ongoing recovery in the world economy the significant macroeconomic stimulus provided and the measures adopted to restore the functioning of the banking system
2010-05-06;2010;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9861374497413635;recent economic data  including positive survey indicators  support the view that the economic recovery in the euro area is continuing in 2010 while adverse weather conditions in particular dampened growth in the early part of the year some strengthening appears to be taking place during the spring
2010-05-06;2010;May;REPORT;Positive;0.7109019756317139;looking ahead the governing council expects real gdp to expand at a moderate pace
2010-05-06;2010;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9898466467857361;the ongoing recovery at the global level and its impact on the demand for euro area exports should provide support to the euro area economy
2010-05-06;2010;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9935505390167236;at the same time the financial crisis is expected to have a dampening effect on economic growth given the ongoing process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors and the expectation of low capacity utilisation and weak labour market prospects
2010-05-06;2010;May;REPORT;Negative;0.6554102897644043;the governing council continues to view the risks to this outlook as broadly balanced in an environment of high uncertainty
2010-05-06;2010;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9845407605171204;on the upside the global economy and foreign trade may recover more strongly than projected and confidence may improve more than expected with the result that the recovery becomes selfsustained
2010-05-06;2010;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9931055903434753;on the downside concerns remain relating to renewed tensions in some financial market segments
2010-05-06;2010;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9451951384544373;in addition a stronger or more protracted than expected negative feedback loop between the real economy and the financial sector renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices and the intensification of protectionist pressures as well as the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances may weigh on the downside
2010-05-06;2010;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9903920888900757;with regard to price developments euro area annual hicp inflation was 15 in april 2010 according to eurostats flash estimate after 14 in march
2010-05-06;2010;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9915437698364258;this is somewhat higher than expected a few months ago and appears to be related in particular to upward pressure in energy prices
2010-05-06;2010;May;REPORT;Negative;0.6053985357284546;looking ahead global inflationary pressures may increase driven mainly by price developments in commodity markets and in fastgrowing economic regions of the world while euro area domestic price pressures are still expected to remain contained
2010-05-06;2010;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9814881086349487;as a result overall inflation rates are expected to be moderate over the policyrelevant horizon
2010-05-06;2010;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9922731518745422;inflation expectations over the medium to longer term continue to be firmly anchored in line with the governing councils aim of keeping inflation rates below but close to 2 over the medium term
2010-05-06;2010;May;REPORT;Negative;0.4816780388355255;in the near term given the developments in energy prices risks to earlier projections for hicp inflation are tilted somewhat towards the upside while risks to price stability over the medium term are viewed as still remaining broadly balanced
2010-05-06;2010;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.4897812008857727;upside risks over the medium term relate in particular to the evolution of commodity prices
2010-05-06;2010;May;REPORT;Negative;0.75515216588974;furthermore increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be greater than currently expected owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years

2010-05-06;2010;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.966116189956665;overall we need to monitor closely the future evolution of all available price indicators
2010-05-06;2010;May;REPORT;Negative;0.6209565997123718;turning to the monetary analysis the annual growth rate of m3 remained slightly negative at 01 in march 2010 together with the continued negative annual growth in loans to the private sector  02 in march  the latest data further support the assessment that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is moderate and that the inflationary pressures over the medium term are contained
2010-05-06;2010;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9949028491973877;shorterterm developments in m3 and loans have also remained muted
2010-05-06;2010;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9939180612564087;the actual growth in m3 is seen as weaker than the underlying pace of monetary expansion as the rather steep yield curve continues to foster the allocation of funds into longerterm deposits and securities outside m3
2010-05-06;2010;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.5227642059326172;at the same time the still narrow spreads between the interest rates paid on different m3 instruments imply low opportunity costs of allocating funds to overnight deposits rather than other m3 instruments
2010-05-06;2010;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9783088564872742;this is reflected in the continued marked difference between weak annual growth in m3 and strong annual growth in m1 which was 109 in march
2010-05-06;2010;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9908758401870728;however with the current interest rate constellation already in place for some time the latest data suggest that the large shifts in the allocations of funds are waning
2010-05-06;2010;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9893836379051208;the annual growth of bank loans to the private sector remained negative in march but this conceals a further positive monthly flow
2010-05-06;2010;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9069539308547974;it also conceals ongoing opposite developments at the sectoral level with positive increasing annual growth in loans to households on the one side and negative annual growth in loans to nonfinancial corporations on the other side
2010-05-06;2010;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9578214883804321;while the lagged response of loans to nonfinancial corporations to economic activity is a normal feature of the business cycle the data over the past few months point to a possible discontinuation of the earlier downward trend in annual loan growth
2010-05-06;2010;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.7519140839576721;the latest data also confirm that the reduction in the size of banks overall balance sheets has not continued since the turn of the year
2010-05-06;2010;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9614422917366028;however further adjustments cannot be ruled out and the challenge remains for banks to expand the availability of credit to the nonfinancial sector when demand picks up
2010-05-06;2010;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9744406938552856;to address this challenge banks should turn to the market and use present funding conditions to strengthen further their capital bases
2010-05-06;2010;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9898592829704285;to sum up the current key ecb interest rates remain appropriate

2010-05-06;2010;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.8290696740150452;as regards fiscal policies we call for decisive actions by governments to achieve a lasting and credible consolidation of public finances
2010-05-06;2010;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.972682535648346;the latest information shows that the correction of the large fiscal imbalances will in general require a steppingup of current efforts
2010-05-06;2010;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9633572697639465;fiscal consolidation will need to exceed substantially the annual structural adjustment of 05 of gdp set as a minimum requirement by the stability and growth pact
2010-05-06;2010;May;REPORT;Negative;0.8465766906738281;the longer the fiscal correction is postponed the greater the adjustment needs become and the higher the risk of reputational and confidence losses
2010-05-06;2010;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9897067546844482;instead the swift implementation of frontloaded and comprehensive consolidation plans focusing on the expenditure side and combined with structural reforms will strengthen public confidence in the capacity of governments to regain sustainability of public finances reduce risk premia in interest rates and thus support sustainable growth over the medium term
2010-05-06;2010;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9259220957756042;in this context the governing council welcomes the economic and financial adjustment programme which was approved by the greek government following the successful conclusion of the negotiations with the european commission in liaison with the ecb and the international monetary fund with a view to safeguarding financial stability in the euro area as a whole
2010-05-06;2010;May;REPORT;Positive;0.7589418292045593;for all euro area countries structural reforms leading to higher growth and employment are crucial to support a sustainable recovery

2010-05-06;2010;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.7611498832702637;at the same time existing competitiveness problems as well as domestic and external imbalances need to be urgently addressed by the countries concerned
2010-05-06;2010;May;REPORT;Negative;0.7178459763526917;to that end wagebargaining institutions that allow wages to adjust appropriately to losses in competitiveness and the unemployment situation are indispensable
2010-05-06;2010;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.5500828623771667;likewise measures that increase price flexibility and nonprice competitiveness are essential
2010-05-06;2010;May;REPORT;Positive;0.96015465259552;finally an appropriate restructuring of the banking sector should play an important role
