2010-12-02;2010;December;REPORT;Positive;0.990003764629364;at the same time private sector domestic demand should increasingly contribute to growth supported by the accommodative monetary policy stance and the measures adopted to restore the functioning of the financial system
2010-12-02;2010;December;REPORT;Negative;0.990675151348114;however the recovery in activity is expected to be dampened by the process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors
2010-12-02;2010;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9841669201850891;this assessment is also reflected in the december 2010 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area according to which annual real gdp growth will range between 16 and 18 in 2010 between 07 and 21 in 2011 and between 06 and 28 in 2012 compared with the september 2010 ecb staff macroeconomic projections the range for 2010 has narrowed somewhat and shifted towards the upper end of septembers range while the range for 2011 is slightly narrower

2010-12-02;2010;December;REPORT;Negative;0.983109176158905;on the other hand downside risks relate to the tensions in some segments of the financial markets and their potential spillover to the euro area real economy
2010-12-02;2010;December;REPORT;Negative;0.9889366626739502;further downside risks relate to renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices protectionist pressures and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances

2010-12-02;2010;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9437293410301208;risks to the outlook for price developments are broadly balanced

2010-12-02;2010;December;REPORT;Negative;0.7188650965690613;broad money and loan growth hence remained low supporting the assessment that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is moderate and that inflationary pressures over the medium term are contained
2010-12-02;2010;December;REPORT;Negative;0.9201053977012634;the steepness of the yield curve has continued to lessen somewhat implying a gradual softening of the dampening impact on m3 that was associated with shifts of funds from monetary assets to longerterm financial assets outside m3

2010-12-02;2010;December;REPORT;Positive;0.8927117586135864;the annual growth rate of bank loans to the private sector continues to conceal positive growth in loans to households with 29 in october after 28 in september and still negative growth in loans to nonfinancial corporations which stood at 06 in october unchanged from september
2010-12-02;2010;December;REPORT;Positive;0.972714364528656;when correcting for the impact of derecognition of loans from bank balance sheets the growth in loans to nonfinancial corporations continued to strengthen further confirming that a turning point was reached earlier in 2010 over the past few months banks have generally stabilised the size of their balance sheets while expanding the provision of credit to the private sector
2010-12-02;2010;December;REPORT;Negative;0.9838755130767822;however the challenge remains to expand the availability of such credit when demand picks up further
2010-12-02;2010;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.8978808522224426;to address this challenge where necessary it is essential for banks to retain earnings to turn to the market to strengthen further their capital bases or to take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation
2010-12-02;2010;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9898592829704285;to sum up the current key ecb interest rates remain appropriate
