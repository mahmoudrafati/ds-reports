2010-06-10;2010;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.935492992401123;let me now explain our assessment in greater detail starting with the economic analysis
2010-06-10;2010;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9854052662849426;after a period of sharp decline euro area economic activity has been expanding since mid2009
2010-06-10;2010;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9884322285652161;according to eurostats first estimate euro area real gdp increased on a quarterly basis by 02 in the first quarter of 2010 while adverse weather conditions in particular dampened growth in the early part of the year the latest economic indicators suggest that a rebound took place during the spring
2010-06-10;2010;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9921073317527771;looking ahead the governing council expects real gdp to grow at a moderate and still uneven pace over time and across economies and sectors of the euro area
2010-06-10;2010;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9874936938285828;the ongoing recovery at the global level and its impact on the demand for euro area exports together with the accommodative monetary policy stance and the measures adopted to restore the functioning of the financial system should provide support to the euro area economy
2010-06-10;2010;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9926562905311584;however the recovery of activity is expected to be dampened by the process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors and weak labour market prospects
2010-06-10;2010;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9076599478721619;this assessment is also reflected in the june 2010 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area according to which annual real gdp growth will range between 07 and 13 in 2010 and between 02 and 22 in 2011 compared with the march 2010 ecb staff macroeconomic projections the range for real gdp growth this year has been revised slightly upwards owing to the positive impact of stronger activity worldwide in the short run while the range has been revised somewhat downwards for 2011 reflecting mainly domestic demand prospects
2010-06-10;2010;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.985762357711792;the june 2010 eurosystem staff projections are broadly in line with forecasts by international organisations
2010-06-10;2010;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.5930803418159485;in the governing councils assessment the risks to the economic outlook are broadly balanced in an environment of unusually high uncertainty
2010-06-10;2010;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9889006614685059;on the upside the global economy and foreign trade may recover more strongly than projected thereby further supporting euro area exports
2010-06-10;2010;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9945025444030762;on the downside concerns remain relating to renewed tensions in some financial market segments and related confidence effects
2010-06-10;2010;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9568378329277039;in addition a stronger or more protracted than expected negative feedback loop between the real economy and the financial sector renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices and protectionist pressures as well as the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances may weigh on the downside
2010-06-10;2010;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9902563095092773;with regard to price developments euro area annual hicp inflation was 16 in may 2010 according to eurostats flash estimate after 15 in april
2010-06-10;2010;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.8748947381973267;the rise in inflation over recent months mostly reflects higher energy prices
2010-06-10;2010;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9802143573760986;during the second half of this year some further slight increases in hicp inflation cannot be excluded
2010-06-10;2010;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.8687766194343567;looking further ahead inflation rates should overall remain moderate
2010-06-10;2010;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9907851219177246;upward pressures on commodity prices may persist while euro area domestic price pressures are expected to remain low
2010-06-10;2010;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9922731518745422;inflation expectations over the medium to longer term continue to be firmly anchored in line with the governing councils aim of keeping inflation rates below but close to 2 over the medium term
2010-06-10;2010;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9827462434768677;this assessment is also reflected in the june 2010 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area which foresee annual hicp inflation in a range between 14 and 16 for 2010 and between 10 and 22 for 2011 compared with the ecb staff projections of march 2010 the ranges have been adjusted somewhat upwards mainly reflecting higher euro prices for commodities
2010-06-10;2010;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9808593392372131;available forecasts from international organisations provide a broadly similar picture
2010-06-10;2010;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9437293410301208;risks to the outlook for price developments are broadly balanced
2010-06-10;2010;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.4897812008857727;upside risks over the medium term relate in particular to the evolution of commodity prices
2010-06-10;2010;June;REPORT;Negative;0.75515216588974;furthermore increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be greater than currently expected owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years
2010-06-10;2010;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9082889556884766;at the same time risks to domestic price and cost developments are contained
2010-06-10;2010;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9894982576370239;overall the governing council will monitor closely the future evolution of all available price indicators
2010-06-10;2010;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9931446313858032;turning to the monetary analysis the annual growth rate of m3 was unchanged at 01 in april 2010 the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector increased somewhat further and turned positive but remained weak at 01
2010-06-10;2010;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.988108217716217;together these data continue to support the assessment that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is moderate and that inflationary pressures over the medium term are contained
2010-06-10;2010;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9841078519821167;shorterterm developments in m3 and loans have remained volatile and given the renewed tensions in some financial market segments volatility in m3 and its components may well continue
2010-06-10;2010;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9912760257720947;the actual growth in m3 continues to understate the underlying pace of monetary expansion but the downward impact of the rather steep yield curve and the associated allocation of funds to longerterm deposits and securities outside m3 appear to be gradually waning
2010-06-10;2010;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9921886920928955;the same holds for the shifts within m3 that have been observed as a response to the narrow spreads between the interest rates paid on different m3 instruments
2010-06-10;2010;June;REPORT;Positive;0.7603273391723633;at 107 annual m1 growth is still very strong
2010-06-10;2010;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9932690262794495;the still weak annual growth rate of bank loans to the private sector conceals the fact that monthly flows have now been positive for a number of months
2010-06-10;2010;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9881134629249573;at the same time these aggregate developments continue to reflect mainly an ongoing strengthening in the annual growth of loans to households while the annual growth of loans to nonfinancial corporations has remained negative
2010-06-10;2010;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9788914322853088;a lagged response of loans to nonfinancial corporations to economic activity is a normal feature of the business cycle
2010-06-10;2010;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.7827929258346558;the latest data confirm that the reduction in the size of banks overall balance sheets has not continued since the turn of the year
2010-06-10;2010;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9614422917366028;however further adjustments cannot be ruled out and the challenge remains for banks to expand the availability of credit to the nonfinancial sector when demand picks up
2010-06-10;2010;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9464722275733948;to address this challenge banks should turn to the market to strengthen further their capital bases and where necessary take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation
2010-06-10;2010;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9898592829704285;to sum up the current key ecb interest rates remain appropriate

2010-06-10;2010;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9933663010597229;a crosscheck of the outcome of our economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressures over the medium term remain contained as suggested by weak money and credit growth

2010-06-10;2010;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.522796094417572;it is essential that all countries stick to their commitments to correct high budget deficits and government debt and reduce fiscal vulnerability
2010-06-10;2010;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9866423606872559;to this end the concrete adjustment measures needed to achieve the budgetary targets should be fully specified
