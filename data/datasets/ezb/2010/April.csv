2010-04-08;2010;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.935492992401123;let me now explain our assessment in greater detail starting with the economic analysis
2010-04-08;2010;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9863858222961426;benefiting from the ongoing recovery in the world economy the significant macroeconomic stimulus provided and the measures adopted to restore the functioning of the banking system the euro area economy grew by 04 in the third quarter of 2009 after a period of sharp decline while in the fourth quarter real gdp was flat according to eurostats second release
2010-04-08;2010;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9893331527709961;available indicators in particular further positive information from business surveys suggest that the economic recovery in the euro area continued in the early months of 2010 although it may have been affected by a number of special factors including adverse weather conditions
2010-04-08;2010;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9611787796020508;as a consequence euro area real gdp growth is likely to have remained uneven around the turn of the year making it advisable to look through the quarterly volatility and to compare growth developments on a halfyearly basis
2010-04-08;2010;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9810549020767212;looking ahead the governing council expects real gdp growth to continue to expand at a moderate pace in 2010 owing to the ongoing process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors and the expectation that low capacity utilisation is likely to dampen investment and that consumption is being hampered by weak labour market prospects
2010-04-08;2010;April;REPORT;Negative;0.6751335859298706;the governing council continues to view the risks to this outlook as broadly balanced in an environment of uncertainty
2010-04-08;2010;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9806779026985168;on the upside the global economy and foreign trade may recover more strongly than projected and confidence may improve more than expected
2010-04-08;2010;April;REPORT;Negative;0.7085645794868469;furthermore there may be greater than anticipated effects stemming from the extensive macroeconomic stimulus being provided and from other policy measures taken
2010-04-08;2010;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9306555390357971;on the downside concerns remain relating to renewed tensions in some financial market segments a stronger or more protracted than expected negative feedback loop between the real economy and the financial sector renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices and the intensification of protectionist pressures as well as the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances
2010-04-08;2010;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9900063872337341;with regard to price developments euro area annual hicp inflation was 15 in march 2010 according to eurostats flash estimate after 09 in february
2010-04-08;2010;April;REPORT;Positive;0.4013180434703827;while no breakdown of overall hicp developments is available yet this higher than expected outcome may be related in particular to the energy component as well as food prices possibly partly as a result of weather conditions
2010-04-08;2010;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9874935746192932;inflation is expected to remain moderate over the policyrelevant horizon in line with a slow recovery in domestic and foreign demand overall price cost and wage developments are expected to stay subdued
2010-04-08;2010;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9912063479423523;inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the governing councils aim of keeping inflation rates below but close to 2 over the medium term
2010-04-08;2010;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8692217469215393;risks to this outlook remain broadly balanced
2010-04-08;2010;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9710034132003784;they relate in particular to further developments in economic activity and the evolution of commodity prices
2010-04-08;2010;April;REPORT;Negative;0.75515216588974;furthermore increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be greater than currently expected owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years
2010-04-08;2010;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9703319668769836;turning to the monetary analysis the annual growth rate of m3 was 04 in february
2010-04-08;2010;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9943138360977173;annual growth in loans to the private sector also remained weak at 04 despite a positive flow in the month
2010-04-08;2010;April;REPORT;Negative;0.6049453020095825;overall the latest data continue to support the assessment that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is moderate and that in the medium term the inflationary pressures associated with monetary developments are low
2010-04-08;2010;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9947811961174011;the growth of m3 and loans is likely to remain weak also in the coming months
2010-04-08;2010;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9943214654922485;the continued steep yield curve fosters the allocation of funds into longerterm deposits and securities outside m3 and implies that actual m3 growth is weaker than the underlying pace of monetary expansion
2010-04-08;2010;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9897260069847107;at the same time the narrow spreads between the interest rates paid on different m3 instruments imply low opportunity costs of holding funds in the most liquid components included in m1 which continued to grow at a robust annual rate of 109 in february
2010-04-08;2010;April;REPORT;Negative;0.7362688183784485;however the monthly flows in the components of m3 were generally small in february suggesting that the strong impact of the prevailing interest rate constellation may be progressively waning
2010-04-08;2010;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9644545912742615;the negative annual growth of bank loans to the private sector continues to conceal countervailing developments positive strengthening annual growth in loans to households on the one hand and negative annual growth in loans to nonfinancial corporations on the other hand
2010-04-08;2010;April;REPORT;Negative;0.7720266580581665;at the same time the flow of loans to firms in february was positive for the first time since august 2009 and halted the decline in the annual growth rate
2010-04-08;2010;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.5924981832504272;such positive shortterm developments need to be assessed with caution owing to the volatility in monthly data
2010-04-08;2010;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9950622916221619;in addition it is a normal feature of the business cycle that loans to nonfinancial corporations remain weak for some time after economic activity has picked up
2010-04-08;2010;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9413464069366455;the reduction in the size of banks overall balance sheets appears to have come to a halt in the early months of 2010 however the challenge remains for them to manage possible further adjustments while at the same time ensuring the availability of credit to the nonfinancial sector
2010-04-08;2010;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9736190438270569;to address this challenge banks should use the improved funding conditions to strengthen their capital bases further and where necessary take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation
2010-04-08;2010;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9898592829704285;to sum up the current key ecb interest rates remain appropriate
2010-04-08;2010;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9124220013618469;taking into account all the information and analyses that have become available since our meeting on 4 march 2010 price developments are expected to remain moderate over the policyrelevant horizon

2010-04-08;2010;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9614375233650208;a crosscheck of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressures over the medium term
2010-04-08;2010;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9268136620521545;all in all we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households

2010-04-08;2010;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9803099036216736;in a number of euro area countries fiscal consolidation will start this year and in all others corrective measures will need to be in place by 2011 at the latest
2010-04-08;2010;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.7168211340904236;fiscal consolidation will need to exceed substantially the annual structural adjustment of 05 of gdp set as a minimum requirement by the stability and growth pact and there is a need to fully define and implement credible fiscal adjustment strategies
2010-04-08;2010;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.7788261771202087;this requires determined efforts notably on the part of countries with high government deficit and debttogdp ratios not least in view of the expected rising budgetary costs associated with an ageing population
2010-04-08;2010;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9790175557136536;a strong focus on expenditure reforms is needed
