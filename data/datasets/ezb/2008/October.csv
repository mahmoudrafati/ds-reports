2008-10-02;2008;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9948447942733765;the most recent data clearly confirm that economic activity in the euro area is weakening with contracting domestic demand and tighter financing conditions
2008-10-02;2008;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9302154779434204;at the same time annual inflation rates are likely to remain well above levels consistent with price stability for some time
2008-10-02;2008;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.6138165593147278;with the weakening of demand upside risks to price stability have diminished somewhat but they have not disappeared
2008-10-02;2008;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9502107501029968;while the still strong underlying pace of monetary expansion points to upside risks to price stability over the medium term the growth of broad money and credit aggregates is showing some further signs of moderation

2008-10-02;2008;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9709766507148743;all parties concerned face exceptional challenges and are called upon to meet their responsibilities accordingly we confirm that we remain determined to secure price stability in the medium term and will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead
2008-10-02;2008;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9419136047363281;allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail starting with the economic analysis
2008-10-02;2008;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9919163584709167;when analysing current developments in economic activity it needs to be stressed that we face an extraordinarily high degree of uncertainty in large part stemming from the recent intensification of the financial market turmoil
2008-10-02;2008;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.92094886302948;this complicates any assessment of the near to mediumterm economic prospects
2008-10-02;2008;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9930203557014465;as the world economy as a whole is feeling the adverse effects of the intensified and prolonged financial market turmoil the most recent data clearly confirm that economic activity in the euro area is weakening with contracting domestic demand and tighter financing conditions
2008-10-02;2008;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9588525891304016;the fall in oil prices from their peak in july and ongoing growth in emerging market economies might support a gradual recovery in the course of 2009 in the view of the governing council the economic outlook is subject to increased downside risks mainly stemming from a scenario of ongoing financial market tensions affecting the real economy more adversely than currently foreseen
2008-10-02;2008;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9812389612197876;other downside risks relate to the possibility of renewed increases in highly volatile energy and food prices disorderly developments owing to global imbalances and rising protectionist pressures
2008-10-02;2008;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9778577089309692;with regard to price developments annual hicp inflation has remained considerably above the level consistent with price stability since last autumn standing at 36 in september according to eurostats flash estimate after 38 in august
2008-10-02;2008;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.5093527436256409;this still worrying level of inflation is largely the consequence of both the direct and indirect effects of past surges in energy and food prices at the global level
2008-10-02;2008;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9818565249443054;moreover wage growth has been picking up rather strongly in recent quarters in spite of a weaker growth momentum and at a time when labour productivity growth has decelerated
2008-10-02;2008;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.6520670056343079;this resulted in a sharp increase in the yearonyear unit labour cost  to 34  in the second quarter of this year after several years of more moderate increases in the order of 11Â½
2008-10-02;2008;October;REPORT;Positive;0.8888986706733704;looking ahead on the basis of current commodity futures prices annual hicp inflation rates are likely to remain well above levels consistent with price stability for some time moderating gradually during the course of 2009 at the policyrelevant mediumterm horizon taking into account the weakening in demand upside risks to price stability have diminished somewhat but they have not disappeared
2008-10-02;2008;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9830920100212097;they include the possibility of previous commodity price rises having further and stronger indirect effects on consumer prices as well as a renewed increase in commodity prices
2008-10-02;2008;October;REPORT;Negative;0.989257276058197;in particular there is a very strong concern that the emergence of broadbased secondround effects in price and wagesetting behaviour could add significantly to inflationary pressures
2008-10-02;2008;October;REPORT;Negative;0.8596123456954956;moreover unexpected rises in indirect taxes and administered prices could occur
2008-10-02;2008;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.5529949069023132;against this background it is imperative to ensure that medium to longerterm inflation expectations remain firmly anchored at levels in line with price stability
2008-10-02;2008;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9884467124938965;this is all the more the case in an environment of very high uncertainty
2008-10-02;2008;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9698306322097778;broadbased secondround effects stemming from the impact of past energy and food price increases on price and wagesetting behaviour must be avoided
2008-10-02;2008;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9864237904548645;the governing council is monitoring pricesetting behaviour and wage negotiations in the euro area with particular attention
2008-10-02;2008;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9839748740196228;we have repeatedly expressed our concern about the existence of schemes in which nominal wages are indexed to consumer prices
2008-10-02;2008;October;REPORT;Negative;0.981823742389679;such schemes involve the risk of upward shocks in inflation leading to a wageprice spiral which would be detrimental to employment and competitiveness in the countries concerned
2008-10-02;2008;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9749032855033875;the governing council calls for these schemes to be abolished
2008-10-02;2008;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.6136847138404846;turning to the monetary analysis we need to recognise that the latest monetary data refer to the end of august and thus do not yet embody the impact of the recent intensification of the financial market turmoil
2008-10-02;2008;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9784850478172302;further data on this impact will be carefully evaluated
2008-10-02;2008;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8795419931411743;as a general observation previous episodes suggest that financial market tensions can have a relatively limited impact on monetary developments but they have also been associated with large portfolio shifts and thus have exerted significant influence on monetary data
2008-10-02;2008;October;REPORT;Negative;0.982756495475769;while the still strong underlying pace of monetary expansion points to upside risks to price stability over the medium term data up to august show that the growth of broad money and credit aggregates moderated over the past few months reflecting the monetary policy decisions taken since 2005 to address risks to price stability
2008-10-02;2008;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9580682516098022;as a more detailed examination shows the flat yield curve and the structure of bank deposit rates have led to a number of substitution effects
2008-10-02;2008;October;REPORT;Positive;0.958746612071991;first there has been a substitution from longerterm maturity assets into instruments covered by m3 which offer similar remuneration but greater liquidity and less risk
2008-10-02;2008;October;REPORT;Negative;0.816153347492218;as a consequence the annual growth rate of m3 probably overstates the underlying pace of monetary expansion
2008-10-02;2008;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8976714015007019;second there have been substitution effects within m3
2008-10-02;2008;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9941412806510925;in contrast to the dynamic developments in m3 annual m1 growth has fallen to very low levels
2008-10-02;2008;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9641562700271606;this reflects relatively attractive interest rates for time deposits which have increased the opportunity cost of holding cash or overnight deposits
2008-10-02;2008;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9898277521133423;although at the level of the euro area as a whole the availability of bank credit has as yet not been significantly affected by the ongoing financial tensions the gradual moderation of growth in loans continued in the august data as previously anticipated with corporate demand for credit slowing
2008-10-02;2008;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9940000772476196;at the same time the growth of loans to households continues to follow the downward trend observed over the past few years as a result of higher shortterm interest rates and housing market weakness in several parts of the euro area
2008-10-02;2008;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9856756329536438;to sum up we discussed extensively the recent intensification of the financial market turmoil and its possible impact on economic activity and inflation recognising the extraordinarily high level of uncertainty stemming from latest developments
2008-10-02;2008;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9542234539985657;in this context we stressed how crucial it is for monetary policy to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with our objective
2008-10-02;2008;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9765011668205261;price stability fosters an efficient allocation of resources contains inflation risk premia and longerterm financing costs and preserves the purchasing power of our currency
2008-10-02;2008;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9819112420082092;in so doing it supports sustainable growth and employment and contributes to financial stability
2008-10-02;2008;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9948447942733765;the most recent data clearly confirm that economic activity in the euro area is weakening with contracting domestic demand and tighter financing conditions
2008-10-02;2008;October;REPORT;Positive;0.6506383419036865;the crosscheck of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis clearly confirms that annual inflation rates are likely to remain well above levels consistent with price stability for some time and when taking into account the weakening of demand that upside risks to price stability have diminished somewhat but they have not disappeared
2008-10-02;2008;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9502107501029968;while the still strong underlying pace of monetary expansion points to upside risks to price stability over the medium term the growth of broad money and credit aggregates is showing some further signs of moderation
2008-10-02;2008;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.6121897101402283;it is imperative to avoid broadbased secondround effects in price and wagesetting

2008-10-02;2008;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.7727993130683899;regarding fiscal policy in the current situation of continuing economic uncertainty it is essential that governments abide by the rules of the stability and growth pact and ensure the sustainability of public finances
2008-10-02;2008;October;REPORT;Positive;0.986386775970459;maintaining sound public finances will enable governments to let automatic stabilisers operate freely and thus contribute to smoothing the economic cycle and to supporting private sector confidence
2008-10-02;2008;October;REPORT;Positive;0.5524935722351074;turning to structural policies measures that foster competition and flexibility and promote moderate unit labour cost growth are of the utmost importance in the current economic circumstances
2008-10-02;2008;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9955299496650696;while moderate unit labour cost growth is crucial in all euro area countries it is particularly pressing in those that have experienced a significant loss of cost and price competitiveness over recent years and where unemployment has already started to rise
2008-10-02;2008;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9424371123313904;moreover labour market reforms fostering employment and investment and promoting skills innovation and efficiency remain essential to support growth and real incomes in the longer term
