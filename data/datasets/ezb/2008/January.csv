2008-01-10;2008;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9607121348381042;as regards the medium term and in a context of very vigorous money and credit growth our assessment of upside risks to price stability has been fully confirmed
2008-01-10;2008;January;REPORT;Positive;0.6064577102661133;the governing council remains prepared to act preemptively so that secondround effects and upside risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise and consequently medium and longterm inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with price stability
2008-01-10;2008;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.7993758916854858;reflecting its mandate such anchoring is of the highest priority to the governing council
2008-01-10;2008;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9667770862579346;the economic fundamentals of the euro area are sound
2008-01-10;2008;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9936216473579407;however the ongoing reappraisal of risk in financial markets is still accompanied by uncertainty about its potential impact on the real economy and the risks surrounding the outlook for economic activity are on the downside
2008-01-10;2008;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9681558609008789;we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the coming weeks
2008-01-10;2008;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9419136047363281;allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail starting with the economic analysis
2008-01-10;2008;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9788353443145752;the latest information on economic activity suggests that quarterly growth at the turn of the year was at a more moderate pace than the quarteronquarter rate of 08 observed in the third quarter of 2007 revised upwards from 07
2008-01-10;2008;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9379503726959229;this assessment is in line with indicators for business and consumer confidence which while declining over the past few months generally remain at levels that continue to point to ongoing growth
2008-01-10;2008;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.7677401304244995;our main scenario remains that of real gdp growth broadly in line with trend potential
2008-01-10;2008;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9791620969772339;the fundamentals of the euro area economy are sound profitability has been sustained employment growth has been robust and unemployment rates have fallen to levels not seen for 25 years
2008-01-10;2008;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9883212447166443;consumption growth should therefore continue to contribute to economic expansion in line with real disposable income and investment growth should provide ongoing support
2008-01-10;2008;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9909125566482544;on the expectation that the global economy will on balance remain resilient  with the slowdown in economic growth in the united states being mitigated by the continued strength of emerging market economies  external demand should support euro area exports
2008-01-10;2008;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9932267069816589;that said uncertainty about the prospects for economic growth remains high and the risks surrounding the outlook for economic activity lie on the downside
2008-01-10;2008;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9734020829200745;the latter relate mainly to a potentially broader than currently expected impact of the ongoing reappraisal of risk in financial markets on financing conditions and economic sentiment with a negative impact on world and euro area growth
2008-01-10;2008;January;REPORT;Negative;0.990519642829895;further downside risks stem from the scope for additional oil and other commodity price rises concerns about protectionist pressures and the possibility of disorderly developments due to global imbalances
2008-01-10;2008;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9909411072731018;with regard to price developments according to eurostats flash estimate the annual hicp inflation rate was 31 in december 2007 unchanged from november
2008-01-10;2008;January;REPORT;Positive;0.991036057472229;this confirms the strong upward pressure on inflation in the short term stemming mainly from strong increases in oil and food prices in recent months
2008-01-10;2008;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9752748608589172;looking ahead the annual hicp inflation rate is expected to remain significantly above 2 in the coming months and is likely to moderate only gradually in the course of 2008 hence the period of temporarily high rates of inflation would be somewhat more protracted than previously expected
2008-01-10;2008;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9591566920280457;moreover it is important to stress that the expectation of a moderation in the rate of inflation  which is embedded in the december 2007 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections  assumes some reversal of the recent rises in commodity prices  in line with what is currently captured by futures prices  and more fundamentally that recent oil and food price dynamics and their impact on hicp inflation do not have broadlybased secondround effects on wage and pricesetting behaviour
2008-01-10;2008;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.8174563050270081;risks to this mediumterm outlook for price developments are fully confirmed to lie on the upside
2008-01-10;2008;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9829360246658325;these risks include the possibility that stronger than currently expected wage growth may emerge taking into account capacity constraints and the positive developments in labour markets
2008-01-10;2008;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9901934266090393;furthermore the pricing power of firms  notably in market segments with low competition  could be stronger than expected
2008-01-10;2008;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9351356029510498;at this juncture it is imperative that all parties concerned meet their responsibilities and that secondround effects on wage and pricesetting stemming from current inflation rates be avoided
2008-01-10;2008;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.5663350224494934;in the view of the governing council this is absolutely essential in order to preserve price stability in the medium run and thereby the purchasing power of all euro area citizens
2008-01-10;2008;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9884766340255737;the governing council is monitoring wage negotiations in the euro area countries with particular attention
2008-01-10;2008;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9889740943908691;any indexation scheme of nominal wages to prices should be eliminated
2008-01-10;2008;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9166803359985352;finally further rises in oil and agricultural prices continuing the strong upward trend observed in recent months as well as increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those foreseen thus far could materialise
2008-01-10;2008;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.946990430355072;the monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longerterm horizons
2008-01-10;2008;January;REPORT;Positive;0.972329318523407;money and credit have both continued to grow vigorously in recent months
2008-01-10;2008;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.7675296664237976;the annual growth rate of m3 in november unchanged at 123 is likely to have been influenced by a number of temporary factors such as the flattening of the yield curve the financial market turmoil and specific transactions associated with the restructuring of certain banking groups
2008-01-10;2008;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9902939796447754;nonetheless even taking these special factors into account the underlying rate of monetary expansion remains strong
2008-01-10;2008;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9785469174385071;moreover the sustained expansion of loans to the domestic private sector which grew at an annual rate of 110 in november points to the continued vigour of underlying monetary dynamics
2008-01-10;2008;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9548032283782959;monetary developments continue to require very careful monitoring both to detect underlying trends associated with inflationary pressures at longer horizons and to form a better understanding of shorterterm monetary dynamics
2008-01-10;2008;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.971123993396759;such monitoring will also provide a more complete picture of the response of the private sector to the increased volatility in financial markets
2008-01-10;2008;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9512377381324768;a broad assessment of underlying trends in money and credit growth is particularly important at present given recent financial market developments
2008-01-10;2008;January;REPORT;Negative;0.8774281740188599;heightened financial volatility may influence the shortterm behaviour of moneyholders and thereby complicate the extraction of the underlying trend monetary developments
2008-01-10;2008;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.8890215158462524;at the same time monetary and credit data can also offer an important insight into how financial institutions households and firms have responded to the financial market turmoil
2008-01-10;2008;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9309854507446289;for the time being however there is little evidence that the financial market turbulence since early august 2007 has strongly influenced the dynamics of broad money and credit aggregates
2008-01-10;2008;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9095847606658936;indeed the growth of bank loans to the domestic private sector has remained robust in recent months which may suggest that the supply of credit has not been impaired thus far
2008-01-10;2008;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9933930039405823;the growth of m1 and household borrowing have moderated further over the past few quarters reflecting the impact of higher key ecb interest rates since december 2005 rather than the influence of the financial turmoil
2008-01-10;2008;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9854376316070557;borrowing by nonfinancial corporations remains very strong
2008-01-10;2008;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9762818217277527;further data and analysis will be required in order to obtain a more complete picture of the impact of the financial market developments on banks balance sheets financing conditions and money and credit growth
2008-01-10;2008;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9847086668014526;to sum up a crosscheck of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis fully confirms the assessment that there are upside risks to price stability over the medium term in a context of very vigorous money and credit growth and sound economic fundamentals in the euro area
2008-01-10;2008;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9870874881744385;at the same time the potential impact on the real economy of the ongoing reappraisal of risk in financial markets remains uncertain
2008-01-10;2008;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9732930064201355;consequently we will monitor very closely all developments
2008-01-10;2008;January;REPORT;Positive;0.8760738968849182;the governing council remains prepared to act preemptively so that secondround effects and upside risks to price stability do not materialise and consequently medium and longterm inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with price stability
2008-01-10;2008;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.7993758916854858;reflecting its mandate such anchoring is of the highest priority to the governing council
2008-01-10;2008;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9835280179977417;turning to fiscal policy most euro area countries have submitted their updated stability programmes
2008-01-10;2008;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.8855621814727783;on this basis after a reduction in the euro area aggregate deficit ratio in 2007 an increase in the ratio is projected for 2008 despite many countries not having achieved sound fiscal positions
2008-01-10;2008;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9737004041671753;there is a clear risk that some countries will fail to comply with the provisions of the preventive arm of the stability and growth pact thereby undermining the credibility of the pact
2008-01-10;2008;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9795867800712585;in 2008 some countries with fiscal imbalances will consolidate by less than the required minimum of 05 of gdp in structural terms
2008-01-10;2008;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.7618182301521301;in these countries much more ambitious policies will be necessary to ensure that they achieve their mediumterm objectives by 2010 at the latest in accordance with their commitment of april 2007 with regard to structural reforms the new threeyear cycle of the lisbon strategy for growth and jobs has started
2008-01-10;2008;January;REPORT;Positive;0.980521559715271;while the achievements made over the last three years of the relaunched strategy are encouraging it is important that governments step up their reform efforts to deliver enhanced knowledge and innovation competitiveness and labour market flexibility
2008-01-10;2008;January;REPORT;Positive;0.8928657174110413;such reforms are crucial to raising productivity and fostering employment opportunities in the euro area
