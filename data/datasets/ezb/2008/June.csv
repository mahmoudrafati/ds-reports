2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.8586627840995789;let me also extend these thanks to you who play such an important role in transmitting our decisions and explanations to the financial markets and to the public at large
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9616497159004211;we will now report on the outcome of todays meeting of the governing council which was also attended by the president of the eurogroup prime minister juncker
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9924543499946594;on the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses we decided at todays meeting to leave the key ecb interest rates unchanged
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9847484230995178;at the same time we noted that risks to price stability over the medium term have increased further
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Positive;0.98917156457901;inflation rates have risen significantly since the autumn of last year owing mainly to strong increases in energy and food prices
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9668203592300415;hicp inflation is now expected to remain high for a more protracted period than previously thought
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Positive;0.5416945219039917;upside risks to price stability over the medium term are also confirmed by the continuing very vigorous money and credit growth and the absence of significant constraints on bank loan supply up to now
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Positive;0.6625156998634338;at the same time the economic fundamentals of the euro area are sound
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9382619857788086;against this background we emphasise that maintaining price stability in the medium term is our primary objective in accordance with our mandate
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9725216627120972;the governing council is monitoring very closely all developments
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.884017288684845;it is in a state of heightened alertness
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9655156135559082;by acting in a firm and timely manner we will prevent secondround effects and ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9841728210449219;it is our strong determination to secure a firm anchoring of medium and longterm inflation expectations in line with price stability
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9419136047363281;allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail starting with the economic analysis
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9862832427024841;at a quarteronquarter rate of 08 real gdp growth in the first quarter of 2008 was well above expectations
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9880720376968384;in part this strength reflected temporary factors notably the unusually mild winter in many parts of europe which appears to have boosted construction activity
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Negative;0.7776281833648682;however the high growth rate in the first quarter might be partly offset in the second
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9598274827003479;it is therefore more appropriate in order to avoid being misguided by highly volatile quarterly results to evaluate the first two quarters of 2008 together
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9918197393417358;in line with available forecasts both domestic and foreign demand are expected to support ongoing real gdp growth in the euro area in 2008 albeit to a lesser extent than during 2007 while moderating growth in the world economy is expected to remain resilient benefiting in particular from continued robust growth in emerging economies
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Positive;0.972426176071167;this should support euro area external demand
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Positive;0.8578078746795654;the fundamentals of the euro area economy remain sound and the euro area does not suffer from major imbalances
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9916152358055115;against this background we expect investment growth in the euro area to provide ongoing support to economic activity as capacity utilisation remains solid and profitability in the nonfinancial corporate sector has been sustained
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9921644926071167;moreover employment and labour force participation have increased significantly and unemployment rates have fallen to levels not seen for 25 years
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9604766368865967;these developments support disposable income although purchasing power is being dampened by the impact of higher energy and food prices
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9694682359695435;this outlook is also reflected in the june 2008 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Positive;0.983178436756134;the projections foresee average annual real gdp growth in a range between 15 and 21 in 2008 and between 10 and 20 in 2009 in comparison with the march ecb staff projections the current range projected for real gdp growth in 2008 is within the upper part of the range published in march 2008 mainly as a consequence of the better than expected outcome in the first quarter
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9570285677909851;for 2009 the range has been adjusted downwards following the increase in commodity prices over recent months
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Negative;0.8668306469917297;the yearonyear growth rates which i have just mentioned need to be interpreted with particular caution on this occasion
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9647877812385559;while the annual rates suggest that growth may be weaker in 2009 than in 2008 they mask the fact that on a quarterly basis real gdp growth is projected to reach a trough in 2008 before gradually recovering thereafter
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9528933763504028;in order not to draw the wrong conclusions about the growth dynamics implied in the staff projections it is important to keep this distinction in mind
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9920294284820557;in the governing councils view the uncertainty surrounding this outlook for economic growth remains high and downside risks prevail
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9890030026435852;in particular risks continue to relate to the potential for the financial market turbulence to have a more negative impact on the real economy than anticipated
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9898968935012817;moreover downside risks stem from the dampening impact on consumption and investment of further unanticipated increases in energy and food prices
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9852380156517029;risks also arise from concerns about the emergence of protectionist pressures and the possibility of disorderly developments owing to global imbalances
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9831422567367554;with regard to price developments annual hicp inflation has remained above 3 for the past seven months
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9516584873199463;according to eurostats flash estimate it was 36 in may 2008 this confirms the more persistent current upward pressures on euro area inflation resulting largely from sharp increases in energy and food prices at the global level in recent months
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9777162671089172;looking ahead on the basis of current futures prices for these commodities the annual hicp inflation rate is likely to remain above 3 for some time to come before moderating only gradually in 2009 we are thus currently experiencing a protracted period of high annual rates of inflation which is likely to be more persistent than previously anticipated
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.7233043313026428;consistent with this view the eurosystem staff projections foresee average annual hicp inflation at between 32 and 36 in 2008 and between 18 and 30 in 2009 compared with the march 2008 ecb staff projections the ranges projected for inflation in 2008 and 2009 are markedly higher reflecting mainly higher oil and food prices and increasingly inflationary pressures in the services sector
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9630569219589233;in this context it is important to recall the conditional nature of the eurosystem staff projections
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9807093143463135;they are based on a number of assumptions which are of a purely technical nature and unrelated to policy intentions
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9868817329406738;in particular the technical assumptions for shortterm interest rates are taken from market expectations as at midmay
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9366387724876404;moreover it should be noted that the projections are based on the assumption that the recent dynamism in oil and nonoil commodity prices will diminish over the projection horizon in line with futures prices
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.92379230260849;a further crucial assumption is that there will be no broadbased secondround effects on wages
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9251678586006165;in the governing councils view at the policyrelevant mediumterm horizon risks to the outlook for prices remain clearly on the upside and have increased further these risks include notably the possibility of further increases in energy and food prices as well as of increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those foreseen thus far
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9928861260414124;it is also a strong concern that price and wagesetting behaviour could add to inflationary pressures
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Positive;0.988982617855072;the pricing power of firms particularly in market segments with low competition such as parts of the services sector may prove stronger than currently expected
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9342670440673828;moreover higher than expected wage growth may emerge taking into account high capacity utilisation tight labour market conditions and the risk of secondround effects
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9871014356613159;the governing council is monitoring wage negotiations and pricesetting behaviour in the euro area with particular attention
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Positive;0.6709548830986023;against this background it is imperative to secure that medium to longerterm inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with price stability
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9797617197036743;all parties concerned in both the private and the public sector must meet their responsibilities
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9123567938804626;wagesetting needs to take into account productivity developments the still high level of unemployment in many economies and price competitiveness positions
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Negative;0.89564049243927;moderate labour cost increases are particularly necessary in countries which have lost price competitiveness in recent years
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9794257283210754;broadly based secondround effects stemming from the impact of higher energy and food prices on price and wagesetting behaviour must be avoided
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9647464156150818;in this context the governing council is concerned about the existence of schemes in which nominal wages are indexed to consumer prices
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Negative;0.981823742389679;such schemes involve the risk of upward shocks in inflation leading to a wageprice spiral which would be detrimental to employment and competitiveness in the countries concerned
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9818967580795288;the governing council therefore calls for such schemes to be avoided
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.946990430355072;the monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longerterm horizons
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9916706085205078;annual m3 growth remained very vigorous in april supported by the continued strong growth of mfi loans to the private sector
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9895321130752563;while the impact of the flat yield curve and other temporary factors suggest that annual m3 growth continues to overstate the underlying pace of monetary expansion nonetheless even after taking such effects into account a broadbased assessment of the latest data confirms that the underlying rate of money and credit growth remains strong
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Negative;0.49884241819381714;annual m1 growth has continued to moderate in recent months reflecting higher shortterm interest rates which have encouraged further shifts from overnight into time deposits
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9934040904045105;the moderation in the growth of household borrowing also reflects the dampening impact of higher shortterm interest rates as well as cooling housing markets in several parts of the euro area
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9887109398841858;however the growth of loans to nonfinancial corporations has remained very robust
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9888851642608643;while some moderation can be expected in the future in the light of tightening financing conditions and slower economic growth bank borrowing by euro area nonfinancial corporations grew at an annual rate of 149 in april 2008 and the flow of loans in recent months has been strong
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9234486222267151;the monetary analysis has helped to support the necessary mediumterm orientation of monetary policy in the face of the ongoing financial turmoil
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.4697451889514923;from this perspective the monetary analysis points to upside risks to price stability at longer horizons
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9565774202346802;moreover a thorough assessment of the monetary counterparts suggests that as yet the availability of bank credit to households and nonfinancial corporations has not been significantly affected by the turmoil
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Negative;0.6343005299568176;to sum up a crosscheck of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis clearly confirms the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium term in a context of very vigorous money and credit growth and the absence of significant constraints on bank loan supply up to now
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9872264266014099;in fact we noted that risks to price stability over the medium term have increased further
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9879712462425232;the economic fundamentals of the euro area are sound and incoming macroeconomic data continue to point to moderate but ongoing real gdp growth
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9653428196907043;against this background the governing council is monitoring very closely all developments
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.884017288684845;it is in a state of heightened alertness
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9655156135559082;by acting in a firm and timely manner we will prevent secondround effects and ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9025276303291321;securing a firm anchoring of medium and longterm inflation expectations in line with price stability is of the essence
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Positive;0.8267308473587036;regarding fiscal policy the governing council welcomes the spring 2008 orientations for euro area fiscal policies agreed by the eurogroup ministers on 13 may 2008 many euro area governments still need to implement much more ambitious policies to ensure that their countryspecific mediumterm budgetary objectives are attained by 2010 at the latest as agreed in berlin in april 2007 achieving and maintaining sound structural fiscal positions is imperative to create scope for the free working of automatic stabilisers in all euro area countries and will help to prepare for the budgetary costs of population ageing
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9827636480331421;the steady pursuit of prudent and efficient fiscal policies would also help to limit current inflationary pressures and would increase potential growth and employment
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.7964490056037903;as regards structural reforms the governing council reiterates its full support for all efforts to enhance competition increase productivity and foster market flexibility
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Positive;0.989029049873352;against the background of a marked increase in international food commodity prices removing impediments to competition at the various stages of the food supply chain in the retail and distribution sectors would benefit european consumers through lower prices
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9728496074676514;the ongoing health check of the eu common agricultural policy is welcomed as are the efforts to limit upward pressure on agricultural prices through biofuels policies
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9897075891494751;a successful conclusion of the doha round of world trade negotiations should also help to improve the functioning of global trade in general and of agricultural markets in europe and worldwide in particular
2008-06-05;2008;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.5416623950004578;tax policies are not an appropriate means to counter commodity price increases be it oil or nonoil commodities as this would send wrong signals to producers and consumers alike and would distort markets
