2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.953532338142395;let me report on the outcome of our meeting which was also attended by the president of the eurogroup prime minister juncker and commissioner almunia
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.987277090549469;on the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses we decided at todays meeting to increase the key ecb interest rates by 25 basis points
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9302395582199097;this decision was taken to prevent broadly based secondround effects and to counteract the increasing upside risks to price stability over the medium term
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.6169957518577576;hicp inflation rates have continued to rise significantly since the autumn of last year
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9774657487869263;they are expected to remain well above the level consistent with price stability for a more protracted period than previously thought
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9401504397392273;moreover continued very vigorous money and credit growth and the absence thus far of significant constraints on bank loan supply in a context of ongoing financial market tensions confirm our assessment of upside risks to price stability over the medium term
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9392029047012329;at the same time while the latest data confirm the expected weakening of real gdp growth in mid2008 after exceptionally strong growth in the first quarter the economic fundamentals of the euro area are sound
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9724871516227722;against this background and in full accordance with our mandate we emphasise that maintaining price stability in the medium term is our primary objective and that it is our strong determination to keep medium and longterm inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with price stability
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9786810278892517;this will preserve purchasing power in the medium term and continue to support sustainable growth and employment in the euro area
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Positive;0.8647724986076355;on the basis of our current assessment the monetary policy stance following todays decision will contribute to achieving our objective
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9653433561325073;we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9419136047363281;allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail starting with the economic analysis
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Negative;0.5399048328399658;information that has become available since the june press conference confirms our previous expectation of rather weak real gdp growth in the second quarter of 2008 in part as a technical counterreaction to the strong quarteronquarter increase of 08 in the first quarter
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9885136485099792;as we have stressed previously the quarterly growth rates for the first half of this year have been subject to strong temporary and compensatory factors notably weatherrelated effects on the profile of construction activity
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9779796600341797;therefore in order to assess the underlying momentum of euro area economic activity and to avoid being misguided by highly volatile quarterly outturns it is necessary to evaluate the first two quarters of 2008 together
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9484065175056458;interpreted on this basis the information available remains broadly in line with our expectation of moderate ongoing growth
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Positive;0.992034375667572;looking ahead both domestic and foreign demand are expected to support real gdp growth in the euro area in 2008 albeit to a lesser extent than during 2007 while moderating growth in the world economy is expected to remain resilient benefiting in particular from continued robust growth in emerging economies
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Positive;0.972426176071167;this should support euro area external demand
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Positive;0.8287043571472168;as regards domestic developments the fundamentals of the euro area economy remain sound and the euro area does not suffer from major imbalances
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9896225929260254;in this context investment growth in the euro area should continue to support economic activity as rates of capacity utilisation remain elevated and profitability in the nonfinancial corporate sector has been sustained
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9925476908683777;moreover employment rates and labour force participation have increased significantly in recent years and unemployment rates have fallen to levels not seen for 25 years
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9893816709518433;however these developments which support household disposable income and consumption are unlikely to fully compensate the loss of purchasing power caused by higher energy and food prices
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9926211833953857;in the view of the governing council the uncertainty surrounding this outlook for economic activity remains high owing not least to the very high levels of commodity prices and downside risks prevail
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9860897064208984;in particular risks stem from the dampening impact on consumption and investment of further unanticipated increases in energy and food prices
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9851289987564087;moreover downside risks continue to relate to the potential for the ongoing financial market tensions to affect the real economy more adversely than anticipated
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9908791184425354;concerns about the emergence of protectionist pressures and the possibility of disorderly developments owing to global imbalances also imply downside risks to the outlook for economic activity
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Positive;0.7246717810630798;with regard to price developments annual hicp inflation has remained well above the level consistent with price stability since last autumn reaching 37 in may 2008 and  according to eurostats flash estimate  40 in june
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Negative;0.8789483904838562;this worrying level of inflation rates results largely from sharp increases in energy and food prices at the global level in recent months
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Negative;0.8505071401596069;looking ahead on the basis of current futures prices for these commodities the annual hicp inflation rate is likely to remain well above 2 for quite some time moderating only gradually in 2009 we are thus currently experiencing a protracted period of high annual rates of inflation which is likely to be more persistent than anticipated some months ago
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Negative;0.7419173717498779;risks to price stability at the policyrelevant mediumterm horizon remain clearly on the upside and have increased further over the past few months
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9569891691207886;these risks include notably the possibility of further increases in energy and food prices
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9926949739456177;there is also a very strong concern that price and wagesetting behaviour could add to inflationary pressures via broadly based secondround effects
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9864237904548645;the governing council is monitoring pricesetting behaviour and wage negotiations in the euro area with particular attention
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Positive;0.581712543964386;furthermore there are potential upside risks from unanticipated rises in indirect taxes and administered prices
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.5529949069023132;against this background it is imperative to ensure that medium to longerterm inflation expectations remain firmly anchored at levels in line with price stability
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9862573742866516;the shift in relative prices and the related transfer of income from commodityimporting countries to commodityexporting countries have to be accepted
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9690473675727844;they require a change in the behaviour of companies and households
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9801902174949646;therefore broadly based secondround effects stemming from the impact of higher energy and food prices on price and wagesetting behaviour must be avoided
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9798064231872559;all parties concerned in both the private and the public sector must meet their responsibilities in this regard
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9647464156150818;in this context the governing council is concerned about the existence of schemes in which nominal wages are indexed to consumer prices
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Negative;0.981823742389679;such schemes involve the risk of upward shocks in inflation leading to a wageprice spiral which would be detrimental to employment and competitiveness in the countries concerned
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9818967580795288;the governing council therefore calls for such schemes to be avoided
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.946990430355072;the monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longerterm horizons
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9246722459793091;in line with our monetary policy strategy we take the view that the sustained underlying strength of monetary and credit expansion in the euro area over the past few years has created upside risks to price stability
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Negative;0.6158646941184998;over recent quarters these risks appear to have become manifest as inflation has trended upwards
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9132795929908752;against this background the continued strength of monetary dynamics represents an important signal of the risks to price stability over the medium term that we have been addressing through our actions since end2005 including todays move
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9914836287498474;more specifically annual m3 growth has remained very vigorous in recent months supported by the continued strong growth of mfi loans to the private sector
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9907699227333069;although annual m3 growth of still above 10 overstates the underlying pace of monetary expansion owing to the impact of the flat yield curve and other temporary factors nonetheless even after taking such effects into account a broadbased assessment of the latest data confirms that the underlying rate of money and credit growth remains strong
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Negative;0.992448091506958;the current structure of yields has triggered substitution both within and into the broad monetary aggregate m3 leading to a pronounced decline in annual m1 growth and very rapid increases in time deposits
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Negative;0.903761625289917;at the same time higher shortterm interest rates have served to moderate the growth of household borrowing although cooling housing markets in several parts of the euro area have also played a substantial role in this regard
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9868229627609253;however the growth of bank loans to nonfinancial corporations has remained very robust despite the rises in shortterm rates
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9892177581787109;while some moderation can be expected in the future in the light of tightening financing conditions and more moderate economic growth bank borrowing by euro area nonfinancial corporations grew at an annual rate of 142 in may 2008 and the flow of loans in recent months has been strong
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9425725340843201;not least in the face of the ongoing tensions in financial markets the monetary analysis helps to support the necessary mediumterm orientation of monetary policy by focusing attention on the upside risks to price stability prevailing at medium to longer horizons
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.812454879283905;moreover a thorough assessment of the money and credit data has provided an important insight into bank behaviour and financing conditions
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.645290195941925;in particular the strength maturity and sectoral composition of bank borrowing suggest that at the level of the euro area as a whole the availability of bank credit has as yet not been significantly affected by the tensions
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Positive;0.8202753067016602;to sum up a crosscheck of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis clearly confirms the assessment of increasing upside risks to price stability over the medium term in a context of very vigorous money and credit growth and the absence thus far of significant constraints on bank loan supply
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9881777167320251;at the same time the economic fundamentals of the euro area are sound and incoming macroeconomic data continue to point to moderate ongoing real gdp growth when the high volatility of growth rates in the first half of this year is taken properly into account
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Positive;0.6234515905380249;against this background and in full accordance with our mandate it is imperative that we prevent broadly based secondround effects and counteract the increasing risks to price stability
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9864633083343506;we emphasise that maintaining price stability in the medium term is our primary objective and that it is our strong determination to keep medium and longterm inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with price stability thereby preserving purchasing power in the medium term and supporting sustainable growth and employment in the euro area
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Positive;0.8647724986076355;on the basis of our current assessment the monetary policy stance following todays decision will contribute to achieving our objective
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9653433561325073;we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Negative;0.8969293236732483;regarding fiscal policy budgetary consolidation targets are at risk in a number of euro area countries
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Negative;0.981098473072052;moreover the risk of countries budget deficits coming close to or even exceeding the 3 of gdp reference value has increased
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9035596251487732;the governing council therefore reiterates its strong support for a rigorous implementation of euro area governments 2008 budgets and a prudent design of fiscal policy plans for 2009 in line with the agreement in the eurogroup in may 2008 achieving and maintaining sound structural fiscal positions is essential to ensure the sustainability of public finances as well as to create scope for the free working of automatic stabilisers in all euro area countries and thereby contribute to the smoothing of cyclical fluctuations
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.6003285646438599;as regards structural reforms we reiterate our full support for all efforts to enhance competition increase productivity and foster market flexibility
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9904652833938599;in view of the marked increase in international food commodity prices removing impediments to competition at the various stages of the food supply chain in the retail and distribution sectors would benefit european consumers through lower prices
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9685184955596924;as regards labour markets let me direct your attention to the ecbs 2008 structural issues report which was recently submitted to the european parliament
2008-07-03;2008;July;REPORT;Positive;0.7665531635284424;it emphasises the generally favourable labour market developments in the euro area over the last decade but equally points out the urgent need to counter the ageingrelated reduction in the labour force in particular by increasing employment in all groups of society by making labour markets more flexible and by enhancing investment in education and training
