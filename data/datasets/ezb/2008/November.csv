2008-11-06;2008;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9851163029670715;the governing council will continue to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with its mediumterm objective
2008-11-06;2008;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9819112420082092;in so doing it supports sustainable growth and employment and contributes to financial stability
2008-11-06;2008;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9682788252830505;accordingly we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead
2008-11-06;2008;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9419136047363281;allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail starting with the economic analysis
2008-11-06;2008;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9918054342269897;when analysing current developments in economic activity we face an extraordinarily high degree of uncertainty in large part stemming from the intensification and broadening of the financial market turmoil
2008-11-06;2008;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9891040325164795;the world economy as a whole is feeling the adverse effects as tensions increasingly spill over from the financial sector to the real economy and from advanced economies to emerging market economies
2008-11-06;2008;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9951674938201904;in the case of the euro area the latest survey data confirm that momentum in economic activity has weakened significantly with sluggish domestic and external demand and tighter financing conditions
2008-11-06;2008;November;REPORT;Positive;0.663205623626709;looking forward it will be crucial to lay sound foundations for a recovery
2008-11-06;2008;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8986819386482239;for this to materialise as early as possible it is of the utmost importance to maintain discipline and a mediumterm perspective in macroeconomic policymaking and to avoid secondround effects
2008-11-06;2008;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.772106409072876;it is equally important that the banking sector takes fully into account the significant support measures adopted by governments to deal with the financial turmoil
2008-11-06;2008;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.7203542590141296;these measures should be supporting trust in the financial system and should help to prevent undue constraints in credit supply to companies and households
2008-11-06;2008;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9864605665206909;in combination with the recent broadbased falls in commodity prices these measures should help to restore confidence
2008-11-06;2008;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9777471423149109;in the view of the governing council a number of the downside risks to economic activity identified earlier have materialised particularly those stemming from the financial market tensions
2008-11-06;2008;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9799341559410095;other downside risks continue to relate to disorderly developments due to global imbalances and rising protectionist pressures as well as to the possibility of renewed increases in commodity prices
2008-11-06;2008;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9478661417961121;with regard to price developments annual hicp inflation has remained considerably above the level consistent with price stability since last autumn
2008-11-06;2008;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9684922099113464;however it has been steadily declining since july falling  according to eurostats flash estimate  to 32 in october from 36 in september and 38 in august
2008-11-06;2008;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8213760256767273;the continued high level of inflation is largely due to both the direct and indirect effects of past surges in energy and food prices at the global level
2008-11-06;2008;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9244424700737;moreover strong wage growth in the first half of the year in spite of a weaker growth momentum combined with a deceleration in labour productivity during the same period resulted in a significant increase in unit labour cost
2008-11-06;2008;November;REPORT;Negative;0.48618292808532715;looking forward recent sharp falls in commodity prices as well as the ongoing weakening in demand suggest that the annual hicp inflation rate will continue to decline in the coming months and reach a level in line with price stability during the course of 2009 depending in particular on the future path of oil and other commodity prices some even stronger downside movements in hicp inflation cannot be excluded around the middle of next year particularly due to base effects
2008-11-06;2008;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9916024804115295;these movements would be shortlived and therefore not relevant from a monetary policy perspective
2008-11-06;2008;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9364968538284302;looking through such volatility however upside risks to price stability at the policyrelevant horizon are alleviating
2008-11-06;2008;November;REPORT;Negative;0.6394619941711426;the remaining upside risks relate to an unexpected increase in commodity prices as well as in indirect taxes and administered prices and the emergence of broadbased secondround effects in price and wagesetting behaviour particularly in economies where nominal wages are indexed to consumer prices
2008-11-06;2008;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9749032855033875;the governing council calls for these schemes to be abolished
2008-11-06;2008;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8325567841529846;it is imperative to ensure that medium to longerterm inflation expectations remain firmly anchored at levels in line with price stability
2008-11-06;2008;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9652343988418579;turning to the monetary analysis the annual growth rates of broad money and credit aggregates while still remaining strong continued to decline in september
2008-11-06;2008;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9267800450325012;taking the appropriate mediumterm perspective monetary data up to september confirm that upside risks to price stability are diminishing but that they have not disappeared completely
2008-11-06;2008;November;REPORT;Positive;0.872641384601593;a closer examination of the money and credit data indicates that the recent intensification of financial tensions has already had an identifiable impact particularly in the form of outflows from money market funds and greater inflows into overnight deposits
2008-11-06;2008;November;REPORT;Negative;0.49629873037338257;however the full impact of investors uncertainty on their portfolio allocation behaviour is still to be seen in the coming months
2008-11-06;2008;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9871755242347717;both portfolio shifts between nonmonetary and monetary assets and shifts between different types of monetary assets can therefore not be ruled out in the period ahead
2008-11-06;2008;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.985564112663269;hence such effects will need to be taken into account when assessing monetary growth and its implications for price stability over the medium term
2008-11-06;2008;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9752709865570068;there is also some evidence in the september data that the recent intensification of the financial tensions has triggered a slower provision of bank credit to euro area residents mostly taking the form of smaller holdings of securities
2008-11-06;2008;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9698804020881653;at the same time for the euro area as a whole up to september there were no indications of a dryingup in the availability of bank loans to households and nonfinancial corporations
2008-11-06;2008;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9775114059448242;in particular the maturity composition of loans suggests that nonfinancial corporations continued to obtain funding also at relatively long maturities
2008-11-06;2008;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9551803469657898;however more data and further analysis are necessary to form a robust judgement
2008-11-06;2008;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9931232333183289;to sum up the intensification and broadening of the financial market turmoil is likely to dampen global and euro area demand for a rather protracted period of time
2008-11-06;2008;November;REPORT;Negative;0.7500454187393188;in such an environment taking into account the strong fall in commodity prices over recent months price cost and wage pressures in the euro area should also moderate
2008-11-06;2008;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9853436350822449;at the same time a crosscheck of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms that the underlying pace of monetary expansion has remained strong but has continued to show further signs of deceleration
2008-11-06;2008;November;REPORT;Negative;0.5237367749214172;hence when taking all information and analysis into account there is a further alleviation of upside risks to price stability at the policyrelevant mediumterm horizon even though they have not disappeared completely
2008-11-06;2008;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.7328357100486755;at this juncture it is therefore crucial that all parties including public authorities pricesetters and social partners fully live up to their responsibilities
2008-11-06;2008;November;REPORT;Positive;0.5740087628364563;the level of uncertainty stemming from financial market developments remains extraordinarily high and exceptional challenges lie ahead

2008-11-06;2008;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9682788252830505;accordingly we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead
2008-11-06;2008;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9613186717033386;in the area of fiscal policy mediumterm challenges such as population ageing strongly underline the need for fiscal policy to focus on mediumterm sustainability and thereby build confidence
2008-11-06;2008;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9863501191139221;accordingly and as recently confirmed by the ecofin council and the european council the fiscal policy provisions of the maastricht treaty and the stability and growth pact should continue to be applied fully
2008-11-06;2008;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9079530239105225;the fiscal rules are one of the indispensable pillars of emu and the single currency which must remain firmly in place so as not to undermine the confidence in fiscal sustainability
2008-11-06;2008;November;REPORT;Positive;0.7227599620819092;finally the current situation calls for ensuring the high quality and timeliness of statistical information on government interventions to ensure the transparent and accountable use of public funds
2008-11-06;2008;November;REPORT;Negative;0.7771078944206238;turning to structural policies the ongoing period of weak economic activity and high uncertainty about the economic outlook will require a significant degree of resilience from the euro area economy
2008-11-06;2008;November;REPORT;Positive;0.8472077250480652;the current situation should therefore be seen as a catalyst to foster the implementation of necessary domestic reforms so that countries may fully exploit the benefits offered by the enhancement of international trade and market integration in line with the principle of an open market economy with free competition
