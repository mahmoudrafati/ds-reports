2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9754957556724548;on the basis of its regular economic and monetary analyses the governing council decided to reduce the key ecb interest rates by a further 75 basis points
2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.7960849404335022;this step follows the two 50basis point reductions in the key ecb interest rates announced on 8 october and 6 november 2008 overall since our last meeting the evidence that inflationary pressures are diminishing further has increased and looking forward inflation rates are expected to be in line with price stability over the policyrelevant horizon supporting the purchasing power of incomes and savings
2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Negative;0.9941243529319763;the decline in inflation rates is due mainly to the fall in commodity prices and the significant slowdown in economic activity
2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Negative;0.9925334453582764;largely related to the effects of the intensification and broadening of the financial turmoil both global demand and euro area demand are likely to be dampened for a protracted period of time
2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Negative;0.9942418336868286;at the same time while the underlying pace of monetary expansion has remained strong it has continued to decelerate further

2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9682788252830505;accordingly we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead
2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9419136047363281;allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail starting with the economic analysis
2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Negative;0.9904250502586365;since september there has been an intensification and broadening of the financial market turmoil
2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Negative;0.9916061162948608;tensions have increasingly spilled over from the financial sector to the real economy and the world economy as a whole is feeling their adverse effects
2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Negative;0.9901706576347351;in the euro area a number of the downside risks to economic activity that were identified previously have materialised leading in the third quarter to a contraction of 02 in real gdp growth on a quarterly basis according to eurostats first estimate
2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Negative;0.9913459420204163;available survey data and the monthly indicators for october and november suggest that economic activity has weakened further during the fourth quarter of 2008 looking further ahead on the basis of our current analysis and assessment we see global economic weakness and very sluggish domestic demand persisting in the next few quarters
2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9843408465385437;according to the december 2008 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area a subsequent recovery should then gradually take place supported by the fall in commodity prices and assuming that the external environment improves and the financial tensions weaken
2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Negative;0.5465443134307861;eurosystem staff project annual real gdp growth of between 08 and 12 for 2008 between 10 and 00 for 2009 and between 05 and 15 for 2010 these figures represent substantial downward revisions relative to the previous ecb staff projections for 2008 and 2009 published in september
2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9883339405059814;forecasts by international organisations have also been revised downwards and are broadly in line with the december 2008 eurosystem staff projections
2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Negative;0.9889310002326965;in the view of the governing council the economic outlook remains surrounded by an exceptionally high degree of uncertainty
2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Negative;0.988010823726654;risks to economic growth lie on the downside
2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Negative;0.9889801740646362;they relate mainly to the potential for a more significant impact on the real economy of the turmoil in financial markets as well as concerns about protectionist pressures and possible disorderly developments owing to global imbalances
2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9031199812889099;it is crucial that all parties concerned make their contribution to lay sound foundations for a sustainable recovery
2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9485155344009399;for this to materialise as early as possible it is of the utmost importance to maintain discipline and a mediumterm perspective in macroeconomic policymaking
2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Positive;0.8191601037979126;this is the best way to support confidence
2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9466089606285095;the significant measures announced by governments to deal with the financial turmoil should be implemented swiftly so as to help ensure trust in the financial system and to prevent constraints on credit supply to companies and households
2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Negative;0.95855313539505;with regard to price developments annual hicp inflation has declined substantially since july
2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.992359459400177;according to eurostats flash estimate hicp inflation was 21 in november after 32 in october and 40 in july
2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Positive;0.8487601280212402;the significant decline in headline inflation since the summer mainly reflects the considerable easing in global commodity prices over the past few months which more than offsets the impact of the sharp rise in unit labour costs in the first half of this year
2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Negative;0.9903689026832581;looking forward lower commodity prices and weakening demand lead us to conclude that inflationary pressures are diminishing further
2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9838694930076599;the annual hicp inflation rate is expected to continue to decline in the coming months and to be in line with price stability over the policyrelevant horizon
2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9825273156166077;depending primarily on future developments in oil and other commodity prices a faster decline in hicp inflation cannot be excluded around the middle of next year mainly due to base effects
2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9737012982368469;however also due to base effects inflation rates could increase again in the second half of the year so that any sharp fall in hicp inflation should be shortlived and is therefore not relevant from a monetary policy perspective
2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9876585602760315;consistent with this assessment the december 2008 eurosystem staff projections foresee annual hicp inflation of between 32 and 34 for 2008 and declining to between 11 and 17 for 2009 for 2010 hicp inflation is projected to lie between 15 and 21
2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Negative;0.9900208711624146;the hicp inflation projections for 2008 and 2009 have been revised downwards substantially in relation to the september 2008 ecb staff projections reflecting mainly the large declines in commodity prices and the impact of weakening demand on price developments
2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9771730899810791;in this context let me remind you of the conditional nature of these projections which are based on a series of technical assumptions including market expectations for short and longterm interest rates as well as futures prices for oil and nonenergy commodities
2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9691582918167114;in addition the projections are based on the expectation of a decline in wage pressure over the projection horizon
2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9814131259918213;forecasts from international organisations give a broadly similar picture
2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.8931049704551697;looking through the shorterterm volatility in headline hicp inflation rates risks to price stability at the policyrelevant horizon are more balanced than in the past
2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Positive;0.5982586741447449;unexpected further declines in commodity prices could put downward pressure on inflation while upside risks to price stability could materialise particularly if the recent fall in commodity prices were to reverse or if domestic price pressures turn out to be stronger than assumed
2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.7403020858764648;it is therefore crucial that price and wagesetters fully live up to their responsibilities
2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Negative;0.9853901863098145;turning to the monetary analysis various estimates of underlying broad money growth point to a sustained but moderating rate of monetary expansion in the euro area
2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Positive;0.8446007966995239;monetary trends therefore support the view that inflationary pressures are diminishing further with some risks remaining on the upside in the medium to longer term
2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Negative;0.8329025506973267;it should be recognised that the intensification of the financial market turmoil since midseptember marks a potential watershed in the evolution of monetary developments
2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9506095051765442;the most recent money and credit data indicate that this intensification has had a significant impact on the behaviour of market participants
2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9854174852371216;thus far such developments have largely taken the form of substitution among components of the broad aggregate m3 rather than sharp changes in the evolution of m3 itself
2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Negative;0.9931469559669495;the latest available data namely up to the end of october reveal a continued moderation of the growth rate of loans to the nonfinancial private sector
2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9571040272712708;at the same time for the euro area as a whole there were no significant indications of a drying up in the availability of loans
2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Negative;0.9941474199295044;the annual growth rate of loans to households also moderated further in line with the weakening of economic and housing market prospects and tighter financing conditions
2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9660102725028992;the data do signal an impact of the intensification of the financial turmoil on bank behaviour
2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.8974819779396057;looking forward more data and further analysis are necessary to form a robust judgement
2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Positive;0.5993344783782959;to sum up there is increased evidence that inflationary pressures are diminishing further and inflation rates are expected to be in line with price stability over the policyrelevant horizon supporting the purchasing power of incomes and savings
2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Negative;0.9942296743392944;the decline in inflation rates is due mainly to the fall in commodity prices and the significant slowdown in economic activity largely related to the global effects of the financial turmoil
2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9775057435035706;a crosscheck of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis supports this view
2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Negative;0.9943355917930603;while the underlying pace of monetary expansion has remained strong it has continued to decelerate further
2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9824854135513306;hence when considering all available information and analysis the governing council decided to reduce the key ecb interest rates by a further 75 basis points
2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Negative;0.9789066314697266;all in all the level of uncertainty remains exceptionally high
2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9851163029670715;the governing council will continue to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with its mediumterm objective

2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9682788252830505;accordingly we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead
2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9706319570541382;regarding fiscal policies the governing council considers it crucial that discipline and a mediumterm perspective are maintained taking fully into account the consequences of any shorterterm action on fiscal sustainability
2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Positive;0.8682749271392822;it is of the utmost importance that the publics confidence in the soundness of fiscal policies is preserved with the rulesbased eu fiscal framework being fully applied and its integrity being fully preserved
2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9690334796905518;the provisions of the treaty of nice and the stability and growth pact require a mediumterm perspective and allow for the necessary flexibility
2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9680476188659668;automatic fiscal stabilisers are relatively large in the euro area and provide a powerful source of fiscal support to a weakening economy
2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9513323307037354;where room for manoeuvre exists additional budgetary measures could be effective if they are timely targeted and temporary
2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Negative;0.8984629511833191;turning to structural policies the ongoing period of weak economic activity and high uncertainty about the economic outlook imply the need to strengthen the resilience and flexibility of the euro area economy
2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9785984754562378;product market reforms should foster competition and speed up effective restructuring
2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Positive;0.7161284685134888;labour market reforms should help to facilitate appropriate wagesetting as well as labour mobility across sectors and regions
2008-12-04;2008;December;REPORT;Positive;0.8117454051971436;the current situation should therefore be seen as a catalyst to foster the implementation of necessary domestic reforms in line with the principle of an open market economy with free competition
