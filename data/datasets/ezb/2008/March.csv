2008-03-06;2008;March;REPORT;Positive;0.8389328718185425;the latest information on economic activity confirms the picture of moderating growth around the turn of the year
2008-03-06;2008;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9808593988418579;according to eurostats first estimate the quarteronquarter growth rate of euro area real gdp in the fourth quarter of 2007 was 04 following 08 in the previous quarter

2008-03-06;2008;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9892723560333252;while being dampened by the global slowdown investment growth should provide ongoing support as capacity utilisation is high and profitability has been sustained
2008-03-06;2008;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9174190163612366;at the same time as a result of the improved economic conditions and wage moderation employment and labour force participation have increased significantly and unemployment rates have fallen to levels not seen for 25 years

2008-03-06;2008;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9760931730270386;these factors are also reflected in the march 2008 ecb staff macroeconomic projections
2008-03-06;2008;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9595491290092468;annual real gdp growth is projected to lie in the range of 13 to 21 in 2008 and to be between 13 and 23 in 2009 in comparison with the december 2007 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections the ranges projected for real gdp growth in 2008 and 2009 have been revised downwards reflecting weaker global demand stronger pressure from commodity prices and less favourable financing conditions than were foreseen in december
2008-03-06;2008;March;REPORT;Positive;0.6883452534675598;available forecasts from international organisations broadly confirm this outlook
2008-03-06;2008;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9936933517456055;in the view of the governing council uncertainty about the prospects for economic growth remains unusually high
2008-03-06;2008;March;REPORT;Negative;0.989600419998169;downside risks to the outlook for economic activity continue to exist
2008-03-06;2008;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9624360203742981;they relate mainly to a potentially broader than currently expected impact of financial market developments
2008-03-06;2008;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9864333868026733;further downside risks stem from the scope for additional commodity price rises protectionist pressures and the possibility of disorderly developments owing to global imbalances
2008-03-06;2008;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9913968443870544;with regard to price developments according to eurostats first estimate the annual hicp inflation rate was 32 in february 2008 unchanged from january
2008-03-06;2008;March;REPORT;Positive;0.982344925403595;this confirms the strong upward pressure on inflation in the short term stemming mainly from the increases in energy and food prices in recent months
2008-03-06;2008;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9334059357643127;looking ahead we expect a more protracted period of relatively high rates of inflation than we did a few months ago
2008-03-06;2008;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9893747568130493;the annual hicp inflation rate will most likely remain significantly above 2 in the coming months and moderate only gradually later in the year
2008-03-06;2008;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9741967916488647;the march 2008 ecb staff macroeconomic projections foresee annual hicp inflation of between 26 and 32 in 2008 and between 15 and 27 in 2009 compared with the december 2007 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections the projected ranges for hicp inflation have shifted upwards mainly reflecting significant additional increases in food and energy prices
2008-03-06;2008;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9766724109649658;it is important to recall that these staff projections are based on a number of assumptions which are of a purely technical nature and unrelated to policy intentions
2008-03-06;2008;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9869267344474792;in particular the technical assumptions for shortterm interest rates are taken from market expectations as at midfebruary
2008-03-06;2008;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9775913953781128;moreover it should be noted that the projections are based on the assumptions that the recent dynamism in commodity prices will diminish over the projection horizon in line with futures prices and that pressure from labour costs and profit margins will be limited
2008-03-06;2008;March;REPORT;Negative;0.8237296938896179;in the view of the governing council the risks to the outlook for inflation over the medium term are on the upside
2008-03-06;2008;March;REPORT;Negative;0.6790302395820618;these risks include further rises in oil and agricultural prices continuing the strong upward trend observed in recent months
2008-03-06;2008;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9900175929069519;furthermore they include the possibility that stronger than currently expected wage growth may emerge taking into account high capacity utilisation and tight labour market conditions
2008-03-06;2008;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9891781806945801;moreover the pricing power of firms notably in market segments with low competition could be stronger than expected
2008-03-06;2008;March;REPORT;Positive;0.5458057522773743;increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those foreseen thus far also pose upside risks to the inflation outlook
2008-03-06;2008;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9663554430007935;at this juncture it is imperative that all parties concerned meet their responsibilities and that secondround effects on pricesetting on the one hand and on wages on the other hand stemming from current inflation rates be avoided
2008-03-06;2008;March;REPORT;Positive;0.8075079321861267;in the view of the governing council this is of key importance in order to preserve price stability in the medium term and thereby the purchasing power of all euro area citizens
2008-03-06;2008;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9870266318321228;the governing council is monitoring wage negotiations in the euro area with particular attention
2008-03-06;2008;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9647464156150818;in this context the governing council is concerned about the existence of schemes in which nominal wages are indexed to consumer prices
2008-03-06;2008;March;REPORT;Negative;0.981823742389679;such schemes involve the risk of upward shocks in inflation leading to a wageprice spiral which would be detrimental to employment and competitiveness in the countries concerned
2008-03-06;2008;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9818967580795288;the governing council therefore calls for such schemes to be avoided
2008-03-06;2008;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.946990430355072;the monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longerterm horizons
2008-03-06;2008;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9912480115890503;annual m3 growth remained very vigorous at 115 in january supported by the continued strong growth of mfi loans to the private sector
2008-03-06;2008;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9802435636520386;a number of temporary factors suggest that m3 growth currently overstates the pace of the underlying monetary expansion
2008-03-06;2008;March;REPORT;Positive;0.7403419613838196;the relatively flat yield curve in particular has made holding monetary assets more attractive
2008-03-06;2008;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9908053874969482;however even after taking such effects into account a broadbased assessment of the latest data confirms that the underlying rate of money and credit growth remains strong
2008-03-06;2008;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9925200939178467;the growth of household borrowing has moderated over recent months reflecting the impact of higher key ecb interest rates since december 2005 and cooling housing markets in several parts of the euro area
2008-03-06;2008;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9887109398841858;however the growth of loans to nonfinancial corporations has remained very robust

2008-03-06;2008;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9601796865463257;for the time being there is little evidence that the financial market turbulence since early august 2007 strongly influenced the overall dynamics of broad money and credit aggregates up to january 2008 in addition according to the available data the turmoil has not led to substantial portfolio shifts into monetary assets as were observed between 2001 and 2003 notwithstanding the tightening of credit standards reported in the bank lending survey for the euro area continued strong loan growth to nonfinancial corporations suggests that the supply of bank credit to firms in the euro area has not been significantly impaired by the financial turmoil thus far
2008-03-06;2008;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9762818217277527;further data and analysis will be required in order to obtain a more complete picture of the impact of the financial market developments on banks balance sheets financing conditions and money and credit growth
2008-03-06;2008;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9077505469322205;to sum up a crosscheck of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis fully confirms the assessment that there are upside risks to price stability over the medium term in a context of very vigorous money and credit growth

2008-03-06;2008;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9444772601127625;there is no justification for delaying structural fiscal consolidation in countries with remaining fiscal imbalances
2008-03-06;2008;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9729170799255371;on the contrary the challenges ahead call for particularly prudent and stabilityoriented fiscal policies to support private sector confidence

2008-03-06;2008;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9755392074584961;structural reforms would not only be beneficial for employment and potential growth but would also help to reduce inflationary pressures
2008-03-06;2008;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9614025950431824;enhancing competition especially in services and network industries is essential at this juncture to support price stability and enhance productivity growth
