2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9924543499946594;on the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses we decided at todays meeting to leave the key ecb interest rates unchanged
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9869758486747742;the latest information has confirmed the existence of strong shortterm upward pressure on inflation
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Negative;0.6607846021652222;in fact we are experiencing a rather protracted period of temporarily high annual rates of inflation resulting mainly from increases in energy and food prices
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9723329544067383;the latest information also clearly confirms our assessment of prevailing upside risks to price stability over the medium term in a context of continuing very vigorous money and credit growth

2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9546236395835876;incoming macroeconomic data continue to point to moderate but ongoing real gdp growth
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9904760122299194;however the level of uncertainty resulting from the turmoil in financial markets remains unusually high and tensions may last longer than initially expected
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9382619857788086;against this background we emphasise that maintaining price stability in the medium term is our primary objective in accordance with our mandate
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9713627696037292;the firm anchoring of medium to longerterm inflation expectations is of the highest priority to the governing council and there is certainly no room for complacency in this regard
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9783207178115845;we believe that the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving our objective
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9408170580863953;the governing council remains strongly committed to preventing secondround effects and the materialisation of upside risks to price stability over the medium term
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9681558609008789;we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the coming weeks
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9419136047363281;allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail starting with the economic analysis
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9615008234977722;according to eurostats second estimate quarteronquarter real gdp growth in the fourth quarter of 2007 was 04 following 07 in the previous quarter
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9679450988769531;the latest information on economic activity also underpins previous expectations of moderate but ongoing growth in the first quarter of 2008 overall the euro area economy has sound fundamentals and does not suffer from major imbalances
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9922651052474976;looking ahead both domestic and foreign demand are expected to support ongoing real gdp growth in the euro area in 2008 albeit to a lesser extent than during 2007 while moderating growth in the world economy is expected to remain resilient benefiting in particular from strong growth in emerging economies
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Positive;0.8670758605003357;this should continue to support euro area external demand
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9695200324058533;meanwhile investment growth in the euro area should provide ongoing support to economic activity as capacity utilisation is high profitability has been sustained and there are no significant signs of supply constraints on bank loans
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9174190163612366;at the same time as a result of the improved economic conditions and wage moderation employment and labour force participation have increased significantly and unemployment rates have fallen to levels not seen for 25 years
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9910736680030823;while being dampened by the impact of higher energy and food prices on purchasing power consumption growth should continue to contribute to economic expansion in line with real disposable income growth
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9925317168235779;the uncertainty surrounding this outlook for economic growth remains high and downside risks prevail
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9756229519844055;the risks relate mainly to the financial market turbulence which could last longer than initially thought and could have a broader than currently expected impact on the real economy
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9848797917366028;moreover downside risks also stem from the dampening impact on consumption and investment of further unanticipated increases in energy and food prices as well as from protectionist pressures and the possibility of disorderly developments owing to global imbalances
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.990720272064209;with regard to price developments according to eurostats flash estimate the annual hicp inflation rate was 35 in march 2008 after 33 in february
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9902123808860779;this outturn confirms the ongoing strong and lately further increasing shortterm upward pressure on inflation resulting largely from sharp increases in energy and food prices in recent months
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9840734601020813;looking ahead the annual hicp inflation rate is likely to remain significantly above 2 in the coming months moderating only gradually over the course of 2008 accordingly we are currently experiencing a rather protracted period of temporarily high annual rates of inflation
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Negative;0.7749699354171753;the risks to the outlook for inflation over the medium term remain clearly on the upside
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9368550777435303;these risks include the possibility of further rises in energy and food prices as well as of increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those foreseen thus far
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9819577932357788;most importantly there is a risk that price and wagesetting behaviour could add to inflationary pressures
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9913923740386963;in particular the pricing power of firms notably in market segments with low competition may prove stronger than currently expected and stronger than expected wage growth may emerge taking into account high capacity utilisation and tight labour market conditions
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.59232497215271;against this background it is imperative that all the parties concerned meet their responsibilities
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9578548073768616;secondround effects stemming from the impact of higher energy and food prices on wage and pricesetting behaviour must be avoided
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Positive;0.8075079321861267;in the view of the governing council this is of key importance in order to preserve price stability in the medium term and thereby the purchasing power of all euro area citizens
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9870266318321228;the governing council is monitoring wage negotiations in the euro area with particular attention
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9647464156150818;in this context the governing council is concerned about the existence of schemes in which nominal wages are indexed to consumer prices
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Negative;0.981823742389679;such schemes involve the risk of upward shocks in inflation leading to a wageprice spiral which would be detrimental to employment and competitiveness in the countries concerned
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9818967580795288;the governing council therefore calls for such schemes to be avoided
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.946990430355072;the monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longerterm horizons
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Positive;0.991463840007782;annual m3 growth remained very vigorous at 113 in february supported by the continued strong growth of mfi loans to the private sector
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9906691312789917;while annual m1 growth has moderated further in recent months as higher shortterm interest rates have increased the opportunity cost of holding the most liquid components of m3 the growth of time deposits remains extremely strong
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8671936392784119;this reflects the relatively flat yield curve which has made it more attractive to hold monetary assets remunerated at close to market rates than to hold riskier longermaturity instruments
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9017013311386108;overall the impact of the flat yield curve and a number of other temporary factors suggest that annual m3 growth currently overstates the pace of the underlying monetary expansion
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9908053874969482;however even after taking such effects into account a broadbased assessment of the latest data confirms that the underlying rate of money and credit growth remains strong
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9925200939178467;the growth of household borrowing has moderated over recent months reflecting the impact of higher key ecb interest rates since december 2005 and cooling housing markets in several parts of the euro area
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9887109398841858;however the growth of loans to nonfinancial corporations has remained very robust
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.6006008982658386;bank borrowing by euro area nonfinancial corporations grew at an annual rate of 148 in the year to february 2008 overall bank loans to the domestic private sector have grown at around 11 on an annual basis for the past two years
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9096492528915405;for the time being there is little evidence that the financial market turbulence seen since early august 2007 has strongly influenced the overall dynamics of broad money and credit aggregates
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Positive;0.8586471080780029;notwithstanding the tightening of credit standards reported in the bank lending survey for the euro area continued strong loan growth to nonfinancial corporations suggests that the supply of bank credit to firms in the euro area has not been significantly impaired by the financial turmoil thus far
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9762818217277527;further data and analysis will be required in order to obtain a more complete picture of the impact of the financial market developments on banks balance sheets financing conditions and money and credit growth
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Positive;0.8097688555717468;to sum up a crosscheck of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis clearly confirms the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium term in a context of very vigorous money and credit growth and with no significant signs of supply constraints on bank loans to households and nonfinancial corporations
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9667770862579346;the economic fundamentals of the euro area are sound
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9546236395835876;incoming macroeconomic data continue to point to moderate but ongoing real gdp growth
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9904760122299194;however the level of uncertainty resulting from the turmoil in financial markets remains unusually high and tensions may last longer than initially expected
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Positive;0.6507596969604492;against this background we emphasise that the firm anchoring of medium to longerterm inflation expectations is of the highest priority to the governing council
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9611840844154358;we believe that the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving this objective
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9408170580863953;the governing council remains strongly committed to preventing secondround effects and the materialisation of upside risks to price stability over the medium term
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9681558609008789;we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the coming weeks
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9934993982315063;regarding fiscal policies the intentions reflected in the latest round of stability programmes imply a rise in the euro area general government deficit ratio in 2008 further fiscal pressures are likely to arise as overly optimistic macroeconomic assumptions are already being revised downwards and political demands for fiscal loosening are increasing
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.6792027354240417;in this situation countries with fiscal imbalances are urged to make further progress with structural consolidation in line with the requirements of the stability and growth pact
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Negative;0.7679535746574402;at the current juncture particularly prudent and stabilityoriented fiscal policies would also contribute to containing inflationary pressures
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Positive;0.6222931146621704;turning to structural reforms we welcome the launch of the 200810 cycle of the renewed lisbon strategy for growth and jobs by the european council
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Negative;0.8365169763565063;the favourable labour market trends in the euro area suggest that economic reforms are paying off
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9940236210823059;however many challenges remain as overall employment is still below the lisbon target of 70 and unemployment is still unacceptably high
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9939762353897095;moreover productivity growth remains weak constraining general income growth
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9390698671340942;therefore we strongly encourage euro area countries to increase reform efforts in particular to foster market integration and to reduce rigidities in product and labour markets that restrict competition employment flexibility and wage differentiation and we support them in these efforts
2008-04-10;2008;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9763309359550476;they would not only promote employment and support potential growth but would also contribute to moderating price pressures
