2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9459799528121948;let me report on the outcome of our meeting which was also attended by commissioner almunia
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9924543499946594;on the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses we decided at todays meeting to leave the key ecb interest rates unchanged
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9217588305473328;inflation rates have risen significantly since the autumn owing mainly to increases in energy and food prices
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9775254130363464;as we have said on previous occasions inflation rates are expected to remain high for a rather protracted period of time before gradually declining again
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9450945258140564;the latest information confirms our assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium term in a context of continuing very vigorous money and credit growth
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Positive;0.988405704498291;at the same time the economic fundamentals of the euro area are sound and incoming macroeconomic data continue to point to moderate but ongoing real gdp growth
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9923056960105896;however the level of uncertainty resulting from the turmoil in financial markets remains unusually high and tensions still persist
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9382619857788086;against this background we emphasise that maintaining price stability in the medium term is our primary objective in accordance with our mandate
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Positive;0.7224783301353455;the firm anchoring of medium to longerterm inflation expectations is of the highest priority
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9408170580863953;the governing council remains strongly committed to preventing secondround effects and the materialisation of upside risks to price stability over the medium term
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9783207178115845;we believe that the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving our objective
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9681558609008789;we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the coming weeks
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9419136047363281;allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail starting with the economic analysis
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9881377816200256;the latest data and survey information on economic activity confirm previous expectations of moderate but ongoing growth in the first half of 2008 in particular industrial production data for the first months of the year showed resilience while economic sentiment generally continued to soften
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Negative;0.47529909014701843;overall the euro area economy has sound fundamentals and does not suffer from major imbalances
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9921820163726807;in line with available forecasts both domestic and foreign demand are expected to support ongoing real gdp growth in the euro area in 2008 albeit to a lesser extent than during 2007 while moderating growth in the world economy is expected to remain resilient benefiting in particular from strong growth in emerging economies
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Positive;0.8670758605003357;this should continue to support euro area external demand
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9917811751365662;meanwhile investment growth in the euro area should provide ongoing support to economic activity as capacity utilisation remains solid and profitability in the nonfinancial corporate sector has been sustained
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9932591915130615;at the same time employment and labour force participation have increased significantly and unemployment rates have fallen to levels not seen for 25 years
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9884413480758667;this supports real disposable income and thus consumption growth although purchasing power is being dampened by the impact of higher energy and food prices
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9925317168235779;the uncertainty surrounding this outlook for economic growth remains high and downside risks prevail
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9857348799705505;in particular risks relate to the potential for the financial market turbulence to have a more negative impact on the real economy than previously anticipated
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9898968935012817;moreover downside risks stem from the dampening impact on consumption and investment of further unanticipated increases in energy and food prices
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9436659216880798;risks also arise from protectionist pressures and the possibility of disorderly developments owing to global imbalances
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9804583787918091;with regard to price developments annual hicp inflation has remained above 3 for the past six months
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9888428449630737;according to eurostats flash estimate it was 33 in april 2008 this outturn confirms the ongoing strong shortterm upward pressure on inflation resulting largely from sharp increases in energy and food prices at the global level in recent months
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9641130566596985;looking ahead on the basis of current futures prices for these commodities the annual hicp inflation rate is likely to remain significantly above 2 in the coming months moderating only gradually over the course of 2008 accordingly we are currently experiencing a rather protracted period of high annual rates of inflation
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.580862820148468;in order to ensure that current high inflation rates remain temporary it is imperative that they do not become entrenched in longerterm expectations or lead to broadly based secondround effects in wage and pricesetting
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Negative;0.7749699354171753;the risks to the outlook for inflation over the medium term remain clearly on the upside
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9368550777435303;these risks include the possibility of further rises in energy and food prices as well as of increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those foreseen thus far
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9819577932357788;most importantly there is a risk that price and wagesetting behaviour could add to inflationary pressures
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9892677664756775;in particular the pricing power of firms notably in market segments with low competition may prove stronger than currently expected
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9101722240447998;moreover higher than expected wage growth may emerge taking into account high capacity utilisation tight labour market conditions and the risk of secondround effects owing to the high level of current inflation rates
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.7845680713653564;against this background it is imperative that all the parties concerned in both the private and the public sector meet their responsibilities
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9123567938804626;wagesetting needs to take into account productivity developments the still high level of unemployment in many economies and price competitiveness positions
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Negative;0.89564049243927;moderate labour cost increases are particularly necessary in countries which have lost price competitiveness in recent years
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9619637727737427;secondround effects stemming from the impact of higher energy and food prices on price and wagesetting behaviour must be avoided
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9647464156150818;in this context the governing council is concerned about the existence of schemes in which nominal wages are indexed to consumer prices
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Negative;0.981823742389679;such schemes involve the risk of upward shocks in inflation leading to a wageprice spiral which would be detrimental to employment and competitiveness in the countries concerned
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9818967580795288;the governing council therefore calls for such schemes to be avoided
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9870266318321228;the governing council is monitoring wage negotiations in the euro area with particular attention
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Positive;0.70726478099823;in the view of the governing council continued responsible wage agreements are of key importance in order to preserve price stability in the medium term and thereby the purchasing power of all euro area citizens
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.946990430355072;the monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longerterm horizons
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9915436506271362;annual m3 growth remained very vigorous at 103 in march supported by the continued strong growth of mfi loans to the private sector
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Negative;0.4536855220794678;at the same time annual m1 growth continued to moderate in march reflecting higher shortterm interest rates which encouraged further shifts from overnight into time deposits
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9905093908309937;while the impact of the flat yield curve and other temporary factors suggest that annual m3 growth currently overstates the underlying pace of monetary expansion nonetheless even after taking such effects into account a broadbased assessment of the latest data confirms that the underlying rate of money and credit growth remains strong
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Negative;0.991456925868988;the growth of household borrowing has moderated over recent months reflecting the impact of higher shortterm interest rates and cooling housing markets in several parts of the euro area
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9887109398841858;however the growth of loans to nonfinancial corporations has remained very robust
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9889410138130188;while some future moderation can be expected in the light of tightening financing conditions and slower economic growth bank borrowing by euro area nonfinancial corporations grew at an annual rate of 150 in the year to march 2008 and the flow of loans in recent months has been strong
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9458729028701782;for the time being there is little evidence that the financial market turbulence seen since early august 2007 has strongly influenced the development of broad money and loans
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Positive;0.8626023530960083;continued strong loan growth to nonfinancial corporations suggests that the availability of bank credit to euro area firms has not been significantly impaired by the financial turmoil thus far
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9762818217277527;further data and analysis will be required in order to obtain a more complete picture of the impact of the financial market developments on banks balance sheets financing conditions and money and credit growth
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Positive;0.6856526732444763;to sum up a crosscheck of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis clearly confirms the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium term in a context of very vigorous money and credit growth and with no significant signs of supply constraints on bank loans
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9879712462425232;the economic fundamentals of the euro area are sound and incoming macroeconomic data continue to point to moderate but ongoing real gdp growth
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9890509843826294;however the level of uncertainty resulting from the turmoil in financial markets remains high
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Positive;0.6507596969604492;against this background we emphasise that the firm anchoring of medium to longerterm inflation expectations is of the highest priority to the governing council
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9611840844154358;we believe that the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving this objective
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9408170580863953;the governing council remains strongly committed to preventing secondround effects and the materialisation of upside risks to price stability over the medium term
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9681558609008789;we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the coming weeks
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Negative;0.993018388748169;regarding fiscal policies the latest forecast by the european commission points to a rise in the euro area general government deficit ratio in 2008 followed by a further small increase in 2009 this deterioration in part reflects a less favourable economic environment and a likely reversal of windfall revenues accrued in past years
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.5732039213180542;however it also reflects a standstill in fiscal consolidation and new deficitincreasing measures in a number of countries with fiscal imbalances including some with high deficits
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Negative;0.8042030930519104;for several countries the attainment of the countryspecific mediumterm objectives by 2010 at the latest which is the commitment made by euro area governments in berlin in april 2007 is clearly at risk
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Positive;0.7456698417663574;in these countries much more ambitious policies are imperative
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.7366347312927246;for all countries prudent fiscal policies would also help to counteract current inflationary pressures
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.7351793050765991;at the current juncture it is also important to reinforce the structural reform agenda in particular with a view to fostering market integration and to reducing rigidities in product and labour markets
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9487444758415222;policy initiatives aimed at enhancing competition in market segments with low competition such as services and energy would allow pricing behaviour to adjust and thus contribute to lower inflation pressures
2008-05-08;2008;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9720491170883179;furthermore policies to increase trend productivity growth would contribute to smaller unit labour cost increases and ultimately also to higher employment
