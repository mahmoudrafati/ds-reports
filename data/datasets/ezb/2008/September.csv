2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9578161835670471;we will now report on the outcome of todays meeting of the governing council which was also attended by commissioner almunia
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9878173470497131;on the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses at todays meeting we decided to leave the key ecb interest rates unchanged
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Positive;0.7134199142456055;the information that has become available since the last meeting has confirmed that annual inflation rates are likely to remain well above levels consistent with price stability for a protracted period of time and that upside risks to price stability over the medium term prevail
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Positive;0.9581356644630432;while the growth of broad money and credit aggregates is now showing some signs of moderation the still strong underlying pace of monetary expansion points to continued upside risks to price stability over the medium term
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9936701059341431;the latest economic data also confirm the weakening of real gdp growth in mid2008
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9935692548751831;this reflects partly an expected technical reaction to the strong growth seen in the first quarter as well as dampening effects from global and domestic factors including direct and indirect effects from high commodity prices
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.616459310054779;in this environment it remains imperative to avoid broadbased secondround effects in price and wagesetting
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.969257116317749;in full accordance with our mandate we emphasise that maintaining price stability in the medium term is our primary objective and that we are resolute in our determination to keep medium and longterm inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with price stability
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Positive;0.9643887281417847;this will preserve purchasing power in the medium term and support sustainable growth and employment
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Positive;0.9384058713912964;on the basis of our assessment the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving our objective
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9653433561325073;we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9419136047363281;allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail starting with the economic analysis
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9912511706352234;according to eurostats first estimate following strong quarterly growth of 07 in the first quarter euro area real gdp contracted by 02 in the second quarter of 2008 in terms of quarteronquarter growth private consumption declined by 02 and there was a perceptible weakness in investment which fell by 12
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9552942514419556;growth in both euro area imports and exports declined by 04
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Negative;0.994581401348114;taking into account all available information the euro area economy is currently experiencing an episode of weak activity characterised by high commodity prices weighing on consumer confidence and demand as well as by dampened investment growth
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Positive;0.8145267963409424;we expect this episode to be followed by a gradual recovery
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Positive;0.9908724427223206;in particular if persistent the fall in oil prices from their peak in july will help strengthen real disposable income with the level of employment remaining high and the unemployment rate low by historical standards
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Positive;0.9897516965866089;moreover growth in the world economy is expected to remain relatively resilient benefiting mainly from sustained growth in emerging economies
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Positive;0.6551317572593689;this should support external demand for euro area goods and services and thereby investment
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9681328535079956;this outlook is also reflected in the september 2008 ecb staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9692895412445068;the exercise projects average annual real gdp growth in a range between 11 and 17 in 2008 and between 06 and 18 in 2009 in comparison with the june eurosystem staff projections real gdp growth figures for 2008 and 2009 are lower
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9916555881500244;in the view of the governing council the uncertainty surrounding this outlook for economic activity is particularly high at the current juncture and generally downside risks prevail
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9786636829376221;risks stem particularly from renewed increases in energy and food prices which could dampen consumption and investment
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Negative;0.984454870223999;moreover downside risks continue to relate to the potential for the financial market tensions to affect the real economy more adversely than currently foreseen
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9916832447052002;the possibility of disorderly developments owing to global imbalances also implies downside risks to the outlook for economic activity as do concerns about rising protectionist pressures
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8466121554374695;with regard to price developments annual hicp inflation has remained considerably above the level consistent with price stability since last autumn standing at 38 in august according to eurostats flash estimate after 40 in june and july 2008 this worrying level of inflation is largely the result of both the direct and indirect effects of past surges in energy and food prices at the global level
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9860581755638123;moreover wage growth has been picking up in recent quarters at a time when labour productivity growth has decelerated resulting in sharp increases in unit labour costs
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Positive;0.9153482913970947;looking ahead on the basis of current commodity futures prices the annual hicp inflation rate is likely to remain well above levels consistent with price stability for quite some time moderating only gradually during the course of 2009 consistent with this view the september ecb staff projections foresee average annual hicp inflation at between 34 and 36 in 2008 and between 23 and 29 in 2009 the higher inflation projections for 2008 and 2009 mainly reflect higher energy prices and to a lesser extent higher food and services prices than assumed previously
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9752318859100342;in this context it is important to recall the conditional nature of the ecb staff projections
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9790096282958984;they are based on a number of assumptions that are of a purely technical nature and unrelated to policy intentions
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9759005904197693;in particular the technical assumptions for shortterm interest rates reflect market expectations as at midaugust
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8721491694450378;moreover it should be noted that the projections are based on the assumption that oil and nonoil commodity prices while remaining at elevated levels will exhibit greater stability over the projection horizon than has been the case in recent months in line with prevailing futures prices
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Negative;0.7958508133888245;it is the governing councils view that at the policyrelevant mediumterm horizon there are upside risks to the outlook for price developments
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Positive;0.9558887481689453;these risks include the possibility of renewed increases in commodity prices and of previous rises having further and stronger indirect effects on consumer prices
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9893448948860168;there is particularly a very strong concern that the emergence of broadbased secondround effects in price and wagesetting behaviour could add significantly to inflationary pressures
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9202204346656799;moreover the upside risks to price stability could be aggravated by unexpected rises in indirect taxes and administered prices
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.5529949069023132;against this background it is imperative to ensure that medium to longerterm inflation expectations remain firmly anchored at levels in line with price stability
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9679468870162964;broadbased secondround effects stemming from the impact of higher energy and food prices on price and wagesetting behaviour must be avoided
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9864237904548645;the governing council is monitoring pricesetting behaviour and wage negotiations in the euro area with particular attention
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9813798069953918;all parties concerned  in both the private and the public sectors  must meet their responsibilities in this regard
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9828895926475525;the governing council has repeatedly expressed its concern about the existence of schemes in which nominal wages are indexed to consumer prices
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Negative;0.981823742389679;such schemes involve the risk of upward shocks in inflation leading to a wageprice spiral which would be detrimental to employment and competitiveness in the countries concerned
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9749032855033875;the governing council calls for these schemes to be abolished
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.946990430355072;the monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longerterm horizons
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Positive;0.9246722459793091;in line with our monetary policy strategy we take the view that the sustained underlying strength of monetary and credit expansion in the euro area over the past few years has created upside risks to price stability
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Negative;0.6158646941184998;over recent quarters these risks appear to have become manifest as inflation has trended upwards
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9425725340843201;not least in the face of the ongoing tensions in financial markets the monetary analysis helps to support the necessary mediumterm orientation of monetary policy by focusing attention on the upside risks to price stability prevailing at medium to longer horizons
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Positive;0.9896352887153625;while the growth of broad money and credit aggregates is now showing some signs of moderation reflecting the policy measures taken since 2005 to address risks to price stability the strong underlying pace of monetary expansion points to continued upside risks to price stability over the medium term
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Positive;0.9753215312957764;the currently flat yield curve has given rise to a substitution from longer maturity assets into monetary instruments which offer similar remuneration but greater liquidity and less risk
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9874293208122253;this substitution has led the current headline rate of m3 growth to overstate the underlying pace of monetary expansion
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9703512787818909;at the same time shifts out of overnight deposits drove the annual growth rate of m1 down further in july
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9913204312324524;these effects as well as other temporary factors must be taken into account when assessing monetary developments and their implications
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Positive;0.9510814547538757;a broadbased analysis of the data taking the appropriate mediumterm perspective and allowing for these considerations confirms the underlying strength of money growth
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Negative;0.5589787364006042;in particular the pace maturity and sectoral composition of borrowing from banks suggest that at the level of the euro area as a whole the availability of bank credit has as yet not been significantly affected by the ongoing financial tensions
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9936093091964722;this notwithstanding growth in loans now shows signs of moderation as previously anticipated with corporate demand for credit slowing
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9940000772476196;at the same time the growth of loans to households continues to follow the downward trend observed over the past few years as a result of higher shortterm interest rates and housing market weakness in several parts of the euro area
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.7802681922912598;to sum up a crosscheck of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis clearly confirms the assessment of upside risks to price stability over the medium term
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Positive;0.5637736916542053;the information that has become available since the last meeting of the governing council has confirmed that annual inflation rates are likely to remain well above levels consistent with price stability for a protracted period of time
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Positive;0.5592024326324463;the growth of broad money and credit aggregates is now showing some signs of moderation but the still strong underlying pace of monetary expansion points to continued risks to price stability over the medium term

2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9867457747459412;regarding fiscal policy budget plans for 2009 should fully reflect existing policy commitments
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.6260731220245361;this implies that euro area countries with relatively large fiscal deficits need to specify much more ambitious and concrete consolidation measures especially on the expenditure side
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Positive;0.697033166885376;countries that have already achieved their mediumterm budgetary objectives need to ensure that they maintain sound structural fiscal positions
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Positive;0.9646982550621033;at the current juncture the steady pursuit of stabilityoriented fiscal policies would help to contain inflationary pressures and provide the required budgetary room for manoeuvre to allow automatic stabilisers to contribute to smoothing the business cycle
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Positive;0.6446129083633423;turning to structural policies measures that reduce adjustment costs and promote moderate unit labour cost growth are of the utmost importance in the current economic circumstances
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9953049421310425;while this is crucial in all euro area countries it is particularly pressing in those that have experienced a significant loss of cost and price competitiveness over recent years and where unemployment has already started to rise
2008-09-04;2008;September;REPORT;Positive;0.9730315208435059;moreover fostering productivity through enhanced investment in innovation and education enlarges the scope for increases in real incomes in the longer run
