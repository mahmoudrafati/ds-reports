2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9750279188156128;we will now report on the outcome of todays meeting of the governing council
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9924543499946594;on the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses we decided at todays meeting to leave the key ecb interest rates unchanged
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Positive;0.7418701648712158;the information that has become available since our previous meeting has further underpinned the reasoning behind our decision to increase interest rates in july
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Positive;0.9382081031799316;it has confirmed that annual inflation rates are likely to remain well above levels consistent with price stability for a protracted period of time and that risks to price stability over the medium term remain on the upside
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Positive;0.8799776434898376;this assessment is underpinned by continued vigorous money growth with so far no signs of significant constraints on bank loan supply
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.787919819355011;in such a context it remains crucial to avoid broadly based secondround effects in wage and pricesetting
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9938568472862244;the latest economic data point to a weakening of real gdp growth in mid2008 which in part was expected after the exceptionally strong growth in the first quarter
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Positive;0.9724871516227722;against this background and in full accordance with our mandate we emphasise that maintaining price stability in the medium term is our primary objective and that it is our strong determination to keep medium and longterm inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with price stability
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Positive;0.9643887281417847;this will preserve purchasing power in the medium term and support sustainable growth and employment
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Positive;0.9384058713912964;on the basis of our assessment the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving our objective
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9653433561325073;we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9419136047363281;allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail starting with the economic analysis
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9939473867416382;the information on economic activity that has become available since the july press conference suggests that real gdp growth figures for mid2008 will be substantially weaker than for the first quarter of the year
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Positive;0.98042893409729;as indicated on previous occasions this represents partly a technical reaction to the strong growth seen in the first months of the year
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9945712685585022;in addition it also partly reflects a weakening in gdp growth due to factors such as slower expansion at the global level and dampening effects from high and volatile oil and food prices
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9737318158149719;in order to assess the underlying momentum of euro area economic activity and to avoid being misguided by highly volatile quarterly outturns it is necessary to look through the volatility in quarteronquarter growth rates and monthly indicators
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Positive;0.9910197854042053;taking this perspective growth in the world economy while moderating is expected to remain relatively resilient benefiting in particular from sustained growth in emerging economies
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.5475093722343445;this should support external demand for euro area goods and services
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.6156366467475891;as regards domestic developments in a mediumterm perspective the fundamentals of the euro area are sound and the euro area does not suffer from major imbalances
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Positive;0.9395750761032104;investment growth in the euro area has provided ongoing though moderating support to economic activity
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9929901361465454;moreover employment and labour force participation have increased significantly and unemployment rates remain low in historical terms
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9893816709518433;however these developments which support household disposable income and consumption are unlikely to fully compensate the loss of purchasing power caused by higher energy and food prices
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9933186769485474;in the view of the governing council the uncertainty surrounding this outlook for economic activity remains high owing to among other things the very high and volatile levels of commodity prices and the ongoing tensions in financial markets
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Negative;0.955998957157135;overall downside risks prevail
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9860897064208984;in particular risks stem from the dampening impact on consumption and investment of further unanticipated increases in energy and food prices
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9841411113739014;moreover downside risks continue to relate to the potential for the financial market tensions to affect the real economy more adversely than currently anticipated
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9911008477210999;the possibility of disorderly developments owing to global imbalances also implies downside risks to the outlook for economic activity as do concerns about the emergence of protectionist pressures
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Negative;0.8605449795722961;in this respect the failure of the recent negotiations in the context of the world trade organizations doha round on trade liberalisation is a major setback
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9750389456748962;with regard to price developments annual hicp inflation has remained considerably above the level consistent with price stability since last autumn reaching 40 in june 2008 and according to eurostats flash estimate 41 in july
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.5867894291877747;this worrying level of inflation rates results largely from both direct and indirect effects of past sharp increases in energy and food prices at the global level
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Negative;0.7129528522491455;at the same time while labour productivity growth has decelerated there are some indications that labour cost growth has been rising in recent quarters
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Positive;0.8993545174598694;looking ahead on the basis of current futures prices for commodities the annual hicp inflation rate is likely to remain well above a level consistent with price stability for quite some time moderating only gradually in 2009 risks to price stability at the policyrelevant mediumterm horizon remain clearly on the upside and have increased over the past few months
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9456873536109924;these risks include notably the possibility of further increases in energy and food prices and of increasing indirect effects on consumer prices
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9913130402565002;there is a very strong concern that price and wagesetting behaviour could add to inflationary pressures via broadly based secondround effects
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9864237904548645;the governing council is monitoring pricesetting behaviour and wage negotiations in the euro area with particular attention
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Positive;0.581712543964386;furthermore there are potential upside risks from unanticipated rises in indirect taxes and administered prices
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.5529949069023132;against this background it is imperative to ensure that medium to longerterm inflation expectations remain firmly anchored at levels in line with price stability
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9808403849601746;the shift in relative prices and the related transfer of income from commodityimporting countries to commodityexporting countries require a change in the behaviour of companies and households
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9801902174949646;therefore broadly based secondround effects stemming from the impact of higher energy and food prices on price and wagesetting behaviour must be avoided
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9798064231872559;all parties concerned in both the private and the public sector must meet their responsibilities in this regard
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9819380044937134;in this context the governing council has repeatedly expressed its concern about the existence of schemes in which nominal wages are indexed to consumer prices
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Negative;0.981823742389679;such schemes involve the risk of upward shocks in inflation leading to a wageprice spiral which would be detrimental to employment and competitiveness in the countries concerned
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9818967580795288;the governing council therefore calls for such schemes to be avoided
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.946990430355072;the monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longerterm horizons
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Positive;0.9246722459793091;in line with our monetary policy strategy we take the view that the sustained underlying strength of monetary and credit expansion in the euro area over the past few years has created upside risks to price stability
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Negative;0.6158646941184998;over recent quarters these risks appear to have become manifest as inflation has trended upwards
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9425725340843201;not least in the face of the ongoing tensions in financial markets the monetary analysis helps to support the necessary mediumterm orientation of monetary policy by focusing attention on the upside risks to price stability prevailing at medium to longer horizons
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Positive;0.9730463027954102;while the growth of broad money and credit aggregates is now showing some signs of moderation also reflecting the policy measures taken since 2005 to address upside risks to price stability the strong underlying pace of monetary expansion points to continued risks to price stability over the medium term
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9930157661437988;the current yield curve has led to very rapid increases in time deposits and to a substantial decline in annual m1 growth
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9903876185417175;such effects and other temporary factors must be taken into account in assessing monetary developments
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Positive;0.9293349981307983;overall a broadbased analysis of the data taking the appropriate mediumterm perspective confirms the underlying strength of money growth
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Positive;0.9884436726570129;one of the main factors leading to this conclusion is the still high growth of mfi loans to the private sector which is underpinning the robust nature of monetary growth
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.6920687556266785;the pace maturity and sectoral composition of bank borrowing suggest that at the level of the euro area as a whole the availability of bank credit has as yet not been significantly affected by the ongoing financial tensions
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9936581254005432;higher shortterm interest rates and housing market weakness in several parts of the euro area have dampened the growth of household borrowing over the past few years
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Positive;0.9856489896774292;by contrast and notwithstanding tighter financing conditions and moderating economic growth the expansion of bank credit to nonfinancial corporations thus far remains very robust
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Positive;0.617770254611969;to sum up a crosscheck of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis clearly confirms the assessment of increasing upside risks to price stability over the medium term
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Positive;0.9681552052497864;annual inflation rates are likely to remain well above levels consistent with price stability and monetary aggregates continue to grow vigorously with so far no signs of significant constraints on bank loan supply
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9938568472862244;the latest economic data point to a weakening of real gdp growth in mid2008 which in part was expected after the exceptionally strong growth in the first quarter

2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9653433561325073;we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9536681175231934;regarding fiscal policy there are risks that some countries will not achieve their fiscal targets this year
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Negative;0.4587434232234955;in this situation a rigorous implementation of budget plans and the avoidance of expenditure slippage are of crucial importance
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.986793577671051;budget plans for 2009 which are currently being finalised in a number of countries need to reflect european commitments
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.944712221622467;in particular countries with still large deficits must provide ambitious and concrete deficit reduction plans backed by clearly specified measures preferably on the expenditure side
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Positive;0.9271695017814636;where budgetary scope is available automatic stabilisers can contribute to the smoothing of cyclical economic fluctuations
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9935599565505981;as regards structural policies measures which reduce adjustment costs and promote moderate unit labour cost growth are of the utmost importance particularly in the current climate of high inflation and slowing real gdp growth
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9121742248535156;these include the removal of impediments to competition in the services sector in general and at the various stages of the food supply chain in the retail and distribution sectors as well as in the energy sector more specifically
2008-08-07;2008;August;REPORT;Positive;0.9773347973823547;equally making labour markets more flexible and enhancing investment in education and training would foster productivity thereby increasing the scope for increases in real incomes
