2022-10-06;2022;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9631881713867188;initially fears of a recession had dominated global asset prices and financial conditions had eased on the expectation that the pace of interest rate increases by central banks around the world would slow down as a recession was perceived to do part of the job of bringing inflation back to the target level
2022-10-06;2022;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.7493743300437927;however more recently the focus of investors had gradually shifted back towards a tighter monetary policy stance as inflation outcomes had continued to be higher than expectedin this environment there had been four key observations

2022-10-06;2022;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8600044250488281;the heightened volatility in interest rate markets had primarily been driven by the uncertainty around the future course of inflation and the shift of monetary policy to a meetingbymeeting approach which had increased data dependencyregarding the change in policy rate expectations markets had reassessed both the extent and the pace of policy normalisation
2022-10-06;2022;October;REPORT;Positive;0.511879563331604;after reaching a trough in late july the terminal rate the level at which market participants expected the policy interest rate to peak had rebounded markedly and currently stood close to the peak seen in midjune
2022-10-06;2022;October;REPORT;Positive;0.8826658129692078;the expected speed of progress towards this terminal rate had also increased as investors expected a less gradual tightening cyclethe steeper expected policy path partly reflected the fact that investors attached an increasing probability to a scenario of inflation being higher for longer

2022-10-06;2022;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9825441241264343;yet the decline in risk asset prices had been partly offset by an improvement in investor sentiment as investors now required less compensation for holding risky assets instead of riskfree bonds

2022-10-06;2022;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9916417598724365;a key factor in this divergence had been the sharp rise in european energy prices which weighed on households real disposable income and firms earnings expectations
2022-10-06;2022;October;REPORT;Negative;0.8134980201721191;high energy prices in europe and rising downside risks to growth in the euro area relative to the united states were also weighing on the euro exchange rate as was the divergence of the expected path of the policy rate differential between the two economiesin euro area fixed income markets in tandem with the repricing of other risk assets corporate bond spreads had temporarily narrowed during the early summer in line with a recovery in investors risk appetite before reversing some of the narrowing in august

2022-10-06;2022;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9693329334259033;the september 2022 ecb staff macroeconomic projections featured a significant upward revision to inflation in the period to the third quarter of 2023 this was mostly due to higher energy and food commodity prices but core inflation also accounted for an upward revision of about 1 percentage point
2022-10-06;2022;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9846791625022888;this revision in turn was related to the assumption of a speedier passthrough of energy and food inflation to core inflation

2022-10-06;2022;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.98028564453125;that said it was important to distinguish between a recovery in demand and a situation of excess demandthis distinction also mattered for the comparison of inflation in the euro area and in the united states
2022-10-06;2022;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9058330059051514;in the united states the pickup in core inflation was closely matched by a pickup in wage growth
2022-10-06;2022;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9738436937332153;this was not the case in the euro area where there was a clear disconnect between the evolution of core inflation and that of negotiated wages

2022-10-06;2022;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9679591655731201;the large movements in euro area core inflation were instead due to other components such as manufacturing goods and other items with a relatively low share of wages in direct input costs
2022-10-06;2022;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9931569695472717;it followed that the factors behind the increase in core inflation in the two economies were different with wages playing a central role in the united states but not in the euro area

2022-10-06;2022;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9815807938575745;however for 2023 the projected inflation rate was 4 which was significantly below the 55 inflation rate included in the september staff projections

2022-10-06;2022;October;REPORT;Positive;0.960541844367981;marketbased measures of inflation compensation had increased strongly for the near term
2022-10-06;2022;October;REPORT;Negative;0.8878452777862549;this increase largely reflected expectations of higher nearterm inflation but the energy shock and the uncertainty related to the supply of russian gas had also caused inflation risk premia to increase
2022-10-06;2022;October;REPORT;Negative;0.8351795077323914;looking further ahead however inflation compensation measures embedded a very steep decline to around 2 by mid2024

2022-10-06;2022;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9250388145446777;compared with the june projections oil prices had been revised down moderately while gas and electricity prices had been revised up sharply
2022-10-06;2022;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9578506350517273;shortterm interest rates had also been revised up significantly for 2023 and 2024 with threemonth interest rates now seen as being close to 2 for 2023 and remaining around that level for 2024 so a significant tightening of financing conditions was embedded in the projections which reflected the ecbs monetary policy tightening
2022-10-06;2022;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9627125263214111;moving on to the main features of the september staff projections it was useful to look at some key figures expressed as changes in the fourth quarter relative to the previous years fourth quarter
2022-10-06;2022;October;REPORT;Positive;0.5160725712776184;this better captured the developments in the interim cleaned of carryover effects that were influencing annual averages
2022-10-06;2022;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9888620972633362;inflation was expected to average 92 in the fourth quarter of 2022 relative to the fourth quarter of 2021 inflation was then seen to fall to 33 in the fourth quarter of 2023 and to 22 in the fourth quarter of 2024 when looking at annual averages inflation was expected to be 55 next year
2022-10-06;2022;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9602399468421936;the difference with respect to the 33 expected in the fourth quarter of 2023 was due to the fact that the annual figure for 2023 embedded a large carryover effect given the high starting point of the projection
2022-10-06;2022;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9892372488975525;thus the annual figures shown in the ecb staff projections featured a significant drop in momentum when looking at the quarterly inflation developments
