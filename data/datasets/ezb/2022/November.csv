2022-11-24;2022;November;REPORT;Negative;0.79317307472229;moreover it was argued that maintaining the average tltro iii rate for the remaining lifetime of the operations at a rate below the deposit facility rate risked blurring the intended policy signal which could call into question the governing councils determination to bring inflation back to its mediumterm target of 2 in a timely manner
2022-11-24;2022;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9750490188598633;it was noted that with the adjustment of the tltro iii conditions banks would have the incentive and the opportunity for early repayment of their borrowing which would also contribute to the normalisation of the eurosystems balance sheet
2022-11-24;2022;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9675567746162415;such a decrease in the size of the balance sheet was judged to be necessary and a helpful first step before considering a reduction of the asset purchase programme app portfolio
2022-11-24;2022;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9193203449249268;finally it was noted that a repayment of tltro iii funds would reduce banks need for collateral which could flow back to the market and thereby help to alleviate the collateral scarcity that had led to repo market tensions
2022-11-24;2022;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9486932754516602;overall members agreed that the monetary policy case for adjusting the tltro iii conditions was strong and that the resulting effects could not be achieved through other measures as indicated by mr lane in his proposal
2022-11-24;2022;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9534786343574524;although side effects were acknowledged these were seen not to outweigh the benefits from the tltro iii adjustment which was required in order to maintain the effectiveness of monetary policy and thereby the governing councils ability to attain its mediumterm inflation target in a timely manner
2022-11-24;2022;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9875500798225403;in consideration of all these arguments the adjustment was therefore judged to be proportionate in the service of the governing councils mandatemembers further agreed with mr lanes proposal to lower the remuneration of the minimum reserves held by euro area credit institutions with the eurosystem from the rate on the main refinancing operations to the deposit facility rate in order to align it more closely with money market conditions
2022-11-24;2022;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9865365624427795;members also agreed with the proposal to continue applying flexibility in reinvesting redemptions falling due in the pepp portfolio
2022-11-24;2022;November;REPORT;Positive;0.8582624197006226;retaining the existing flexibility in pepp reinvestments was seen as a prudent approach to countering risks to the monetary policy transmission mechanism related to the pandemic which still persisted in the current market environment
2022-11-24;2022;November;REPORT;Positive;0.6032887697219849;looking beyond the configuration of the key ecb interest rates it was underlined that the eurosystems large bond portfolios were continuing to provide further significant monetary policy accommodation by compressing term premia
2022-11-24;2022;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9534964561462402;allowing the downward pressure on term premia to decline would facilitate more efficient setting of monetary policy thereby helping to contain inflation
2022-11-24;2022;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9920905828475952;in this respect it was seen as necessary following an assessment of the repayments resulting from the adjustment of tltro iii and their impact on financial conditions to discuss the reinvestment strategy for the app portfolio at the governing councils december monetary policy meeting
2022-11-24;2022;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9911004900932312;members widely concurred with mr lane that monetary policy should continue to be datadependent and not follow a preset path in accordance with a meetingbymeeting approach to setting interest rates
2022-11-24;2022;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9542065262794495;to stress the governing councils commitment to achieving its mediumterm inflation target it was seen as important to indicate that interest rates were expected to be raised further in order to guard against the risk of inflation expectations becoming unanchored
2022-11-24;2022;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9827037453651428;forward guidance on interest rates was widely seen as being of little value in view of the high uncertainty currently prevailing
2022-11-24;2022;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9899076223373413;in the same vein indicating the size of future interest rate adjustments was seen as implying renewed forward guidance on interest rates which the governing council had deemed no longer warranted
2022-11-24;2022;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9301697015762329;the governing council stressed the importance of authorities addressing supplyside issues with appropriate structural and macroprudential policies which would support monetary policy in ensuring price stability
2022-11-24;2022;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9742058515548706;finally it was seen as appropriate to reiterate that the governing council stood ready to adjust all of its instruments within its mandate to ensure that inflation returned to its mediumterm target of 2the members of the governing council subsequently finalised the monetary policy statement which the president and the vicepresident would as usual deliver at the press conference following the governing council meetingmonetary policy statementmonetary policy statement to the press conference of 27 october 2022press releasesmonetary policy decisionsecb recalibrates targeted lending operations to help restore price stability over the medium termecb adjusts remuneration of minimum reserves
