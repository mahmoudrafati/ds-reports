2022-01-20;2022;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9928486347198486;this risk distribution suggested investors were concerned that the high uncertainty about the inflation outlook could mean the conditions of the ecbs forward guidance might be met earlier than currently expected

2022-01-20;2022;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9117943048477173;reference was made to the disinflationary impact of omicron through lower global commodity prices
2022-01-20;2022;January;REPORT;Negative;0.8729052543640137;it was suggested that the fall in oil prices since the cutoff date for the projections would mechanically lower inflation in 2022 at the same time the point was made that the balance between the disinflationary and inflationary consequences of omicron was uncertain

2022-01-20;2022;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9803815484046936;regarding the inflation outlook members concurred that the recent and projected nearterm increase in inflation was driven largely by temporary factors that were expected to ease in the course of 2022 although the mediumterm inflation outlook had been revised up in the staff projections inflation was still projected to settle below the governing councils 2 target in the baseline scenario
2022-01-20;2022;January;REPORT;Positive;0.41837865114212036;it was stressed that the projected convergence of inflation expectations towards 2 was to be welcomed although the outlook was surrounded by exceptionally high uncertainty

2022-01-20;2022;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9915257096290588;overall members broadly agreed that progress on economic recovery and towards the governing councils 2 mediumterm inflation target permitted a gradual normalisation of the monetary policy stance

2022-01-20;2022;January;REPORT;Positive;0.7903335094451904;on the one hand it was seen as an important lesson of the pepp that such flexibility should remain an element of monetary policy whenever threats to monetary policy transmission and to the attainment of price stability became apparent
2022-01-20;2022;January;REPORT;Positive;0.8782670497894287;the flexibility embedded in the pepp was judged to have helped to provide the required monetary policy support and to reduce fragmentation in financial markets during the crisis
2022-01-20;2022;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.981741726398468;it was suggested that the governing council should therefore stress the importance of flexibility in its communication
2022-01-20;2022;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.8936291933059692;on the other hand it was argued that the pepps flexibility was targeted at the specific pandemic shock and might not be proportionate if risks to the transmission of monetary policy and market fragmentation arose in other contexts
