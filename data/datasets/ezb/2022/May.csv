2022-05-19;2022;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9508166313171387;developments in sovereign yields in the euro area since the previous monetary policy meeting highlighted three facts
2022-05-19;2022;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.8000596165657043;first the gdpweighted sovereign yield curve in the euro area had shifted upwards since the march meeting and currently stood considerably above the levels recorded prior to the war across the entire maturity spectrum
2022-05-19;2022;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.6060628294944763;second the euro area yield curve had become steeper
2022-05-19;2022;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9888398051261902;third despite the recent rise both short and longterm euro area nominal bond yields remained low from a historical perspective
2022-05-19;2022;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9154192209243774;a modelbased breakdown of the recent increase in tenyear euro area riskfree rates pointed to two main factors driving the upward shift in sovereign yields since the previous meeting
2022-05-19;2022;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9564486145973206;first the improvement in the global and euro area macroeconomic outlook and risk sentiment suggested that investors did not see the wars effect on growth as being sufficiently strong and longlasting to derail the recovery
2022-05-19;2022;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9847175478935242;the second and related factor reflected the anticipated monetary policy response
2022-05-19;2022;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9794998168945312;consistent with expectations of continued growth and the sharp repricing of the inflation outlook markets expected a faster pace of monetary policy normalisation in the euro area to bring real yields out of negative territory
2022-05-19;2022;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.5069383382797241;breaking down longterm yields into real rates and the inflation component showed that the rise in nominal longterm interest rates in the euro area since the russian invasion of ukraine mainly reflected a marked reappraisal of the inflation outlook by investors while real interest rates had fallen slightly since march despite the recent increase in nominal yields
2022-05-19;2022;May;REPORT;Negative;0.7269778847694397;the rising inflationary pressures were also evident from the inflationlinked swap forward curve which had shifted markedly higher from the already elevated levels prevailing at the time of the governing councils previous monetary policy meeting
2022-05-19;2022;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.8635788559913635;this increase in inflation compensation had stemmed from higher inflation risk premia

2022-05-19;2022;May;REPORT;Positive;0.6879288554191589;the sharp rise in inflation risk premia signalled that investors demanded higher compensation for holding inflation risks in their portfolio
2022-05-19;2022;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9910441637039185;the fiveyear forward inflationlinked swap rate five years ahead which was a marketbased measure of longerterm inflation expectations stood at around 24
2022-05-19;2022;May;REPORT;Negative;0.8995794653892517;this suggested that even over the longer term investors attached a higher probability to inflation turning out to be higher than expected rather than lower than expectedcompared with march the shift in marketbased indicators of monetary policy expectations had been substantial
2022-05-19;2022;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.8844765424728394;the overnight index swap ois forward curve had become markedly steeper with market participants pricing in just under a full 25 basis point rate hike in july this year and almost three 25 basis point rate hikes by the end of the year
2022-05-19;2022;May;REPORT;Negative;0.962654709815979;thereafter markets expected the hiking cycle to continue with six 25 basis point interest rate hikes expected in 2023 this suggested that markets saw the need for substantial policy action to secure mediumterm price stability reflecting the current very negative real short and longterm yields
2022-05-19;2022;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9655838012695312;the median participant response to the survey of monetary analysts sma showed that the first interest rate hike was still expected to take place in the fourth quarter of 2022 but the share of sma participants expecting an earlier liftoff had now increased to around 40
2022-05-19;2022;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.8794153928756714;the expected path after liftoff however was substantially shallower compared with the path suggested by market pricing
2022-05-19;2022;May;REPORT;Negative;0.980086088180542;this possibly indicated that rising term premia on the back of high remaining uncertainty about the pace of policy normalisation had contributed to the steeper forward curve with markets genuine expectations probably being somewhat lower than indicated by the forward curve
2022-05-19;2022;May;REPORT;Negative;0.907036542892456;higher uncertainty about expected euro shortterm money market rates as priced in by the market was in line with the premise of the ecbs reaction function becoming more datadependent

2022-05-19;2022;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9863802790641785;furthermore the recent strong recovery in equity prices reflected first and foremost a reversal of the earlier increase in the equity risk premium mirroring the improving risk sentiment
2022-05-19;2022;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9887675642967224;a more fundamental factor explaining the resilience of equity prices and of risk assets more generally was that the earnings outlook for euro area firms had remained relatively robust despite the war
