2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9789764285087585;as usual these dates had to be treated with caution because the market rates included term premia
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9887455105781555;allowing for such premia market pricing implied that the dfr would actually rise above zero somewhat later

2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Negative;0.8703612685203552;this was due to the relatively mild winter in europe and the redirection of imports of liquified natural gas from asia to europe which had more than offset the large drop in gas imports from russia
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.5907864570617676;concerning the outlook for gas prices it was important to recognise that supply shocks tended to have a more persistent effect on gas prices when inventories were low which was currently the case

2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Positive;0.964046061038971;across sectors the recovery in hours worked in services had accelerated more in the second and third quarters of 2021 than in the manufacturing sector
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9850730299949646;to assess how tight the labour market was it was useful to look at the ratio between the vacancy rate and the unemployment rate and to compare this ratio across the euro area and the united states

2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.978413462638855;the latest inflation data would be integrated more fully in the analysis for the march meeting
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.974316418170929;in recent months around half of the headline inflation rate had resulted directly from energy inflation but the contribution of food prices had increased
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9842847585678101;according to eurostats flash release headline inflation had increased slightly further to 51 in january 2021  from 50 in december and 49 in november

2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.7722313404083252;the rise in energy inflation could increasingly be explained both by higher electricity prices which had been affected by various policies and by higher gas prices
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9796226620674133;prices for unprocessed food had exceeded their projected price increase by more than than prices for processed food
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Positive;0.858607828617096;the latter mainly reflected increases in prices within the eus internal market amid global rises in both energy costs and prices for international commodities
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Negative;0.7781144380569458;with respect to nonenergy industrial goods neig inflation the contribution of durable goods had continued to increase which could be attributed to supply bottlenecks as well as to the energy price rise
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9936282634735107;however price dynamics for the other components of neig indicated that the increase in neig inflation was broadbased across items
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.990062415599823;the indirect contribution of energy to nonenergy inflation items was relevant in this context since all nonenergy sectors used energy as an input
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9767928123474121;typically the energy input was less than 10 of overall costs but energy price increases as high as 286 were going to affect many individual categories of goods
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9887973666191101;further up the pricing chain pipeline pressures for neig inflation continued to build up partly reflecting the rise in energy production costs
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.5982790589332581;import prices for intermediate goods remained at unusually high levels and domestic producer price inflation for nonfood consumer goods had increased further to stand at a new historical high
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9862577319145203;the annual rate of change in import prices for final nonfood consumer goods which had been negative for most of 2020 and had a dampening effect on neig inflation had increased further and added to pipeline pressures for neig
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9682160019874573;this reflected both the higher goods prices that euro area importers had to pay but also the effect of the depreciation of the euro
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9903025031089783;a range of indicators of underlying inflation had moved up to levels above 2
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9667647480964661;however there were important temporary factors behind this in particular the effects of bottlenecks and high energy prices
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.6447232365608215;a rise in the price of energy increased the price level for other goods in the inputoutput matrix across the board
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Negative;0.8934234976768494;however this did not necessarily imply that high inflation was going to persist
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9858881831169128;historically measures of underlying inflation were good predictors of future inflation as they were to some extent designed to reflect persisting developments
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.5643880367279053;but temporary factors were clearly also playing a role in the present situation
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9905904531478882;comparing recent headline inflation developments in the euro area and the united states many issues were similar in qualitative terms
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9927454590797424;however in quantitative terms hicp inflation excluding food and energy hicpx stood at 26 in december in the euro area while in the united states the cpi less food and energy was 55
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9760149121284485;while part of the higher inflation in the united states could be explained by the higher increases in rents and their larger weight in the cpi the biggest difference related to the effects on core inflation of supply disruptions bottlenecks and the reopening of the economy
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9079203009605408;these effects had so far been much more evident in the us data

2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9234933257102966;overall however there was no evidence of any big structural change in the behaviour of negotiated wages
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8158217668533325;nor did expectations of labour costs point to any evidence so far of significant secondround effects from the current high level of inflation
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Negative;0.990912675857544;regarding sources of domestic inflation it was noteworthy that in the euro area most energy was imported and import prices for energy had increased by almost 50 in the second half of 2021 this had led to a big drop in the terms of trade

2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.6815071105957031;at the same time price rises had become more widespread and most measures of underlying inflation had risen over recent months although the role of temporary factors related to the pandemic meant that the persistence of these increases was uncertain
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9930005073547363;the december and january inflation releases were assessed in terms of magnitude direction and surprise component
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9489980936050415;it was highlighted that for the euro area as a whole and for many countries the january figure was the highest level reached since the introduction of the euro

2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.947982907295227;this could be gauged from the reaction of markets to the release
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8441035151481628;it was stressed that a large part of the upward surprise was explained by energy inflation and it was argued that it thus stemmed from factors that did not reflect developments in the euro area domestic economy
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9911134839057922;however it was noted that for the euro area as a whole all of the main hicp components had surprised on the upside thus indicating broader price pressures than just those stemming from the energy component
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Negative;0.7464607357978821;it was observed that the surprise for january was the latest in a succession of underestimated outcomes and that it had occurred in spite of a large upward revision to the inflation outlook in the december staff projections
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9617236852645874;on the one hand the exceptional size of the recent projection errors was seen to be a testament to the uncertainty that forecasters were currently facing
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9589064717292786;on the other hand it was acknowledged that inflation could now be expected to be higher in the short run and that it would take longer for the inflation hump to recede
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9910891056060791;reference was made to the mechanical update of the shortterm projections incorporating the january figures which suggested that inflation could remain well above 2 for the entire year
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9736584424972534;this implied inflation above 2 for an extended period of time and raised the question of whether the deviations from the inflation target could still be described as moderate and transitory
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9874293208122253;such persistent deviations raised the risk that inflation could become entrenched in inflation expectations
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9892756342887878;looking further ahead it was suggested that increases in energy costs and other production costs had yet to pass fully through to consumer prices in large parts of the euro area and that the effect would then only show in the data for 2023 doubts were expressed as to whether inflation in 2023 would be below 2 as anticipated in the december staff projections
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9486678838729858;it was argued that it had become increasingly likely that inflation would converge to 2 in the medium term but from above the target rather than from below
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9794783592224121;reference was made to the average error in the staff projections for projected inflation two years ahead which was around threequarters of a percentage point and the fact that the recent downward bias in the projections followed a period of upward bias
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9496793746948242;this raised the questions of whether the underlying models were performing sufficiently well and whether the historical relationships underpinning the models and projections still held
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9912149906158447;moreover it was argued that the projected decline in inflation over the medium term was at odds with the fast absorption of labour market slack and strong demand in the coming years embedded in the december staff projections
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9792696833610535;this argued for putting more weight on other sources of information such as surveys expert judgement and incoming data in assessing the mediumterm outlook
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9716532230377197;it was recalled that a major element in the expected decline of inflation to below 2 over the medium term was the assumption included in the staff projections that energy commodity prices would evolve along their downwardsloping futures curves
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Negative;0.7347837686538696;alternative technical assumptions such as those derived from a random walk forecast would result in inflation above 2 in 2023 and 2024 it was also remarked that the projections might underestimate the structural upward pressure on energy prices stemming from the green transition
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Negative;0.7087938785552979;in addition it was argued that although not yet part of the official hicp the unprecedented rise in the costs of owneroccupied housing warranted consideration in the mediumterm outlook

2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9944407343864441;all members expressed concern over the latest upside surprises in the inflation figures which were also apparent when looking at seasonally adjusted monthonmonth price developments
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9809238910675049;it was remarked that the most vulnerable segments of the population were being hit hardest by high energy costs and inflation
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.970535933971405;at the same time the point was made that what mattered for monetary policy was the nature of the underlying economic forces and the implications of those forces for the mediumterm outlook
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9774680137634277;in addition monetary policy needed to be forwardlooking and not react mechanically to data releases related to past periods such as the recent inflation figures
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8109707832336426;it was argued that a distinction between supply and demand as well as between global and domestic influences was more meaningful than simple dichotomies contrasting temporary and persistent shocks
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.992482602596283;in this respect it was important to assess to what extent the latest inflation increases reflected the passthrough of past increases in global energy prices or instead pointed to changes in the domestic inflation process
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9928983449935913;it was observed that almost all of the upward revisions to euro area headline and core inflation between the september and december projection rounds could be explained by the energy price shock when both direct and indirect effects were taken into account
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9924667477607727;this amounted to a large termsoftrade shock to the euro area economy that implied substantial declines in real household incomes and corporate earnings which could translate into lower consumption and investment in the period ahead in turn suggesting a downward impact on the mediumterm inflation outlook
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8554120659828186;in this context it was reiterated that there were no incipient signs of sustained domestically generated inflation as that would require higher wage growth and further upward moves in inflation expectations
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Negative;0.994318425655365;in this respect the lack of evidence of stronger contractual wage growth and the fact that inflation expectations remained well anchored were seen as the key missing elements in the inflation picture
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.7698004841804504;data on past wage growth however were a lagging indicator and did not provide timely signals about future inflation
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8000495433807373;this was especially true at present when the available data related to a period in which the pandemic was still raging
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9862725734710693;more prominence should therefore be given to forwardlooking indicators such as those based on surveys
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9908668994903564;reference was made to the results of the ecbs corporate telephone survey which pointed to expectations of significantly higher wage growth compared with last year as well as significant labour shortages and a strong passthrough of input prices to final consumer prices possibly pointing to a steepening of the phillips curve
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9844762682914734;at the same time it was recalled that the december staff projections had already anticipated wage growth of around 3 for all the years of the projection horizon and that this had been judged to be compatible with inflation projections of around 2
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.973391592502594;the latest available data saw negotiated wages in the euro area growing by substantially less than 2
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9744375944137573;while it was pointed out that there was no evidence so far of secondround effects associated with the current high inflation rates members widely referred to an increased risk should inflation remain higher for longer
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.7024925947189331;inflation was outpacing wage growth in many countries
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Positive;0.5046881437301636;this eroded households purchasing power and was likely to trigger stronger wage increases over time
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9906033873558044;the view was expressed that for such secondround effects to emerge it did not matter whether the underlying drivers of inflation were supply or demand factors
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9160286784172058;given the lagged nature of wage data it would take some time before secondround effects could be observed in actual wage growth
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9864882826805115;at the same time it was pointed out that the backwardlooking inflation component in the wagesetting process was a stylised fact and thus part of forecasting models predicated on historical relationships
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9881120920181274;therefore the prevailing high inflation rates would be incorporated into the upcoming march staff projections although this would not imply per se an upward revision to the mediumterm inflation outlook given that the impact of the energy price shock and the termsoftrade shock would likely influence projected inflation in the opposite direction
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Negative;0.76930171251297;against this background compared with the expectations at the time of the december 2021 governing council meeting risks to the inflation outlook were tilted to the upside particularly in the near term

2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9806386828422546;overall it was seen as important to await the outcome of the march staff projections for a more integrated and holistic assessment of the outlook rather than jumping to conclusions based on partial analysis
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9930994510650635;as regards inflation expectations members took note that marketbased measures of longerterm inflation compensation had remained just below 2 and surveybased indicators had increased to 2 in the latest rounds of the survey of professional forecasters and consensus economics
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Positive;0.8514266610145569;this was seen as a welcome development and suggested that longerterm inflation expectations were well anchored at the 2 target while there were no signs of unanchoring on the upside
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9892555475234985;at the same time the rise in longerterm expectations and their surrounding probability distributions also indicated that there was no longer a risk of a downward unanchoring

2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8639222979545593;it was reiterated that in very uncertain times more focus should be on the expectations of firms and households so as to assess whether high actual inflation implied a risk of unanchoring
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Negative;0.7584052085876465;turning to the monetary and financial analysis members widely concurred with the assessment provided by mr lane in his introduction that overall financing conditions for the euro area economy had remained favourable
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9693940877914429;while market interest rates had increased since the governing councils december meeting bank lending rates for firms and households had remained at historically low levels

2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9878317713737488;it was noted in this respect that ecb banking supervision had recently completed the 2021 supervisory review and evaluation process srep cycle confirming the overall resilience of the euro area banking sector with significant institutions having maintained solid capital and liquidity positions in 2021 well in excess of regulatory requirements
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Positive;0.7980974316596985;banks were thus well placed to cope with the gradual removal of remaining supervisory support measures
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Negative;0.8457262516021729;monetary policy stance and policy considerations regarding the monetary policy stance members underlined that financing conditions remained favourable for all sectors of the economy

2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9898966550827026;it was noted that the combination of expectations of monetary tightening at the global level improved growth prospects tightening labour markets renewed upside surprises in inflation figures and rising inflation expectations had led markets to bring forward the expected date for a first ecb rate hike and to price in a faster normalisation after liftoff
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9840112328529358;this implied an endogenous tightening of financing conditions although real interest rates remained deeply in negative territory
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.6889749765396118;with respect to the implications for the monetary policy stance stemming from the inflation outlook members concurred that the latest figures suggested that inflation was likely to remain elevated for longer than had been expected in december with risks to the outlook remaining tilted to the upside particularly in the near term
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9921830296516418;accordingly there was broad agreement that the situation had changed and that the inflation narrative needed to be adjusted putting emphasis on optionality in the use of all instruments in the period ahead
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8621931076049805;the view was widely shared that convergence to the ecbs mediumterm inflation target was no longer a distant prospect thus making the fulfilment of the forward guidance criteria more likely within a shorter time span
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.976769208908081;some members argued that the likelihood that inflation would settle at around 2 over the medium term had already increased significantly with the outlook coming close to satisfying the conditions established in the forward guidance on interest rates
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9655570387840271;this was seen as requiring a timely adjustment of the still highly accommodative monetary policy stance

2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9902098178863525;in this context it was underlined that any conclusion on whether the conditions in the forward guidance on interest rates had been met was not predicated on the staff projections but was up to the judgement of the governing council based on its assessment of all relevant information with the staff macroeconomic projections being only one element
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Negative;0.8635188341140747;the remark was made that the performance of the projections models might be challenged by the prevailing high uncertainty which was seen as a further reason for putting less weight on the projections relative to other sources of information
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.973773717880249;it was recalled that the current formulation of the governing councils forward guidance on interest rates had been derived from the monetary policy strategy which called for forceful and persistent monetary policy action in the presence of the effective lower bound on interest rates
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9790408611297607;however it was remarked that the inflation outlook had evolved in the meantime and at the present stage the governing council should be careful not to introduce additional policy inertia ie

2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.7104769349098206;it was also stressed that it remained an open question whether the outcome of the march projections would show inflation reaching the ecbs target durably within the projection horizon which was a key condition for considering a rate increase under the forward guidance
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.6338697075843811;moreover it was underlined that such a scenario was conditional on financing conditions remaining favourable
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8070166707038879;with respect to the staff projections it was emphasised that the exceptional uncertainty around the duration of the inflation spike needed to be explained including the role of the energy price assumptions in determining the inflation outlook
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Negative;0.8261775970458984;it was recalled that the governing councils credibility was above all founded on its ability to maintain price stability which contributed to the wellbeing of the european people
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9247322678565979;against this background it was maintained that the governing council should avoid an overreaction to inflation developments that were assessed as being shortlived
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9830561876296997;changing the stance and the related communication at the current meeting was seen as premature and could jeopardise the recovery as the december eurosystem staff projections still showed inflation remaining below the governing councils target in the medium term without any visible signs of an unanchoring of inflation expectations or any sound evidence of emerging secondround effects on wages
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9925416707992554;all in all members widely agreed that the march ecb staff macroeconomic projections would allow the governing council to assess in greater depth the implications for the mediumterm inflation outlook of the new data accrued since december
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9397465586662292;it was noted that in view of the limited time until the governing councils march meeting incoming information was unlikely to lead to a substantially different or more benign inflation assessment but might instead imply another upward revision to the inflation outlook for the coming quarters
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9451083540916443;it was also cautioned however that despite the latest higher than expected inflation outcomes the extent of possible revisions in the march projections in particular for the mediumterm outlook remained an open issue

2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9760904312133789;in this context it was recalled that a clear distinction needed to be made between the interest rate forward guidance and the guidance for app net purchases which was based on a different criterion namely the need to reinforce the accommodative impact of the ecbs policy rates
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9200832843780518;a gradual and flexible conduct of monetary policy was seen as critical

2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9850605130195618;in this context the governing council needed to recognise that the elevated inflation figures were partly a result of global shocks and were neither caused by monetary policy nor could they be addressed by monetary policy without causing a sharp fall in domestic demand at a time when the economy was still recovering from the pandemic shock

2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9875071048736572;it needed to be recalled that the governing councils forward guidance and forwardlooking communication was always datadependant reflecting an expectation or a probability assessment that was conditional on the mediumterm inflation outlook

2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9694622755050659;compared with the assessment in december upside risks to the inflation outlook had increased particularly in the near term

2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9890468716621399;as the increase in inflation was becoming longerlasting than initially expected it was remarked that the governing council should avoid characterising inflation developments as temporary or transitory and instead stress its assessment that inflation was expected to decline in the course of the year
2022-03-03;2022;March;REPORT;Negative;0.8627416491508484;compared with december the outlook had changed and the likelihood of seeing inflation rates below 2 in 2023 had decreased significantly
