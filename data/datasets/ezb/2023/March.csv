2023-03-02;2023;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.7119569182395935;the view was expressed that given the still substantial distance to the prospective terminal rate there continued to be value  from a risk management perspective  in frontloading rate hikes at the present stage
2023-03-02;2023;March;REPORT;Positive;0.8720762729644775;in particular showing determination now to raise rates significantly further could help to avoid being forced into further rate hikes later on
2023-03-02;2023;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9844779968261719;in this context it was remarked that the riskfree forward curve suggested markets were expecting rate cuts not long after the terminal rate had been reached
2023-03-02;2023;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.7192187309265137;this was seen to be somewhat at odds with the governing councils communication in december that interest rates would need to stay at restrictive levels for inflation to return to the mediumterm target
2023-03-02;2023;March;REPORT;Negative;0.6148812174797058;at the same time this could be interpreted as markets having confidence that the ecb would be successful in stabilising inflation
2023-03-02;2023;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9743287563323975;in other words once inflation had returned to target interest rates could come down to a level consistent with the longrun steady statewhile there was broad agreement that tightening needed to continue reservations were expressed on the proposed communication of an intention for the march meeting
2023-03-02;2023;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.6454254984855652;the point was made that policy rates were coming closer to a level where caution was needed to ensure that monetary policy was not tightened excessively
2023-03-02;2023;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9435915350914001;in view of the high uncertainty the inflation outlook could change rapidly in either direction
2023-03-02;2023;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9844027757644653;this required a careful assessment of new data and of the effect of previous rate hikes on price dynamics
2023-03-02;2023;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9362163543701172;not least in view of the ecbs symmetric inflation target the risk of doing too much deserved as much consideration as the risk of doing too little
2023-03-02;2023;March;REPORT;Negative;0.8760586977005005;it was noted that the shortterm momentum in core inflation had also started to decline somewhat and allowing for transmission lags core inflation should come down further over time
2023-03-02;2023;March;REPORT;Negative;0.7445348501205444;moreover at the start of policy normalisation large buffers of savings accumulated by households and firms together with substantial pentup demand had ensured that monetary policy could be tightened without causing much harm to the real economy
2023-03-02;2023;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9837741851806641;although these buffers remained at high levels they had diminished
2023-03-02;2023;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9503103494644165;this implied that more caution was required as regards further tightening steps
2023-03-02;2023;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9812503457069397;the point was made that the proposed communication did not prevent adapting the intended change in the policy stance in march should it be required on the basis of substantial new information expressing an intention was different from giving a commitment
2023-03-02;2023;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9803173542022705;it merely reflected the fact that on the basis of the information available the probability of a change occurring was seen as insignificant
2023-03-02;2023;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9902632236480713;it conveyed the view that in the absence of abrupt changes in circumstances a further 50 basis point interest rate hike at the march meeting was consistent with a very wide range of possible scenarios for the way inflation would develop
2023-03-02;2023;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9893603324890137;an advance indication of such a move would therefore provide clarity about the nearterm direction of monetary policy
2023-03-02;2023;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9920199513435364;this reconciled communicating the intention to raise rates in march with a datadependent approachall in all it was seen as important to provide a firm signal of policy intentions for the march meeting while stating that the path of monetary policy following that meeting would be evaluated with an open mind in line with the datadependent approach
2023-03-02;2023;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9774438738822937;turning to the policies affecting the size and composition of the eurosystems balance sheet members widely agreed with mr lanes proposal on the key parameters for the reduction of the app portfolio and with the detailed operational modalities as described by ms schnabel and as set out in a dedicated ecb press release
2023-03-02;2023;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9900925755500793;in particular given the relatively small reinvestment amounts expected broad support was expressed among the members for a simple and neutral approach
2023-03-02;2023;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.993956446647644;this meant that the partial reinvestments over the period between march and the end of june would be conducted broadly in line with current practice
2023-03-02;2023;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9886237382888794;the remaining reinvestment amounts would be allocated proportionally to the share of redemptions across each constituent programme of the app and under the public sector purchase programme proportionally to the share of redemptions of each jurisdiction and across national and supranational issuers
2023-03-02;2023;March;REPORT;Positive;0.8719053864479065;just as the app had supported the monetary policy stance when it was introduced the reduction of the app portfolio had to be carried out in a way that would support smooth policy normalisation and transmission keeping the decline in the portfolio measured and predictableit was highlighted that tilting reinvestments in the corporate sector purchase programme portfolio more strongly towards issuers with a better climate performance would signal the ecbs continued commitment  without prejudice to the objective of price stability  to supporting the eus policies for achieving the climate goals of the paris agreement via a gradual decarbonisation of the eurosystems corporate bond holdings
2023-03-02;2023;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9865365624427795;members also agreed with the proposal to continue applying flexibility in reinvesting redemptions falling due in the pepp portfolio
2023-03-02;2023;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.6436475515365601;maintaining this existing flexibility was seen as an efficient preemptive approach to countering a potential reemergence of risks to the monetary policy transmission mechanism related to the pandemic
2023-03-02;2023;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9910571575164795;taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members upon a proposal by the president the governing council took the monetary policy decisions as set out in the relevant press releases
2023-03-02;2023;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9812418222427368;the members of the governing council subsequently finalised the monetary policy statement which the president and the vicepresident would as usual deliver at the press conference following the governing council meetingmonetary policy statementmonetary policy statement for the press conference of 2 february 2023press releasesmonetary policy decisionsdetailed modalities for reducing asset purchase programme holdings
