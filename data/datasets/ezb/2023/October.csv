2023-10-12;2023;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9911381602287292;in this context it was argued that when monetary policy had been close to the effective lower bound and inflation low there had had been a strong case for looking through supply shocks whereas at present the situation was very differentthese members also argued that a pause could give rise to speculation that the tightening cycle was over which increased the risk of a rebound in inflation
2023-10-12;2023;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9782336354255676;this situation would require another wave of monetary tightening later on which could have adverse consequences for real estate markets and financial stability more generally
2023-10-12;2023;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9881656169891357;not hiking could also send a signal of the governing council being more concerned about the economy and a potential recession than too high inflation
2023-10-12;2023;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9320268630981445;some members expressed a preference for maintaining rates at their current levels
2023-10-12;2023;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9619562029838562;these members underlined the fact that the governing council had made clear its decisions were datadependent
2023-10-12;2023;October;REPORT;Negative;0.7015331983566284;they viewed the data that had become available since july as on balance not supporting a further rate hike the economy had weakened substantially and inflation was projected to return to around 2 by the end of the projection horizon while the risks to the inflation outlook were now balanced
2023-10-12;2023;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9724004864692688;although oil prices had increased this could turn out to be temporary
2023-10-12;2023;October;REPORT;Negative;0.969884991645813;the 425 basis point increase in rates that had already taken place since the start of the tightening cycle was seen as sufficiently demonstrating the governing councils commitment to deliver on its mandate of price stabilitythese members also maintained that a lot of the passthrough of past rate hikes was still pending and not all of this was likely to be included in the central scenario implying that downside risks to economic growth could be significant
2023-10-12;2023;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9835314750671387;they saw little room for upside risks to the growth outlook
2023-10-12;2023;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9832968711853027;pausing at this meeting would also have the advantage of providing time to assess the impact of previous decisions on the economy and to evaluate whether the slowdown was deeper than expected and whether inflation was actually coming down as projected without requiring a further increase in interest rates
2023-10-12;2023;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9721227884292603;another consideration was that a further rate hike risked repeating the situation that had occurred in 2011 when interest rate increases had had to be reversed quickly in the face of the economic consequences of the sovereign debt crisis
2023-10-12;2023;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.806327760219574;against this background it was recalled that the ecb also had secondary objectives
2023-10-12;2023;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.6715483069419861;if the inflation target could be reached at the end of 2025 via a lower interest rate path thereby increasing the likelihood of a soft landing this would be preferable
2023-10-12;2023;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9902946949005127;the governing council also needed to take into account the economic and social costs of a possible hard landing
2023-10-12;2023;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9914008975028992;from a risk management perspective the point was made that the risks of hiking at the present time and later having to reverse course should the economy weaken by more than expected were larger than those of introducing a pause in the tightening cycle and having to increase rates at one of the coming meetingsmembers also agreed with the executive board proposal to continue applying flexibility in reinvesting redemptions falling due in the pepp portfoliotaking into account the foregoing discussion among the members upon a proposal by the president the governing council took the monetary policy decisions as set out in the monetary policy press release
