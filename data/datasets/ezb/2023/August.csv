2023-08-31;2023;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9769599437713623;a possible reason for this was seen in the muted response of longerterm interest rates that were still compressed by the large stock of assets on the eurosystems balance sheet with longterm rates broadly stable in 2023 after the sizeable initial increases observed in 2022 reference was made to indications that tighter financing conditions were starting to affect economic decisions elsewhere notably with regard to investment choicesoverall the riskfree forward rate curve remained somewhat above the levels observed prior to the governing councils previous monetary policy meeting
2023-08-31;2023;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9771639108657837;the downward shift observed in the last few weeks could be explained by market participants expecting lower growth rates to feed into lower inflation rates requiring lesspronounced interest rate increases

2023-08-31;2023;August;REPORT;Positive;0.6853908896446228;since then however the efficiency aspect had gained in relevance in line with the higher level of the key ecb interest rates
2023-08-31;2023;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9026870131492615;it was also clarified that this decision did not prejudge the outcome of the ongoing review of the ecbs operational framework
2023-08-31;2023;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9499555230140686;at the same time some members expressed reservations against a change in the remuneration of minimum reserves
2023-08-31;2023;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.7025269865989685;it was argued that remunerating minimum reserves at 0 below relevant market rates might add to the tightening effect of the monetary policy measures
2023-08-31;2023;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9936059713363647;it was also cautioned that changes in the remuneration of minimum reserves could raise questions about the objectives in the eurosystems reaction function related to central bank profits and losses together with concerns over financial independence
2023-08-31;2023;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9900272488594055;other members by contrast saw the minimum reserve requirement as a monetary policy tool that could be used to support or complement the intended restrictive monetary policy stance
2023-08-31;2023;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9872161746025085;these members preferred to increase the minimum reserve ratio to 2 also noting that before 2011 a minimum reserve ratio of 2 had been the rule
2023-08-31;2023;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.7678070068359375;it was argued that the governing council had a good case for taking another step in the normalisation of its policy instruments
2023-08-31;2023;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9525078535079956;this it could do by reversing the previous reduction to 1 decided in december 2011 as part of a package of nonstandard measures to support the bank lending channel and free up liquidity and collateral when monetary transmission had clearly been under stress
2023-08-31;2023;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9308354258537292;it was also recalled that banks had benefited from extraordinarily favourable refinancing terms and conditions not least under the tltros for an extended period of timehowever it was also recalled that before 2011 minimum reserves were remunerated at the mro rate
2023-08-31;2023;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.5230437517166138;moreover it was mentioned that the very rationale for minimum reserve requirements was now less clear in view of the prudential liquidity regulations for banks that had been introduced in response to the global financial crisis
2023-08-31;2023;August;REPORT;Positive;0.5350472927093506;overall caution was expressed against using the minimum reserve ratio as an active instrument for adjusting the monetary policy stancewith all these considerations in mind members expressed a willingness to join a broad consensus supporting the measure as proposed by mr lanewith respect to communication it was felt that the ecbs reaction function seemed to have been well understood by market participants
2023-08-31;2023;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9046192765235901;in line with the governing councils datadependent approach communication had to avoid signalling complacency to financial market participants and the public on the back of declining headline inflation and slowing growth as this would ease financial and financing conditions and thereby counteract the governing councils intention to bring inflation back to target in a timely manner
2023-08-31;2023;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.98605877161026;there was broad agreement that the governing council would ensure that the key ecb interest rates would be set at sufficiently restrictive levels for as long as necessary to achieve a timely return of inflation to its 2 mediumterm target
2023-08-31;2023;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9886946082115173;it was felt that the word set was consistent with preserving optionality which however did not include the possibility of a rate cut at the september meeting
