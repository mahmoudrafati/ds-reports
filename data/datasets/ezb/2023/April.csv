2023-04-20;2023;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9835663437843323;at the same time credit supply was also playing a role with the recent tensions in financial markets likely to reinforce the tightening of credit conditions and banks becoming more sensitive to the risk of deposit outflows and therefore less willing to lend
