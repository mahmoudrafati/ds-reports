2020-10-08;2020;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9318690896034241;highyield bond spreads had even fallen by nearly 50 basis points
2020-10-08;2020;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9180055260658264;one factor that might explain the general resilience of financial markets was the growing divergence between the number of covid19 fatalities which remained stable at low levels and the number of new infections which had more than tripled since the beginning of august 2020 many market participants believed that this divergence  if it were to persist  would lower the risk of widespread lockdowns resulting in less of a downside risk to economic activity
2020-10-08;2020;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9677004218101501;it was notable that there was a growing dispersion in the extent of easing of financial conditions across advanced economies with the euro area lagging behind
2020-10-08;2020;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9819470643997192;the dispersion could largely be explained by two factors namely developments in global stock markets and shifts in exchange rates

2020-10-08;2020;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8997588157653809;idiosyncratic factors could partially explain these divergences
2020-10-08;2020;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9856644868850708;one factor was the sectoral composition of stock markets as despite the recent correction the technology sector continued to benefit most from the pandemic

2020-10-08;2020;October;REPORT;Negative;0.7327395677566528;a second factor was the fall in equity risk premia that had contributed substantially to the rise in valuations in the united states

2020-10-08;2020;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9517678022384644;empirical evidence suggested that a marginal increase in inflation expectations tended to raise stock valuations and this effect was considerably greater when real rates were in negative territory
2020-10-08;2020;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9383405447006226;negative real yields also reduced the opportunity cost of holding a zerocoupon asset such as gold which helped explain in part why gold prices had increased so strongly over the course of this year
2020-10-08;2020;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9879037737846375;furthermore declining real rates were also likely to have accelerated the depreciation of the us dollar

2020-10-08;2020;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9831860065460205;more specifically modelbased analysis identified two main drivers behind the recent shifts in exchange rates
2020-10-08;2020;October;REPORT;Positive;0.990583062171936;the first and most important one was the substantial improvement in global risk sentiment ie
2020-10-08;2020;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9345603585243225;the reversal of previous safehaven flows into the united states
2020-10-08;2020;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9918749928474426;the decisive policy actions taken by euro area governments to fight the crisis had likely contributed to the improvement in risk sentiment
2020-10-08;2020;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9874917268753052;a second driver was likely related to monetary policies implemented in the united states and the euro area in part reflecting differences in conventional policy space before the pandemic

2020-10-08;2020;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9902011752128601;one important factor behind the rally in global risk assets was related to positive global macroeconomic surprises  as reflected in the citigroup economic surprise index for advanced economies which stood at an alltime high

2020-10-08;2020;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9703035354614258;in part this reflected an increase in inactivity which was likely linked to the suddenness of the loss of employment in march and april
2020-10-08;2020;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9912322163581848;most of the adjustment in the labour market had stemmed from a decline in average hours worked which mainly reflected the impact of job retention schemes
2020-10-08;2020;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9910768270492554;looking ahead although surveys and highfrequency indicators had improved recently they still pointed to employment losses in the third quarter despite the effect of the labour market policies in place

2020-10-08;2020;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9779213070869446;turning to wage developments the large takeup of the shorttime work and temporary layoff schemes had led to a strong divergence between growth in compensation per employee and growth in compensation per hour in the first and second quarters of 2020 negotiated wage growth allowing for oneoff effects had declined only moderately thus far but stood clearly below the levels reached in 2018 and 2019 marketbased indicators of longerterm inflation expectations had returned to their prepandemic levels but the increase had been much smaller than in the united states and they still remained at very subdued levels
