2020-02-20;2020;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9919317364692688;the trade agreement appeared to be the most significant as it had helped consolidate the general improvement in market sentiment that had gained momentum in early september 2019 expectations that monetary policy would remain highly accommodative both in the united states and in the euro area further supported the improved market sentiment

2020-02-20;2020;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9348807334899902;a second factor had been the prevailing high level of oil inventories in oecd countries
2020-02-20;2020;February;REPORT;Negative;0.7137246131896973;combined with a global economy much less reliant on oil than in the past this cushioned the expected impact of supplyside disruptions on the oil price
2020-02-20;2020;February;REPORT;Positive;0.8349834084510803;a third factor might have been the general underlying improvement in market sentiment
2020-02-20;2020;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9885741472244263;this improved sentiment had been visible in global bond markets since early september 2019 following indications that a phaseone trade deal between the united states and china was within reach

2020-02-20;2020;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9885537624359131;this might partly be linked to the resumption of net asset purchases by the ecb which had removed additional duration risk from the market
2020-02-20;2020;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9922009706497192;in addition the decline in term premia might be related to the reduced uncertainty around the outlook for shortterm interest rates

2020-02-20;2020;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9943722486495972;this pattern of moderate growth reflected the ongoing weakness of international trade in an environment of continued global uncertainties which had particularly affected the euro area manufacturing sector and had also dampened investment growth
2020-02-20;2020;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9696425199508667;at the same time the services and construction sectors remained more resilient despite some moderation in the second half of 2019 nowcasting models which took recent data releases into account pointed to a stabilisation in growth at low rates below estimates of potential growth
2020-02-20;2020;February;REPORT;Negative;0.947821319103241;the eurocoin indicator had remained unchanged in december as the impact of the positive stock market performance had been offset by persistent pessimism among firms in the manufacturing sector
