2020-04-09;2020;April;REPORT;Positive;0.7998459935188293;as outlined by mr lane in his introduction members agreed that a first element of the policy response was to safeguard ample liquidity in the banking system by ensuring banks continued access to funding at attractive conditions as a necessary element to guard against a potential credit crunch
2020-04-09;2020;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9679979085922241;however it was also argued that this was not sufficient to ensure that the liquidity made available to banks would be passed on to the endusers
2020-04-09;2020;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9333279728889465;it was pointed out that whereas during the financial crisis of 2008 banks were at the heart of the problem the current situation differed in the sense that problems would materialise first in the real economy and would subsequently be reflected in banks balance sheets
2020-04-09;2020;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9643763899803162;members also agreed that the second element of the proposed policy response namely to protect the continued flow of credit to the real economy was of paramount importance
2020-04-09;2020;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9938952326774597;under the current conditions however it was seen as more difficult to ensure that the liquidity provided via monetary policy operations reached those that were most in need such as smes as problems in the real economy risked impairing credit flows to businesses

2020-04-09;2020;April;REPORT;Negative;0.6789778470993042;agreement also prevailed with regard to the third element of the required monetary policy response namely safeguarding the monetary policy stance by averting a procyclical tightening of financing conditions in the economy
2020-04-09;2020;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9869797229766846;however it was cautioned that instruments affecting the monetary policy stance would only become fully effective once the spread of the coronavirus had been contained by other policies
2020-04-09;2020;April;REPORT;Negative;0.6199689507484436;at the same time it was recalled that the ecbs monetary policy had been highly accommodative since the financial crisis

2020-04-09;2020;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9813547730445862;against this background all members agreed with the package of monetary policy measures proposed by mr lane in his introduction namely first offering additional ltros to provide immediate liquidity support to the euro area banking system at an interest rate equal to the deposit facility rate second applying more favourable terms to all tltro iii operations during the period from june 2020 to june 2021 and third adding a temporary envelope of 120 billion to the volume of net asset purchases
2020-04-09;2020;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9939277172088623;overall the package was seen as appropriate to address the three elements of the proposed policy response though some nuances were expressed with regard to individual components

2020-04-09;2020;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9793906211853027;additional net purchases would support policy transmission to the long end of the riskfree yield curve and provide some form of backstop for public and private bond markets
2020-04-09;2020;April;REPORT;Negative;0.973084568977356;however some reservations were also expressed regarding the case for expanding the public sector purchase programme as a means of preserving or lowering the riskfree yield curve at a time when higherrated government bond yields had fallen to record low levels in an environment of heightened risk aversion
2020-04-09;2020;April;REPORT;Negative;0.4798574149608612;it was also pointed out that in normal circumstances the relationship between the ecbs capital key and the riskfree yield curve was stable whereas under the current conditions this relationship was distorted by a shift into safe assets calling for temporary and tactical flexibility in the app purchases to address liquidity issues arising from this flight to safety
2020-04-09;2020;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9339995980262756;it was argued that the provision of the additional envelope until the yearend would allow enough flexibility in the implementation of the purchases to temporarily target markets where conditions were particularly tight
2020-04-09;2020;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9807393550872803;while it was confirmed that the parameters guiding the app remained in place the timeline for the convergence of the ecbs sovereign bond holdings towards the capital key would allow some flexibility for purchases within the existing parameters
