2020-01-16;2020;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.7285506129264832;there was also some discussion about how climaterelated policies including the european commissions green deal package should be taken into account in the projection exercises with members contending that there was a need to step up efforts to understand the economic consequences of climate change

2020-01-16;2020;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9795978665351868;it needed to be stressed that the forward guidance formulation  by tightly linking the likely future path of policy rates to an inflation outlook that was sufficiently close to but below 2 as well as a consistent rise in observed underlying inflation  ensured that financial conditions would adjust in accordance with changes to the inflation outlook
2020-01-16;2020;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.8204221129417419;at the same time it was seen as important to stress that the governing council was attentive to potential side effects of its monetary policy measures
