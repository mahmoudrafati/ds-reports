2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9948076605796814;while labour cost pressures have so far remained resilient amid tighter labour markets the weaker growth momentum is delaying their passthrough to inflation
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9388515949249268;over the medium term the increase in inflation will be supported by our monetary policy measures and the recovery in euro area growth dynamics

2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.7332583665847778;overall our accommodative monetary policy stance including the measures taken today will safeguard favourable bank lending conditions and will continue to support access to financing including for those affected most by the ramifications of the coronavirus and in particular for small and mediumsized enterprises

2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9867032766342163;in particular measures such as providing credit guarantees are needed to complement and reinforce the monetary policy measures taken today
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.4994533658027649;we welcome the commitment of the euro area governments and the european institutions to act now strongly and together in response to the repercussions of the further spread of the coronavirus
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9302588105201721;before we take your questions we would like to express our profound gratitude to all those who are dedicating their time and efforts in saving lives and containing the spread of the coronavirus
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8074113130569458;   my first question would be about the rationale for not cutting interest rates today
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.7681385278701782;could you give us the reason why there was no rate cut today
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9290916919708252;is it because there was not enough support for such a move within the governing council or maybe you all considered this is counterproductive
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9136061072349548;thats my first question
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8441318869590759;another question is about the issue you mentioned as the last which is this extra envelope of qe
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9793821573257446;have you also discussed this part of adding that envelope change your issue and issuer limits of the current programme and also will the decisions change anything with regards to the orientation of the app towards meeting the capital key
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9722566604614258;president lagarde i would first of all like to indicate to you that we very much operated in the same setting at the governing council of the ecb
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9877620935440063;in other words some members were in the room other members were online and participated fully to the discussions
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9182220101356506;we innovated
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.7534131407737732;we had a good outcome so much so that we actually had a unanimous decision on the various elements of the package that i have announced to you earlier on
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9256269335746765;so this unanimous decision that was reached today was clearly determined by the fact that we believe that we have the most efficient best targeted and most focused set of tools to address the kind of risks that we are facing under the current circumstances
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8522607088088989;so if we are to compare one instrument versus the other we certainly considered all together that the use of this additional 120 billion asset purchase programme on the top of preexisting programmes was the most efficient response to the market excess sensitivities that we see at the moment
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9090704917907715;thats question one
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.909954845905304;your second question had to do with how we are going to organise this asset purchase programme
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9860659241676331;i can assure you on that page that first of all we will make use of all the flexibilities that are embedded in the framework of the asset purchase programme and that second at the end of the asset purchase programme we will converge towards the capital keys
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9811034202575684;a question on the economy with the risks pointed clearly to the downside
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Negative;0.8727484941482544;can the euro zone avoid a recession this year
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.7448777556419373;what will happen with the strategy review will it be postponed or put on hold given that you cant even hold public hearings
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9539479613304138;president lagarde i think it is clear to all of us that the economies of the world and certainly the economies of the euro area are facing a major shock
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9669755697250366;i think the response to your question will clearly depend on the speed the strength and the collective approach that will be taken by all players and as i have said at the very beginning of this introductory statement first and foremost and on the frontline in our analysis of the situation are the fiscal authorities and the european institutions that harness fiscal authorities and advise in that relation
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Positive;0.7601951956748962;so that is the reason why we are strongly encouraging and hoping for that ambitious and coordinated fiscal response that i have mentioned
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.851845383644104;second the strategy review is clearly deferred for the moment and we have in particular decided to postpone by a matter of six weeks the first next big meeting that we had in our deliberations
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9794966578483582;so instead of focusing on 1 april we are now looking at the end of may
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9877289533615112;we will determine based on the development of circumstances and the success in containing and delaying the spreading of this virus how and when and at what speed and under what circumstances and using what tools we will be able to have our deliberations within the governing council but more importantly our reachout effort in order to include academics nongovernmental organisations members of parliament and representatives of civil society at large
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9319365620613098;because clearly the facilities that we had and our determination to reach out is impaired by the circumstances under which many of our euro area governments are now handing the risk situation that theyre facing
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Negative;0.823756217956543;id like to hear your response to the travel restrictions announced by president donald trump yesterday evening in particular as regards what impact that could have on the global economy and whether you think the responses of various governments to the virus outbreak and the spread of the virus could plunge the global economy into recession this year
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9308289289474487;secondly just to go back to a point that was already raised on issuer limits do you need to raise the selfimposed issuer limits on the qe programme
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9111856818199158;president lagarde our mandate is price stability and clearly in the face of the current circumstances we have to use all the tools that we have available in order to almost surgically support and contribute our part to this collective approach that is badly needed
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9558321833610535;im not going to comment on decisions that are made by a government outside the euro area
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Positive;0.8448683023452759;our job in that respect is to analyse the economic consequences that will result from those decisions and to assess which segment of the economy will need support and will benefit from the tools that we are deploying at the moment
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9850238561630249;in terms of issuer limits ive already discussed that matter during the previous question and it is clear that we will use in the work that we do in the coming weeks and months all the flexibility that is embedded in the framework of the asset purchase programme
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9728775024414062;if you look carefully at the introductory statement we do put some emphasis on the private sector bonds because we believe that that is where there is currently acute sensitivity and clearly in due course and depending on developments on all the markets where we operate we will have to target and use the flexibility that is needed in order to respond to the excess sensitivities that we see
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9316414594650269;first is this your dowhateverittakes moment and did you expect to have one so quickly
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9567126631736755;the second point is by not cutting rates today it makes the ecb look a little outofstep with the fed and the bank of england
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9850313663482666;does that raise concerns about currency  subconscious or unintended  devaluations competitive devaluations
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Negative;0.7984837293624878;because the euro rallied a tiny bit after todays decision
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9609811305999756;president lagarde we do not determine our monetary policy stance on the basis of currency variations
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.976153552532196;we are attentive to it but this is not a determining factor and the euro depreciates appreciates redepreciates
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9438998699188232;i think the key issue is currently to face the fundamentals of the economy and to make sure that the liquidity risk doesnt materialise that the credit continues to flow to the economy and that we address the market excess sensitivities in order to restore some stability
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.49293187260627747;thats what we are concerned about
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.7220975756645203;i remember saying when my predecessor and friend president draghi left and when i had interviews before the european parliament that i would hope that i would never have to do whatever it takes
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9629137516021729;what is good about our todays deliberations is that there was rallying support around the table to use all the tools available and to consider adjusting our instruments going forward in order to target those risks that we see as threats to stability in the euro area
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8594772815704346;i dont have a claim to history for being whateverittakes number two
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9642975926399231;i really would like all of us to join forces and i very much hope that the fiscal authorities will appreciate that we will only deal with the shock if we come together
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.7829139828681946;the additional net asset purchases limits such as the issuer limits might become a problem quickly or more quickly for example in the case of germany

2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9278404116630554;does the decision not to reduce the deposit rate also have to do with the changed assessment that the rate is already closer to the socalled reversal rate than previously assumed
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8339453339576721;president lagarde on the latter one its very simple we are certainly not at the reversal rate
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.785158634185791;i mean if we were at the reversal rate we would not see the growth of credit as i have described for you both to the households sector and to the enterprises sector
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8966315984725952;so no we are not at the reversal rate and we are certainly not at the lower bound rate
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9878854751586914;if in the future it is necessary for the purpose of dealing with the risks at the time to address that through the dfr we will do so
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9455083608627319;on the other point i think i have dealt extensively with these issuer limits and all i have to say at this moment again is that we will use all flexibilities embedded in the framework of our asset purchase programme and bear in mind that we are likely to see increased debt issuance on the part of a few countries if only to deal with the fiscal resources that they will have to mobilise in order to put in place the healthcare systems that will be needed to respond to the spreading of the disease
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9049781560897827;thats also a factor to have in mind

2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.6623467206954956;president lagarde on the eurozone level  and at the european level at large but im more concerned about the euro area of course in my position  i think all governments have to be ondeck and ready to act
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9723777174949646;i also think that all the european institutions have to join forces and rally around this collective package that needs to be put in place

2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9677526950836182;secondly you said todays decision was unanimous but was a case made for a more expansionary package
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.7285623550415039;president lagarde as ive said the decision was unanimous and that unanimity i think carries a long way in demonstrating our resolve to deal with the issues
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9494085311889648;now as to markets first of all it takes a little bit of time generally for decisions to be analysed digested and appreciated
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8827236890792847;the fact that we are dealing with this full allotment liquidity facility at reduced rate compared with the current situation the fact that we are putting in place a massive targeted longterm refinancing system that is available to all with a particular focus on smes and with multipliers that are significant
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9922425746917725;if you look at the volume of lending that can be accessed were talking about 50 relative to the previous loan book if you will were talking about an entry rate of 25 basis points and were talking about an ultimate interest rate based on the track record of the lending institution of 75 basis points

2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9851924180984497;the ecb can provide cheap money but the most important problem at the moment might be that banks are more reluctant to pass on credit because of the risks
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9723143577575684;is it necessary to have some form of national or maybe european guarantee schemes to ensure that
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9096290469169617;youve mentioned that there will probably be a lot of debt issuance in the future

2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.965458333492279;would it be an option to activate for example the omt programme or could there be other possibilities to help certain countries
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9316493272781372;president lagarde on the guarantee scheme i think i was very explicit in the introductory statement on that but im happy to restate it
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.5150774121284485;we are making available to all enterprises with a focus on smes massive refinancing means at very preferential rates and in significant amounts
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9760966897010803;to encourage banks to actually use that facility we believe and we have put in the introductory statement that guarantee schemes would very much be in order
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8757174015045166;so in other words its a guarantee that is put together by the state or an agency of the state or a european agency in order to support all a part of the risk that is actually taken by the bank in extending lending facility to an enterprise notably in a sector which is particularly exposed
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9460251331329346;i mean that is how we believe that the financing were putting in place will be most efficient
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9864522218704224;now whether that is conducted at the national level or at the european level is for the policymakers to decide
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.962220311164856;what matters to us is that it is in place as rapidly as is possible

2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.928010880947113;so that was my point number one
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9870065450668335;my point number two has to do with more debt issuance coming down the road depending on the fiscal expansion that will be determined by policymakers

2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9867444634437561;we strongly believe that the asset purchase programme temporary large envelope with no monthly predetermined allocation which helps us actually focus on how the risks develop is the most efficient tool that we can use under the present circumstances and we shall use it
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9848048686981201;the reason we are referring to the private sector contribution is that it is currently a sector that is under massive stress and causing significant and excessive sensitivities on markets and pose a risk to stability but flexibility will be used
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9816505908966064;when we assess the risk and we measure where it is we will apply this flexibility

2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9551578760147095;is it the programmes

2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.7097015380859375;president lagarde let me come back a little bit to the risk channels as we see them
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.5336277484893799;we are facing something that is different from the great financial crisis by the way at this point in time
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9906935095787048;we analyse it as a crisis that is fuelled by a supply shock followed by a demand shock and with great financial uncertainty
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9688764810562134;so those are the three sources that we identify
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9845024943351746;in the face of that our analysis is that the response should be fiscal first and foremost
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9647942185401917;so i dont think that anybody should expect any central bank to be the line of first response
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.6511149406433105;its fiscal first and foremost
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9797013998031616;so if you look at the fiscal measures that have been announced for the moment in the euro area which we have done yesterday if you recap all that has been announced  not including the european commission  you arrive at a total of about 27 billion which is more or less a quarter of 1 of the gdp of the euro area
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.7718855142593384;hence the reason why we are calling in our introductory statement for an ambitious and collective fiscal response
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9464179873466492;i believe that from the european central banks viewpoint we are expecting and anticipating that this response will be ambitious and collective and we are doing our part using the tools that we have which we believe will be best targeted to the risks that we see likely to develop in the near future
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9886743426322937;that is liquidity risk that is an interruption or significant slowdown of the credit flow to the economy and the financial excessive sensitivities that we see at the moment which create instability
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9407044649124146;we are trying to address these three risks with the three tools that i have just mentioned
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Positive;0.5614277720451355;unlimited and generous access to liquidity number one considerably more attractive targeted longterm refinancing operation particularly for the small and mediumsized enterprises and a specific envelope of 120 billion for a special asset purchase programme that will deploy and use all the flexibility embedded in the framework of the app
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.839799702167511;i call it decisiveness im sorry to say
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.6217254996299744;my first question is in relation to deflation risk
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Negative;0.7317318916320801;already in february we saw inflation going down to 12 and energy inflation declined by 03
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.761397123336792;taking into account the developments in the oil price market do you foresee that the current stimulus is sufficient to maintain and to secure price stability going forward over the next few months
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.865460991859436;my second question is in relation to the spread you mentioned
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9124473929405212;its part of your mission to maintain the spreads narrower but if it were to become a major problem for the euro zone as it was the case back in 2012 could you secure or could this crisis take precedent in your deliberations and you could deliver a sufficient package through app
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8289865851402283;president lagarde let me just backtrack a little bit and share with you the macroeconomic analysis that we have of the current situation
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9106929898262024;we regard the current shock as severe but still temporary if the right set of policy measures are decided by all players
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Negative;0.5173837542533875;what happens after a severe and temporary shock provided that the right measures have been taken by all the players is that the economy will then bounce back
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8841381072998047;the exact timing of that is uncertain
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.751411497592926;as you know for all of us that try to do a bit of forecasting we initially thought that the shock would be during the first quarter and the rebound would progressively start in the second
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Positive;0.8029470443725586;clearly everybody knows its moving to the line and its going to be a shock for the first two quarters and the rebound will be in the second half
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9659364819526672;clearly that schedule in and of itself and that timetable is shifting gradually
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Negative;0.7015760540962219;so the best thing to say is that there will be a rebound
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Negative;0.8230105042457581;to time it precisely is uncertain but we still very much hope that given that the right measures are taken by all the players there will be a temporary nature associated with that very severe shock
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Negative;0.8328081965446472;if that is the case our forecast for 21 very slightly reduced already will reflect the bounce back of the economy probably in the second half
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9619826674461365;2022 will also have a much better forecast and the numbers will be published this afternoon in our macroeconomic projections
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9537541270256042;so with that clearly there is a shift that we are seeing in the economic cycle but we still see inflation in 2022 at or about 16 as will be published later on
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9680164456367493;we shall see because clearly all this forecast will have to be revisited on the basis of the policies that are taken by all the players in the next few weeks i hope and not months
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9396949410438538;so i hope that addresses your issue of the inflation movement as we forecast it
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9694573879241943;it will be lower than expected this year its obvious
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9454704523086548;even if you take out the oil shock which will have an impact clearly the tradeoff between the positive and the negative impact on inflation of the current development whether its a demand or a supply shock and the contribution of the demand versus supply to the current shock is going to be determined probably in a while but we cannot tell exactly how that tradeoff will take place
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9542246460914612;its very likely that inflation will be lower than whatever we had forecasted this year
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9016702771186829;i would be dishonest if i was telling you something different but what im trying to tell you is that we hope very much for a temporary nature of all these developments followed by a bounce back that will take us back to a medium term that will be more in line with our forecast
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8425304293632507;all we know for sure is that risks are definitely tilted to the downside thats for sure
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.809314489364624;you have called upon national governments and other authorities to launch more urgent fiscal action
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9518243670463562;dont you think that the ecb as bank supervisor has to act too for example by lowering countercyclical buffers of capital or changing the tiering system on excess reserves
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.986254096031189;president lagarde i dont mean to be rereading something that maybe youve read but there was a press release that was just issued by ecb banking supervision and clearly as of now because that was decided earlier in the day by the ecb which had to approve those new measures banks can fully avail of capital and liquidity buffers including pillar 2 guidance
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9801637530326843;banks will benefit from relief in the composition of capital for pillar 2 requirements and ecb will consider operational flexibility in the implementation of supervisory measures depending on bankspecific circumstances
2020-03-12;2020;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.980377733707428;so i think in relation to buffers thats a clear use of all available buffers as they were designed for the current circumstances that we are facing
