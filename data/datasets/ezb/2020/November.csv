2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9937536120414734;however the momentum had slowed more recently and downside risks were related to increasing covid19 infection rates globally and to geopolitical factors
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.98929762840271;since the governing councils september monetary policy meeting the exchange rate of the euro had remained broadly stable both against the us dollar and in nominal effective terms
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Positive;0.49530908465385437;turning to euro area developments members underlined that there had been both positive and negative news since the last monetary policy meeting
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Positive;0.5633806586265564;euro area real gdp had contracted by 118 quarter on quarter in the second quarter of 2020 however following the trough in april 2020 the euro area economy had rebounded strongly in the third quarter likely more than had been expected in the september ecb staff projections making up a large part of the contraction in the first half of the year
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Negative;0.534842312335968;however the strength of the rebound might also have reflected that countries had eased containment measures too much too soon
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9935935139656067;rising covid19 infection rates were seen as undermining confidence again and leading to additional containment measures generating a loss in growth momentum in the fourth quarter earlier and at a faster pace than had been foreseen
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8954227566719055;reference was made to the level of the composite output pmi which had fallen below 50 and to the fact that the pmi for new business had fallen back even more strongly
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9300345778465271;no data released so far had incorporated the recent announcements of further containment measures
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9741443395614624;as in march the economic situation was once again changing rapidly
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Negative;0.7662700414657593;it could not be excluded that the euro area or at least some countries would experience a doubledip recession
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9433228373527527;the euro area economic outlook was seen to depend crucially on the effectiveness of administrative measures and the infection dynamics of the pandemic with the magnitude and duration of a further downturn being very uncertain
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8628073930740356;it was noted that the restrictions being implemented now tended to be more targeted than in the spring either at regions or at sectors and could therefore have a more limited effect on activity than earlier in the year
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9844538569450378;it was also remarked that the rate of infections appeared to be more relevant for economic activity than the stringency of containment measures which varied considerably
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Negative;0.7331652641296387;nevertheless it was clear that while some sectors  such as manufacturing and construction  would be less affected in the euro area than had been the case in the more general lockdowns earlier in the year others  such as entertainment and leisure or tourism  would be heavily affected by the new restrictions
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.7044564485549927;members were of the view that in the period ahead containment measures could be expected to become more stringent and to last longer than previously anticipated
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9642128944396973;the winter months would be challenging in terms of limiting the spread of the virus and a sequence of temporary circuit breaker lockdowns might prove to be necessary
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9130290746688843;as a result the growth trajectory could be bumpier than previously projected
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9824303388595581;at the same time it was recalled that the economy had rebounded very strongly after the lockdowns in the first wave of the pandemic and that a similar dynamic recovery might be expected in the future
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9840987324714661;however it was unclear whether the liquidity buffers that firms and households had built up in recent months would prove to be sufficient to withstand a renewed deterioration in the economy in the period ahead
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9487887024879456;the emergence of the second wave of the pandemic could lead to more widespread business closures in a number of sectors for example retail trade
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Negative;0.6533876061439514;moreover the point was made that governments might be more prudent in easing containment measures after the experience of the summer months
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9213736653327942;as a result growth figures for 2021 as a whole could be adversely affected
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.7713925242424011;against this background members argued that looking ahead it would be important to consider the possibility that the pandemic might have longerlasting effects both on the demand side and on the supply side reducing potential growth
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9928128123283386;concerns were also expressed about the possibility of nonlinear effects arising from financial amplification channels and about the impact of the pandemic on balance sheet positions of firms households banks and governments particularly given the persistence of the crisis
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9880071878433228;overall it was emphasised that there was no clear tradeoff between containment measures required to reduce the spread of the virus and the impact on the economy and it was recognised that ultimately concerns about the economy would remain until a vaccine or effective treatment became widely available which could take some time
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.985191285610199;in this context members emphasised the role of both national and european fiscal policy in cushioning the impact on the economy of necessary containment measures
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9843036532402039;in particular it was regarded as positive news that additional fiscal stimulus was being announced at the same time as new measures to contain the spread of the virus
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9298043847084045;these new fiscal measures clearly went beyond those assumed in the september staff projections
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9813928008079529;members exchanged views on the extent to which the latest developments were still broadly consistent with the baseline scenario in the september ecb staff projections or whether revisions in the upcoming december eurosystem staff projections were likely to result in the baseline being closer to the severe scenario included in the september projections
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9920390844345093;while the september baseline scenario had assumed some resurgence of the virus and the need for ongoing containment measures recent developments were seen as constituting a clear downside risk to the projections
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Negative;0.983262300491333;it was highlighted that uncertainty remained very high as it had been throughout the year
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9897117614746094;however by the time of the december monetary policy meeting information would be available on major geopolitical developments  such as the result of the us presidential election and brexit  as well as the initial evidence on the effectiveness of the new restrictions in containing the spread of the virus and their impact on the economy
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9869092106819153;moreover by that time draft national budgetary plans and their assessment by the european commission should also have become available together with further indications on the prospective use of ngeu funds
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.5436508059501648;overall members considered the risks surrounding the growth outlook to be clearly tilted to the downside
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Negative;0.8901427388191223;this assessment largely reflected the recent resurgence in covid19 infections the associated intensification of containment measures and the high uncertainty surrounding the timeline of the pandemic and the implications for economic and financial conditions
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Positive;0.7672601342201233;regarding fiscal policies an ambitious and coordinated fiscal stance remained critical in view of the sharp contraction in the euro area economy
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9939075112342834;while fiscal measures taken in response to the pandemic emergency should as much as possible be targeted and temporary in nature weak demand from firms and households and the heightened risk of a delayed recovery warranted continued support from national fiscal policies
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Positive;0.6847864389419556;the three safety nets endorsed by the european council for workers businesses and sovereigns provided important funding support in this context
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8853017687797546;the key role of the ngeu package was stressed as well as the importance of it becoming operational without delay
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9845582842826843;provided that the funds were deployed for productive public spending and accompanied by productivityenhancing structural reforms the ngeu programme would contribute to a faster stronger and more uniform recovery and would thereby enhance resilience and the growth potential of eu member states economies supporting the effectiveness of monetary policy in the euro area
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Positive;0.7307786345481873;such structural policies were particularly important in addressing longstanding structural and institutional weaknesses and in accelerating the green and digital transitions
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9838751554489136;with regard to price developments there was broad agreement with the assessment presented by mr lane in his introduction
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8893100023269653;euro area annual hicp inflation had decreased to 03 in september 2020 from 02 in august reflecting developments in the prices of energy nonenergy industrial goods and services
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9917545318603516;on the basis of oil price dynamics and taking into account the temporary reduction in german vat headline inflation was likely to remain negative until early 2021 moreover nearterm price pressures would remain subdued owing to weak demand notably in the tourism and travelrelated sectors as well as to lower wage pressures and the appreciation of the euro
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9823638200759888;once the impact of the pandemic faded a recovery in demand supported by accommodative monetary and fiscal policies would put upward pressure on inflation over the medium term
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9935637712478638;marketbased indicators and surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations had remained broadly unchanged at low levels
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9621605277061462;it was observed that headline inflation was now expected to be in negative territory for longer than had been foreseen in the september ecb staff projections
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9766941070556641;moreover it was highlighted that hicp inflation excluding energy and food had fallen to a new low of 02 in september owing to lower nonenergy industrial goods and services inflation
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Negative;0.6566685438156128;at the same time there had also been a reduction in inflation in other items in the price index which was considered a cause for concern
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9953303337097168;it was pointed out that 35 of all items were currently posting negative growth rates and underlying price pressures were also weak raising concerns over a lasting impact
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9745069146156311;at the same time it was underlined in this context that it was important to stress the temporary nature of the current inflation dynamics partly owing to special factors such as exceptional patterns in seasonal sales and temporary tax reductions
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9867590069770813;moreover account should also be taken of changes in the consumption basket which implied that inflation might actually be slightly higher than reported
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9906576871871948;the impact of the latest developments in growth and inflation on the mediumterm outlook for inflation would have to be carefully evaluated in the december projections
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.5755736231803894;however the view was expressed that the probability that inflation rates would be closer to the severe scenario included in the september staff projections was increasing even if no additional negative surprises were to materialise
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9877718687057495;regarding recent developments in inflation expectations members noted that longerterm inflation expectations reported in the ecbs spf were stable at 17 while marketbased indicators of inflation expectations had declined slightly with the fiveyear forward inflationlinked swap rate five years ahead standing at 116
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.7921473979949951;it was pointed out that the spf survey round for the fourth quarter of 2020 had been conducted at the beginning of october before the resurgence of the pandemic and the widespread reintroduction of containment measures and the results therefore needed to be treated with caution
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8534964919090271;it was considered important to ensure that the protracted period of lower inflation in the short run did not lead to lower medium and longterm inflation expectations
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.975702166557312;with regard to the monetary analysis members broadly agreed with the assessment provided by mr lane in his introduction that broad money m3 growth continued to reflect domestic credit creation and the ongoing asset purchases by the eurosystem
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Positive;0.962159276008606;while monthly flows in loans to nonfinancial corporations had moderated in recent months amid a decline in emergency liquidity needs and subdued investment bank lending to the private sector continued to be supported by government guarantees and monetary policy particularly tltro iii which provided banks with sizeable funding cost relief
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9888226985931396;bank lending rates continued to stand near historical lows
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9738882780075073;tltro iii was seen to provide continuous support to bank lending as evidenced by the higher than expected takeup in the latest operation
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9914351105690002;the results of the euro area bank lending survey signalled a tightening of credit standards in the third quarter of 2020 mainly on account of the deterioration in banks perceptions of the risks to the macroeconomic environment and borrowers creditworthiness
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9770509600639343;according to the survey banks cost of funds and balance sheet situation had not contributed to the tightening underscoring the positive impact of monetary policy support on bank funding conditions
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9807254672050476;looking ahead banks reported that they expected a considerable net tightening of credit standards also in the fourth quarter of 2020 it was remarked however that the results of the bank lending survey should not be overinterpreted or overstated in view of the very substantial credit easing observed in the second quarter underpinned by stateguaranteed lending
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9243459701538086;moreover further fiscal and supervisory policy support might be forthcoming in the fourth quarter
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Negative;0.87318354845047;the point was made that heightened uncertainty surrounding the second wave of the pandemic and the associated containment measures could pose renewed risks to the transmission of monetary policy through the banking sector which required close monitoring
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9867521524429321;financial vulnerabilities in the corporate sector in particular could have negative ramifications for banks balance sheets and give rise to adverse realfinancial feedback loops
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9941798448562622;against this backdrop concerns were expressed about a likely increase in nonperforming loans and a heterogeneous impact of the pandemic on the banking sector across countries
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9949268102645874;it was noted that recent equity price developments suggested that markets might have started pricing in the adverse impact on the banking system of the resurgence in covid19 infections as evidenced by the underperformance of financial sector share prices
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9953479170799255;in this context it was recalled that low profitability in the banking sector and the erosion of net interest margins presented ongoing challenges for euro area banks
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9888519644737244;the view was expressed that fiscal initiatives to address nonperforming loans and ensure an adequately capitalised banking sector should be encouraged while monetary policy was playing its part in supporting favourable financing conditions and ample liquidity in the banking sector
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.989872932434082;monetary policy stance and policy considerations with regard to financial conditions members widely shared the assessments provided by ms schnabel and mr lane in their introductions
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Negative;0.8174158930778503;it was noted that euro area financial markets had been relatively calm with financial conditions  including exchange rate developments  being broadly stable and financing conditions for banks households and firms remaining very favourable
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9820160269737244;the relatively muted reaction of markets to the second wave of the pandemic was seen as evidence of the effectiveness of the ecbs monetary policy measures in containing tail risks including the risk of market fragmentation
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9904820919036865;at the same time markets were seen to remain fragile and could face a correction in pricing  for example in the event of a nodeal brexit a further worsening of the pandemic or if an agreement on the disbursement of funds under the ngeu plan was delayed
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9435951709747314;at the current juncture members viewed the monetary policy stance as highly accommodative and appropriate
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Negative;0.6498597264289856;it was stressed that monetary policy had to aim to preserve favourable financing conditions in the future in order to support economic activity
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9922852516174316;against this backdrop members supported the proposal by mr lane to leave the overall monetary policy stance unchanged and to reconfirm the full set of existing monetary policy instruments
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8626841902732849;furthermore members widely agreed that given the sharper slowdown in growth momentum and the weakening of underlying inflation dynamics compared with what had previously been expected as well as the deterioration in the balance of risks it would be warranted to recalibrate the monetary policy instruments in december
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9902002215385437;it was noted that taking monetary policy decisions in december would be consistent with prevailing market expectations
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9694887399673462;however it was also stressed that the governing council was in a position to act at any time if needed
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9299675822257996;at the same time it was underlined that more than half of the pepp envelope was still available to conduct ongoing purchases in a flexible manner in case of renewed market turbulence
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8934241533279419;by the time of the december meeting updated staff projections would be available and a clearer picture of the dynamics of the pandemic and prospects of a vaccine might have emerged together with more information on the fiscal policy responses in the euro area
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9374487996101379;with regard to the monetary policy measures taken since early march members widely agreed that they were helping to preserve favourable financing conditions for all sectors and jurisdictions across the euro area thereby providing crucial support to underpin economic activity and to safeguard mediumterm price stability
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Positive;0.5150399208068848;the tltros were seen to be providing funding to banks at favourable rates and contributing to low interest rates for bank lending and had so far successfully averted a credit crunch
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Positive;0.989976704120636;the pepp was proving successful in stabilising market conditions and reducing fragmentation as well as easing the monetary policy stance
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Positive;0.8783207535743713;it was remarked that the flexibility embedded in the pepp was essential to its continued success
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9742491841316223;while the existing monetary policy instruments were viewed as effective questions were raised about possible nonlinearities side effects and diminishing returns in an environment of high uncertainty and very favourable financial conditions
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9826734066009521;with markets having stabilised since the introduction of the pandemicrelated monetary policy measures in march it was noted that additional asset purchases might not have the same impact on financial conditions and real economic activity as they had had earlier in the year
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9877399802207947;it was emphasised that in the present environment monetary policy in part operated by facilitating fiscal expansion through keeping financing costs affordable and both policy domains were working hand in hand
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Negative;0.992668867111206;it also had to be acknowledged however that an accommodative monetary policy stance could create the temptation for governments to enter into commitments that were difficult to undo and thereby increase expenditure beyond what was necessary to deal with the pandemic exacerbating structural deficits and damaging the longterm sustainability of public finances
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.986299455165863;as regards communication members widely agreed with the proposals made by mr lane in his introduction
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9842117428779602;the governing council needed to signal that it stood ready to act with all the flexibility that was embodied in its pandemic emergency monetary policy tools while also stressing its determination to act and signalling its willingness to adjust all instruments if needed
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9850217700004578;it was stressed that any sign of complacency  even inadvertent  could be detrimental in the present circumstances
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9566042423248291;while there was wide agreement on the need to signal the necessity of recalibrating the ecbs monetary policy instruments at the december monetary policy meeting it was cautioned that the governing council should not precommit itself to specific policy actions
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.5522902011871338;in its communication the governing council needed to highlight that the downside risks to the baseline scenario of the september projections had clearly increased shifting the balance of risks further downwards and that the governing council was carefully evaluating the worsening of the pandemic and the associated intensification of government containment measures with regard to their implications for the nearterm outlook
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9905118346214294;therefore there was broad agreement that the governing council should communicate that on the basis of this updated assessment it would recalibrate its instruments as appropriate to ensure that financing conditions remained favourable to support the economic recovery counteracting the negative impact of the pandemic on the projected inflation path and thereby fostering the convergence of inflation towards the governing councils aim in a sustained manner in line with its commitment to symmetry
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Positive;0.6309511661529541;finally there was broad agreement among members to emphasise that an ambitious and coordinated fiscal stance remained critical and was the most effective policy in the current situation to deal with the effects of the pandemic and the associated containment measures
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8363496661186218;in its communication the governing council should strongly welcome the ngeu package and encourage the eu institutions to approve this package swiftly in order to activate it in a timely manner to support the regions and sectors hardest hit by the pandemic
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Negative;0.839182436466217;in this context it could be emphasised that monetary policy was removing obstacles to the expansion of fiscal policy by supporting favourable financing conditions and the proper functioning of financial markets
2020-11-26;2020;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9680726528167725;in this way fiscal and monetary policy reinforced each other in the current circumstances with monetary policy increasing its own effectiveness by empowering fiscal policy and fostering confidence
