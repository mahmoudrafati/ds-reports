2020-05-22;2020;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.957883894443512;members agreed that the outlook for headline inflation in the short term had to be revised down reflecting not only the reduction in oil prices but also the expectation of lower underlying inflation
2020-05-22;2020;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9877749681472778;it was argued that in 2020 the downward impact on prices of weaker demand would clearly be stronger than supplyside effects
2020-05-22;2020;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9063392281532288;however in an exchange of views about the likely impact of the pandemic on the outlook for price developments in the medium to long term it was emphasised that this would depend on a number of factors and could be considered more ambiguous with the overall net effect depending on the balance between increasing slack and lower aggregate demand and the possible longterm adverse impact on aggregate supply capacity
2020-05-22;2020;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9949935078620911;at the same time it was possible that the pandemic could have a prolonged negative effect on demand in which case the output gap might remain large putting downward pressure on prices for some time to come
2020-05-22;2020;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9938867688179016;a remark was made that the negative effect of the pandemic on the supply side of the economy and on potential growth might even not lead to upward price pressures but to further negative demand effects such as those associated with debt deflation
2020-05-22;2020;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9630662798881531;however it was also noted that inflation had in the past shown a high degree of persistence and there could be upward pressure on prices from the costs of containment measures and supply disruptions as well as from a number of structural effects following the pandemic
2020-05-22;2020;May;REPORT;Positive;0.7782860398292542;these were seen to include the exit of firms from the market and associated changes in the degree of competition lasting changes in supply chains and the location of production and increasing emphasis on resilience leading to higher buffers and inventories
2020-05-22;2020;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9751853942871094;there could also be tighter limits to production as the spatial distribution of global production changed
2020-05-22;2020;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9568896889686584;reference was also made in the discussion to the problem of measuring inflation accurately in the current circumstances taking into account changes in the composition of purchases of goods as well as the impaired ability to collect price data and uncertainty about how prices would be imputed in the absence of actual price data
2020-05-22;2020;May;REPORT;Negative;0.6319734454154968;all of this would make it more difficult to assess with any precision the situation with respect to inflation
2020-05-22;2020;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9876525402069092;in discussing recent developments in inflation expectations members noted that shortterm inflation expectations according to the ecbs survey of professional forecasters spf had been revised down sharply to stand at 04 for 2020 at the same time spf inflation expectations for 2021 and 2022 had been revised down by much less and surveybased longerterm inflation expectations had so far not been affected by the coronavirus crisis remaining at 17 for headline inflation

2020-05-22;2020;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9869958758354187;it was highlighted that since the start of the coronavirus pandemic the likelihood of inflation being below zero or below 1 according to optionimplied probabilities had increased substantially pointing to a significant risk of deflation or very low inflation in the coming years
2020-05-22;2020;May;REPORT;Positive;0.6698375940322876;with regard to the monetary analysis members broadly concurred with the assessment provided by mr lane in his introduction that the increase in broad money growth mostly reflected a rise in loans to nonfinancial corporations that was driven to a large extent by drawing on credit lines
2020-05-22;2020;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9869875907897949;these developments were also clearly visible in the results of the euro area bank lending survey for the first quarter of 2020 which indicated a surge in firms demand for loans and for drawing on credit lines to meet liquidity needs for working capital while financing needs for fixed investment had declined
2020-05-22;2020;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9931893348693848;the latest results of the bank lending survey also showed only a very mild net tightening of credit standards for firms whereas interim results from the survey on the access to finance of enterprises safe suggested that smes had registered a significant deterioration in their access to external finance owing to the unfavourable evolution of their own financial prospects
2020-05-22;2020;May;REPORT;Negative;0.8678494691848755;it was stressed that while increased lending was a welcome development it raised the level of riskweighted assets on banks balance sheets and lowered capital ratios which could induce banks to restrict lending eventually
2020-05-22;2020;May;REPORT;Positive;0.5663554072380066;in that context public loan guarantees were seen as a crucial element in maintaining credit flows to firms and households

2020-05-22;2020;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9336779713630676;the view was widely shared that the governing councils monetary policy measures taken in march and reinforced by decisions taken on the collateral framework in april had provided forceful monetary accommodation in a rapidly evolving environment and succeeded in safeguarding the ecbs monetary policy stance and effective monetary policy transmission across the euro area which included countering unwarranted increases in risk premia

2020-05-22;2020;May;REPORT;Negative;0.976931631565094;it was widely felt that the attractive pricing of tltro iii operations  in conjunction with government guarantees to banks  helped to provide incentives to maintain lending at a time when banks were facing challenges to reach their lending benchmarks and also counteracted pressures on bank lending rates resulting from recent increases in the euribor
2020-05-22;2020;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9131153225898743;at the same time a concern was expressed that lowering the minimum rate in the tltro iii operations to 50 basis points below the deposit facility rate could open up the possibility for banks to obtain funds in the tltro iii operations and then deposit them at the deposit facility rate instead of increasing their lending to the private sector
2020-05-22;2020;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.7927737832069397;members welcomed the proposal to conduct a new series of nontargeted longerterm refinancing operations to address the pandemic emergency
