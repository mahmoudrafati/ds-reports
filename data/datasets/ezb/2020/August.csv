2020-08-20;2020;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9894191026687622;as the pandemic was affecting economies sequentially and to different degrees this implied uneven recoveries and at the global level greater reliance on internal rather than external demand to support the recovery and on domestic rather than global value chains

2020-08-20;2020;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.8796613216400146;in their exchange of views members highlighted a number of factors in the shortterm inflation outlook
2020-08-20;2020;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9570000767707825;while oil price developments had led to a rebound in headline inflation it was still close to zero and almost 30 of the items in the hicp basket had posted negative inflation rates

2020-08-20;2020;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9821475744247437;current inflation developments also continued to be surrounded by uncertainty because the prices of some items in the hicp basket still needed to be imputed rather than collected
2020-08-20;2020;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9456326365470886;attention was also drawn to the possibility that the reduction in the german vat rate could temporarily push euro area headline inflation into negative territory and that such oneoff effects would require appropriate communication
2020-08-20;2020;August;REPORT;Negative;0.995754599571228;as regards inflation expectations marketbased indicators of longerterm expectations had continued to increase from the historical lows recorded in midmarch but overall remained at subdued levels

2020-08-20;2020;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9853830337524414;it was remarked that monetary transmission through the banking sector had been effective partly because the balance sheets of banks had been stronger at the start of the pandemic than before the financial crisis of 2008 the role of government guarantee schemes for loans was also highlighted as underpinning loan growth with some concern expressed about possible future cliff effects as such programmes expired
2020-08-20;2020;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9853197932243347;the results of the euro area bank lending survey indicated that banks expected a net tightening of credit standards on loans to firms in the third quarter of 2020 which signalled risks that the recent strong credit growth would not be sustained
2020-08-20;2020;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9928580522537231;concerns were voiced about the emergence of realfinancial feedback loops in particular in the interaction between nonfinancial corporations and banks notably if government guarantee schemes were withdrawn too early
2020-08-20;2020;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9945716261863708;it was also noted that credit standards for loans to households had tightened in the second quarter reflecting primarily a deterioration in households income and employment prospects in the context of the pandemic
2020-08-20;2020;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9797776937484741;at the same time it was argued that the expected net tightening of credit standards should not be overinterpreted against the background of the earlier considerable easing that had resulted from supportive policy measures
2020-08-20;2020;August;REPORT;Negative;0.979617178440094;it was seen as necessary to monitor the transmission of monetary policy carefully as the availability and cost of financing notably through the banking channel might become strained which could adversely affect household consumption and business investment
2020-08-20;2020;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9746667742729187;the point was made that the effects of the pandemic on corporate balance sheets would only become evident over time since the pandemic was not yet under control globally and its full effects had still to materialise

2020-08-20;2020;August;REPORT;Positive;0.9865434765815735;this improvement was considered to be especially noteworthy as it had taken place against the backdrop of a significant increase in fiscal deficits and rising public and private debt levels
2020-08-20;2020;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9807425737380981;at the same time the calmness of financial markets was considered to rest on the expected continuation of the supportive policy measures

2020-08-20;2020;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.7336279153823853;members agreed that a highly accommodative monetary policy stance continued to be appropriate on account of the subdued mediumterm outlook for price stability characterised by inflation expectations standing near historical lows and significant economic slack
2020-08-20;2020;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.5040335655212402;it was emphasised that the governing councils monetary policy had been effective in easing financial conditions from the tighter levels seen following the coronavirus shock and that part of the stimulus was still to be transmitted to the real economy over the coming months

2020-08-20;2020;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9904217720031738;the argument was also made that the flexibility of the pepp suggested that the net purchase envelope should be considered a ceiling rather than a target
2020-08-20;2020;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9804578423500061;the point was made that incoming data had surprised on the upside and some of the downside risks surrounding the outlook prevailing at the time of the governing councils june monetary policy meeting had receded increasing the possibility that the envelope might not have to be deployed fully
2020-08-20;2020;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.940444827079773;at the same time it was recalled that the pepp had been designed to achieve the dual objective of addressing risks to the smooth transmission of monetary policy across the euro area and risks to mediumterm price stability owing to the pandemic crisis
2020-08-20;2020;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9814673066139221;more specifically it aimed to offset the pandemicrelated downward shift in the projected path of inflation
2020-08-20;2020;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9900364875793457;accordingly under the baseline scenario in the june eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections and in the absence of any significant upside surprises to the mediumterm inflation outlook the current presumption was that the pepp envelope would have to be used in full
2020-08-20;2020;August;REPORT;Positive;0.9523729681968689;with regard to the tltro iii programme the point was made that the very strong takeup in the june 2020 operation was evidence of the programmes effectiveness in providing very favourable funding conditions for the banking sector while the passthrough to lending to the real economy was seen as calling for close monitoring
2020-08-20;2020;August;REPORT;Negative;0.7385520339012146;caution was seen as warranted given that government guarantee schemes appeared to be playing a key role in supporting bank lending at present as evidenced by the latest bank lending survey

2020-08-20;2020;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9862555265426636;at the same time it was cautioned that in terms of the flow of information over the summer it would be unusually difficult to extract signals about the mediumterm prospects for the economy and the inflation path as the scale of the initial bounceback in activity was not necessarily a good guide to the speed and robustness of the recovery
2020-08-20;2020;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9787010550498962;in any case at its september meeting the governing council would be in a better position to reassess the monetary policy stance and its policy tools

2020-08-20;2020;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9900370836257935;in this context it was argued that some of the uncertainties prevailing at the time of the governing councils june monetary policy meeting had receded while the balance of risks still remained on the downside
2020-08-20;2020;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.887752890586853;at the same time it was generally felt that communication should aim to strike a balance between acknowledging the improvements in incoming data and stressing the remaining risks
2020-08-20;2020;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9664109945297241;in this regard there was broad agreement to retain the present communication
