2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9365389943122864;against this background the pepp was a measure which was proportionate to counter the serious risks to price stability the monetary policy transmission mechanism and the economic outlook in the euro area which are posed by the outbreak and escalating diffusion of covid19 accordingly the downward revision to the inflation outlook together with the further downside risks captured in the severe scenario called for a temporary phase of additional asset purchases in order to deliver the monetary conditions that could support a return to the precrisis inflation trajectory within the projection horizon
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9699519276618958;in terms of timing the lags in the transmission of monetary policy to inflation dynamics meant that it was important to take a significant step in addressing the increase in the inflation shortfall
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Negative;0.8685413002967834;furthermore the value of a timely response was compounded by the importance of avoiding a sustained unanchoring of inflation expectations in view of the downside risks faced and the nearterm prospect of a sustained phase of very low inflation outcomes

2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Positive;0.5122580528259277;in terms of the overall monetary policy strategy purchases of government bonds under the pepp and the app were an effective tool for delivering on the treatyassigned price stability objective in the current environment
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.8140602111816406;this was especially the case given the already low levels of the ecbs policy rates and the crucial role of sovereign yields in determining the financing conditions of firms and households
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9905348420143127;these measures were also efficient especially in combination with other policy measures since other instruments would require extraordinary adjustment to generate the same impact on inflation dynamics

2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Positive;0.8996198773384094;it was seen as particularly important in the current environment that monetary policy and fiscal action should act as complements in combating the economic fallout from the pandemic crisis
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.7899053692817688;members broadly agreed with the arguments put forward by mr lane in his introduction that the pepp was the most effective and efficient tool for providing additional monetary accommodation in the current environment reflecting its dual role in supporting both the monetary policy stance and the transmission of the stance to all parts of the euro area economy in the current stressed market conditions
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Positive;0.5479216575622559;in terms of the overall stance and given the scale and unique nature of the pandemic shock the substantial downward shift in the inflation outlook would be better tackled through a targeted and temporary programme rather than a recalibration of the more standard policy tools
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9682098627090454;it was argued that the pepp was the best available instrument for lowering the medium and longterm interest rates which mattered most for the real economy
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9382124543190002;expanding the pepp would help to bring the sovereign bond yield curve more closely into line with the riskfree curve
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9903038144111633;this in turn would support the transmission of monetary policy to the interest rates applicable to households and businesses to the extent that sovereign bond yields acted as a benchmark for the pricing of loans and marketbased credit instruments
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9905367493629456;it was also remarked that increasing the size and duration of asset purchases would contribute to containing overall uncertainty thereby supporting the recovery of the euro area economy
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Positive;0.5428174138069153;in this vein the pepp could provide additional protection against the risks of fragmentation across market segments that might obstruct the smooth transmission of monetary policy
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Negative;0.982391893863678;it was recalled that the pepp had been rather successful in containing spread volatility in the european government bond markets and in averting risks of selffulfilling adverse market dynamics
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9751444458961487;in this context the importance of the flexible implementation of the pepp was emphasised as a means to ensure the transmission of monetary policy across time asset classes and jurisdictions
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.8237965106964111;such flexibility was seen as most effective and efficient during periods of market stress
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.99272620677948;at the same time it was reiterated that in line with the design features of the pepp the capital key remained the relevant benchmark for the allocation of purchases across jurisdictions
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9918190240859985;on this basis members broadly agreed with the proposal by mr lane to increase the size of the pepp by 600 billion to extend the horizon for net purchases under the pepp to at least the end of june 2021 and to announce that principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the pepp would be reinvested until at least the end of 2022 and that in any case the future rolloff of the pepp portfolio would be managed so as to avoid interference with the desired monetary policy stance
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9880877137184143;with regard to the calibration of the pepp expansion a range of preferences were expressed in favour of either a larger or smaller envelope
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9899307489395142;the case for a larger envelope was based on the significant downside risks to the june projections amid the exceptionally high degree of uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook together with the subdued inflation outlook with heightened risks of protracted disinflation or even deflation
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Positive;0.7246158123016357;in addition the point was made that the june projections did not cover the possibility that the crisis could spill over to the financial sector if this were to happen it would trigger a further deterioration in financial conditions and necessitate an even stronger monetary policy response
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9479935169219971;at the same time a number of arguments were made in favour of a smaller expansion of the pepp which would allow more time to assess the evolution of the economic situation and the mediumterm outlook for price stability
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Positive;0.7027997374534607;the point was also made that the june projections did not take into account the commissions recovery fund proposal or recently announced national fiscal measures which could entail an upside risk to the economic outlook contained in the staff projections
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9364204406738281;in the end a broad consensus emerged among members around the proposal put forward by mr lane to expand the pepp envelope by 600 billion in order to deliver the monetary conditions that could support a return to the precrisis inflation trajectory within the projection horizon
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9870105981826782;an expansion of this amount was seen as providing a clear signal that the governing council was not satisfied with the mediumterm inflation outlook of 13
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Positive;0.8817745447158813;it was also noted that expanding the size of the pepp by 600 billion would help support the smooth transmission across all jurisdictions of the euro area
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9882951974868774;with regard to the envisaged horizon of net purchases under the pepp members broadly concurred with the proposal put forward by mr lane to extend it until at least the end of june 2021 thus aligning it with the phase of the most severe impact of the pandemicrelated restrictions on economic activity and the weakest inflation pressures in the period ahead
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9937052130699158;the purchase horizon would also be broadly aligned with the horizons of the other monetary policy measures taken by the ecb in response to the pandemic
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9874638319015503;it was underlined that the proposed extension of the pepp was consistent with the governing councils communication that net asset purchases would continue until the coronavirus crisis phase was over
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Negative;0.97597336769104;the more prolonged economic slowdown than previously anticipated thus warranted such an extension
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9295755624771118;with regard to the reinvestment of principal payments members broadly agreed with the proposal made by mr lane to announce a pepp reinvestment horizon of until at least the end of 2022 this was seen to avoid the risk of an unwarranted tightening of financial conditions at a time when the recovery from the pandemic shock was likely to remain incomplete
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9634565711021423;these reinvestments were seen to enhance the effectiveness of the pepp by reducing the amount of duration risk that investors needed to absorb in the future thereby helping to limit upward pressure on longerterm interest rates
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9856005311012268;announcing a minimum duration for the reinvestment horizon of until at least the end of 2022 was viewed as appropriate given the temporary and emergency nature of the pepp
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9377695918083191;it was argued that this would also allow time in a manner that would not interfere with the broader monetary policy stance to reduce possible deviations from the capital key that might arise during the net purchase phase
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9881069660186768;members also put forward some broader considerations with regard to the effectiveness and efficiency of using asset purchases as a monetary policy tool in the pursuit of the ecbs price stability objective including in the light of the upcoming review of the monetary policy strategy and with a view to explaining the governing councils monetary policy deliberations in a more comprehensive way to the public
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9882036447525024;it was argued that the proportionality assessment of any monetary policy measure had to consider among other things the degree to which the measure contributed to achieving the monetary policy objective on the one hand and possible unintended side effects on the other hand
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9776712656021118;it required a judgement as to whether other policy measures were available that were as effective and efficient while offering a better balance between intended and unintended effects
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9891447424888611;it was highlighted that asset purchases were an essential tool with which monetary policy could affect macroeconomic developments and ultimately inflation outcomes via a number of transmission channels
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.964168131351471;from the outset purchases under the public sector purchase programme pspp of securities with maturities of between two and thirty years had been aimed at lowering market interest rates that are relevant for the real economy and inflation developments
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Positive;0.97371906042099;there was now ample evidence from an exhaustive literature showing that asset purchase programmes in general and the pspp in particular had proven effective in achieving their intended effects on the euro area economy and thereby in maintaining price stability
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Positive;0.98331218957901;asset purchases had lowered relevant market interest rates throughout the euro area which translated into lower bank lending rates and higher lending volumes and ultimately into higher growth and inflation outcomes
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Positive;0.8462373614311218;although the quantitative estimates varied to some extent and were subject to the usual model uncertainty the overall evidence underpinned the view that the pspp had had a positive impact on macroeconomic outcomes confirming the assessment that it was a policy measure that was effective in putting upward pressure on inflation and inflation expectations as intended
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Negative;0.8079321980476379;it was recalled that the decision to implement a largescale asset purchase programme in january 2015 had been taken in response to two major challenges namely strong disinflationary headwinds in the aftermath of the financial and sovereign debt crises in the euro area and the global phenomenon of declining equilibrium or natural interest rates that ultimately determined the degree of accommodation that a given level of policy rates would deliver
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9934329986572266;there was vast empirical evidence documenting the decline in the level of equilibrium interest rates over the past three decades which was broadly related to a decrease in potential output growth in many industrial countries reflecting factors such as demographic trends or low productivity growth
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9944835305213928;therefore with policy interest rates close to their effective lower bound unconventional instruments were needed to provide the degree of monetary accommodation that was consistent with the ecbs inflation aim
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9919164776802063;at the same time it was noted that the low interest rate environment in which central banks had to navigate was associated with a number of challenges
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9555211663246155;first low interest rates might incentivise market participants to adopt excessive risktaking behaviour ultimately triggering risks to financial stability
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9741345643997192;second low interest rates prevailing over an extended period of time could strain the profitability and hence the capitalisation of banks
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9933542013168335;third the low interest environment might give rise to scenarios in which banks financed inefficient firms which implied a misallocation of resources and could ultimately lead to a decrease in overall productivity in the economy
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9929487705230713;moreover low interest rates were also challenging for earnings on the savings of households and insurance companies that aimed for certain nominal yields
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.8474954962730408;it had to be acknowledged however that the asset purchases under the pspp had contributed to these potential issues but only to the extent that they lowered interest rates below the natural interest rate
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9646803140640259;hence the challenges of a low interest rate environment mainly arose from the structural factors driving the decline of interest rates while monetary policy had only contributed to these effects and was clearly not the main factor behind them
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9697110652923584;in assessing the benefits and costs of asset purchases the relevant benchmark was not the status quo but a counterfactual situation in which policy accommodation through asset purchases had not been provided
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Negative;0.6314645409584045;there was ample evidence that the euro area economy would have fared much worse without the policy stimulus from asset purchases
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9431625008583069;the eurosystems asset purchases had created financial conditions that countered disinflationary forces and helped to avert deflationary risks in the euro area
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9900394082069397;in overall macroeconomic terms asset purchases had made a very significant positive contribution to both economic growth and inflation in the euro area
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9909212589263916;with respect to the earnings situation of banks the low interest rate environment had reduced their interest rate margins but the positive impact of asset purchases on the broader economy had in turn supported banks balance sheets
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9359566569328308;in this context it was also highlighted that so far there was no convincing evidence that the low interest rates had contributed to socalled zombie lending
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Negative;0.7870169281959534;the empirical evidence on the effects of the low interest rate environment on retirement provisions was also unclear
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9689721465110779;in this context it was not only the nominal return on an individual asset that was relevant for overall retirement provisions but also the overall real return on all assets that people held in their portfolios over their lifetime
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.6495941877365112;as regards the impact of the ecbs monetary policy measures on households there was ample evidence from numerous studies on the impact of low interest rates and asset purchases on household income
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9702299237251282;evidence derived from the european household finance and consumption survey showed that net borrowers had benefited from lower interest rates whereas net savers had seen a decline in their interest income
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.989080548286438;it was also noted that the effects of lower interest rates arising from asset purchases were similar to the effects of using conventional monetary policy instruments
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9786432385444641;moreover to judge the overall effects of low interest rates on household income all transmission channels not just savings income had to be taken into account
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9889984726905823;the significant macroeconomic effects of asset purchases contributed to higher wages and higher employment and thereby positively affected households disposable income and consumption
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.6180094480514526;with regard to the potential interactions between monetary policy and fiscal policy a clear focus on the primary objective of maintaining price stability combined with safeguards which ensure the respect of the prohibition of monetary financing was viewed as essential to the lasting success and credibility of monetary policy and ultimately to acceptance and trust in the euro as a common currency
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9838129281997681;in order to ensure sustainable public finances the countries participating in the monetary union had adopted common budgetary rules and a budgetary surveillance procedure
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.845635175704956;moreover the institutional setup also relied on market discipline for sound fiscal policies while monetary policy needed to observe the prohibition of monetary financing
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9854776859283447;it was also recalled that the treaty on the functioning of the european union had not only granted the ecb independence assigned it the primary objective of price stability and prohibited monetary financing it also required the ecb to adhere to the principle of an open market economy with free competition
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.8711608052253723;against this background it was underlined that allocating the eurosystems purchases of public sector securities across jurisdictions using the ecbs capital key as the benchmark was one of the safeguards helping to maintain incentives for sound fiscal policies
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.988563060760498;moreover it was also regarded as important to set issue and issuer limits ensuring that member states continued to finance themselves primarily through the bond market
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9505468010902405;in this environment markets played an important disciplining role as bonds purchased in the primary market could not simply be passed on to the eurosystem
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9885819554328918;however the view was also expressed that if the eurosystem became the main holder of euro area government bonds this could weaken the disciplining role of markets and their incentives to assess the fiscal soundness of euro area sovereigns
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.8542783260345459;these aforementioned safeguards were supplemented by further operational constraints on the conduct of purchases criteria on the eligibility of sovereign issuers and a risksharing mechanism whereby the risks of the pspp holdings of national debt securities were borne by the respective national central banks
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9784131646156311;the point was also made that the combination of a very expansionary monetary policy with potentially unsound or unsustainable fiscal policies could undermine the foundation of a credible monetary policy
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9648519158363342;risks of fiscal dominance could arise in which monetary policy might be pressured to refrain from raising interest rates even if this was required to fulfil the monetary policy mandate
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9433687925338745;likewise with an increasing portfolio of public securities on the eurosystems balance sheet financial risks could increase which might  in adverse scenarios  hamper the effectiveness of monetary policy in the future
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9879128336906433;therefore it was viewed as essential to embed safeguards in the design of the eurosystems asset purchases including a limits framework and the capital key as a benchmark so as to mitigate the risk of monetary policy becoming dependent on countries fiscal policies
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9803076386451721;accordingly these should constitute guiding principles
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9900968074798584;a remark was also made that in some situations in which misguided fiscal and structural policies threatened the transmission of monetary policy and the achievement of the ecbs price stability objective the governing council also had other tools that could be activated in conjunction with an adjustment programme by the european stability mechanism
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Positive;0.8668810129165649;overall there was broad agreement among members that while different weights might be attached to the benefits and side effects of asset purchases the negative side effects had so far been clearly outweighed by the positive effects of asset purchases on the economy in the pursuit of price stability
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9408923983573914;however it was also noted that it could not be ruled out that unintended effects could increase over time and eventually outweigh the overall positive effects
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9688255786895752;it was thus seen as important to continuously assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the monetary policy measures their transmission channels and their benefits and costs
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9498862624168396;in this context it was remarked that all expansionary monetary policy instruments contributed to a low interest rate environment
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.990019679069519;therefore the associated side effects of low rates were not a distinguishing feature of asset purchases such as under the pspp or the pepp but were a factor pertaining to all policy instruments that contributed to a low interest rate environment

2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Negative;0.7483789920806885;members also agreed to emphasise in the communication that two main factors called for further policy action first the pandemicrelated downward revision to the inflation outlook on the back of lower energy prices and a significant increase in economic slack which posed a threat to the governing councils mediumterm price stability objective and second the unwarranted tightening of financial conditions in an economic environment that instead required easier financial conditions
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Positive;0.8624285459518433;accordingly it had to be stressed that additional monetary policy action was needed to ensure the necessary degree of monetary accommodation and a smooth transmission of monetary policy across sectors and jurisdictions in order to support the swift recovery of economic activity to precoronavirus levels and to safeguard mediumterm price stability
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.8748015761375427;in this regard recalibrating the pepp was the most appropriate course of action as expanding the pepp and extending its horizon would be most effective for further easing the general monetary policy stance maintaining favourable funding costs for the real economy and providing temporary support in response to the pandemicrelated shock to the euro area economy and the path of inflation
2020-06-25;2020;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.8644411563873291;in addition it had to be stressed that conducting purchases in a flexible manner over time across asset classes and among jurisdictions allowed the governing council to effectively stave off risks to the smooth transmission of monetary policy
