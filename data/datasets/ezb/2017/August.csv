2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.6889331340789795;reference was made to the speech by the president at the ecb forum on central banking in sintra in which he outlined a number of explanatory factors such as external price shocks more slack in the labour market and lags in the process of wage and price formation
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9856351613998413;looking ahead it was considered important to monitor the extent to which such factors would be transient or more permanent
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.7912794947624207;a number of factors were likely to be of a more structural nature
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.4744246006011963;these included changes in labour markets work contracts and wagesetting processes benefiting from the reforms introduced in previous years which could imply a structural break in the phillips curve
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9923434853553772;at the same time labour market slack was still considerable when assessed on the basis of broader unemployment measures and a large supply of lowskilled labour could continue to dampen wage dynamics in the near term
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Negative;0.5872659087181091;the reaction of wages to improving economic conditions could also come with some delay owing to the backwardlooking component of wage and price formation and staggered wagesetting
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9895545244216919;in goods and services markets digitisation might put downward pressure on prices over a protracted period
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9913213849067688;finally the relatively slow pace of deleveraging in the euro area could contribute to a delayed adjustment in prices
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9828435182571411;various arguments nevertheless suggested that cost pressures could gradually increase as the economic expansion continued
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9737946391105652;while labour market slack was still significant it was following a clear downward path which should ultimately translate into higher wage growth and firms were signalling an emerging labour shortage in a number of skill categories
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Negative;0.8845191597938538;furthermore nonwage components of labour costs could increase owing to a shift in focus in wage negotiations in a number of countries
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Negative;0.4936384856700897;overall while members considered that the ongoing economic expansion gave reason for confidence that inflation dynamics would strengthen over time they emphasised that patience persistence and prudence were needed as this process was expected to take time and remained contingent on a very substantial degree of monetary policy accommodation
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9847127199172974;with regard to the monetary analysis members concurred with the assessment presented by mr praet in his introduction
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Positive;0.9889912605285645;broad money m3 had continued to expand at a robust pace
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Positive;0.9801382422447205;as in previous months annual growth in m3 had reflected growth mainly in its most liquid components while the gradual recovery in loan growth to the private sector visible since the start of 2014 was proceeding
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9142650961875916;market financing and bank borrowing costs for firms and households had remained very favourable and supportive of euro area credit flows and credit conditions had loosened further
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Positive;0.9897165894508362;reference was made to the latest bank lending survey which indicated that banks access to retail and wholesale funding had improved in the second quarter of 2017 moreover loan growth had continued to be supported by increased demand across all categories and by easing credit standards on loans to enterprises and loans to households for house purchase
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Positive;0.7381023168563843;looking ahead banks were expecting a further net easing of credit standards for all loan categories in the third quarter of 2017 all of this suggested that the passthrough of the policy measures was continuing including from the targeted longerterm refinancing operations which banks continued to report as contributing to an easing of credit terms and conditions
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.8662035465240479;overall credit conditions continued to be assessed as being favourable and supporting the economic expansion thereby contributing to the return of inflation to the governing councils mediumterm inflation aim
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9487379193305969;nonetheless as on previous occasions the observation was made that despite the recovery in credit to the private sector credit dynamics remained modest overall
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9097864031791687;in this regard it was noted that m3 growth continued to depend to a considerable extent on the ecbs monetary policy measures although monetary dynamics were becoming more selfsustaining over time with the contribution of credit to the private sector gradually increasing
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Positive;0.8386678099632263;monetary policy stance and policy considerations with regard to the monetary policy stance members widely shared the assessment provided by mr praet in his introduction that the growth outlook had become more favourable increasing confidence that inflation would gradually converge to levels in line with the governing councils inflation aim
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Positive;0.6769198775291443;the ecbs monetary policy measures had substantially reduced financing costs to historically low levels across the euro area
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Positive;0.9544926285743713;the passthrough of the measures was continuing and a prolonged period of growth above potential implied a progressive closing of the output gap and the reabsorption of labour market slack supporting a gradual rise in inflation over time
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Positive;0.8497951030731201;the governing council could thus be confident in the continued effectiveness of the monetary policy measures
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9487619996070862;while positive supply shocks or the legacy of the financial crisis could delay the transmission of the ecbs monetary policy to prices these factors were ultimately of a temporary nature
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9952723383903503;at the same time it was cautioned that inflation dynamics remained subdued and that there continued to be considerable uncertainty about the inflation outlook and the speed with which inflation was converging towards the governing councils inflation aim
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Negative;0.723347008228302;measures of underlying inflation while showing some tentative signs of a pickup still needed to show conclusive evidence of a sustained upward trend
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Negative;0.37423479557037354;therefore a very substantial degree of monetary accommodation was still needed for underlying inflation pressures to build up gradually and support headline inflation developments in the medium term
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Positive;0.8457843661308289;patience was still warranted for reflationary forces to translate into stronger inflation dynamics
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9383739233016968;at the same time it was noted that the recent volatility in euro area hicp inflation which had been largely due to energy price developments underlined the need to look through changes in headline inflation that were transient and carried no implication for the outlook for price stability over the medium term
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9273771643638611;to this end it was important to ensure that inflation expectations remained well anchored
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Positive;0.989927351474762;there was also broad agreement with the assessment provided by mr praet that euro area financial conditions had despite a repricing across financial markets remained broadly supportive of the continued economic expansion
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Positive;0.9399260878562927;despite the flattening of the yield curve in the united states financial conditions had tightened since the governing councils previous monetary policy meeting in early june mainly owing to an appreciation of the euro and an upward shift in bond market yields which had also been reflected in a rise in real interest rates
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Positive;0.9906309247016907;the point was made that the prevailing financial conditions mostly reflected the improved macroeconomic conditions and fundamentals in the euro area
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Negative;0.970819890499115;moreover it was underlined that the broader financing conditions relevant for households and firms including bank lending rates and credit conditions remained very favourable across the euro area
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Positive;0.9424705505371094;in addition sovereign and corporate bond spreads had been notably resilient to the repricing of the riskfree curve and had in fact tightened somewhat which also suggested that the repricing had been largely related to positive macroeconomic news
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9928064346313477;at the same time concerns were expressed about a possible overshooting in the repricing by financial markets notably the foreign exchange markets in the future
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9652633666992188;it was underlined that the still favourable financing conditions could not be taken for granted and relied to a considerable extent on a continued high degree of monetary policy accommodation
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9818238615989685;such favourable financing conditions were providing significant support to the upturn in the euro area economy and continued to be seen as necessary for inflation to rise towards the governing councils inflation aim
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9309782981872559;taking all these considerations into account members generally agreed that from the present perspective the available evidence continued to indicate that convincing progress on a durable and selfsustaining convergence of inflation to the governing councils mediumterm inflation aim had still to be secured
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Negative;0.5545267462730408;although inflation was gradually moving towards this aim and confidence in this movement was increasing overall convincing signs of a more dynamic pickup in measures of underlying inflation were yet to appear
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Positive;0.8361672759056091;moreover the baseline scenario for inflation remained crucially conditional on the very easy financing conditions that largely depended on the current accommodative monetary policy stance
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.648296058177948;against this background there was broad agreement among members that there was presently a continuing need for steadyhanded and persistent monetary policy
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9871063232421875;the current monetary policy stance remained appropriate
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9912042021751404;this included keeping in place all elements of the governing councils forward guidance on its key interest rates and the intended pace of monthly net asset purchases
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9946739673614502;more generally the point was again made that the overall degree of accommodation was determined by the combination of all the monetary policy measures implemented by the ecb and that the governing councils assessment of progress regarding a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation should apply to the overall design and direction of the ecbs monetary policy stance as a whole and not with reference to any particular instrument in isolation such as the duration and pace of app asset purchases
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9880131483078003;at the same time it was underscored that the asset purchase programme would continue to be a key instrument if the governing council assessed the sustained adjustment of inflation to be at risk while the use of other instruments within the ecbs mandate could not be ruled out
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9815548062324524;in this context it was also suggested that the stock versus flow effects of asset purchases be considered
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9895222783088684;the case was made for proceeding gradually and prudently when approaching adjustments in the monetary policy stance and communication in line with the governing councils evolving assessment
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Negative;0.8438646793365479;caution was expressed that in the present financial market environment markets were particularly sensitive to incoming information
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Positive;0.9873277544975281;on the one hand the improving economic environment could be expected to have an impact on forwardlooking financial variables
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Negative;0.972719132900238;on the other hand there was a risk that financial conditions could tighten to a degree that was not warranted by the improvement in economic conditions and the outlook for inflation
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.951067328453064;in this context the point was made that looking ahead the governing council needed to gain more policy space and flexibility to adjust policy and the degree of monetary policy accommodation if and when needed in either direction
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Negative;0.8673960566520691;a suggestion was made that some consideration be given to an incremental adjustment in the language on forward guidance because postponing an adjustment for too long could give rise to a misalignment between the governing councils communication and its assessment of the state of the economy which could trigger more pronounced volatility in financial markets when communication eventually had to shift
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9612972140312195;however it was generally judged paramount at this stage to avoid sending signals that could be prone to overinterpretation and might prove premature
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9862128496170044;accordingly there was agreement among all members to retain all elements of forward guidance as proposed by mr praet
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9903343319892883;the governing council would in the autumn consider the future course of its monetary policy and in particular its strategy for asset purchases beyond the currently communicated horizon
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.986920952796936;monetary policy decisions and communication as regards communication all members agreed with the proposals put forward by mr praet in his introduction
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.8243414163589478;it was thus seen as important to stress that the economic expansion had strengthened and that risks to the growth outlook were broadly balanced
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Positive;0.9744917154312134;moreover it was seen as appropriate to emphasise that the governing councils confidence that inflation would gradually converge towards its aim had been strengthened by the ongoing economic expansion
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Positive;0.9830758571624756;however while reflationary forces which referred to the recovery of inflation from levels below its longterm trend had replaced risks of deflation the economic expansion had yet to translate into stronger inflation dynamics
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.590559184551239;in the light of the heightened sensitivity of financial markets to news a steady approach to communication was seen as key
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Negative;0.8000770807266235;the governing council needed to strike a fine balance between on the one hand expressing justified confidence in the economic expansion and on the other hand underlining the need for monetary policy to remain persistent and patient
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.5963969826698303;it was thus important to stress that a very substantial degree of monetary accommodation was still needed for underlying inflation pressures to build up gradually supporting headline inflation in the medium term and for inflation dynamics to become more durable and selfsustaining
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9771589636802673;against this background the governing council should also reiterate its continued readiness to adjust the size andor duration of the asset purchases if necessary
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9830522537231445;the view was widely shared that prudence was warranted with regard to the governing councils communication on the possible timing of its deliberations on the future course of its monetary policy
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9869628548622131;overall members agreed that communication on the timing of the decision should refer to the autumn
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9917299151420593;taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members on a proposal from the president the governing council decided to keep the interest rates on the eurosystems main refinancing operations the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility unchanged at 000 025 and 040 respectively
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.986552894115448;the governing council expected the key ecb interest rates to remain at their present levels for an extended period of time and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9940980672836304;with regard to nonstandard monetary policy measures the governing council confirmed that the net asset purchases at the current monthly pace of 60 billion were intended to run until the end of december 2017 or beyond if necessary and in any case until the governing council saw a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9750915169715881;the net purchases would be made alongside reinvestments of the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme
2017-08-17;2017;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9530142545700073;if the outlook became less favourable or if financial conditions became inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation the governing council stood ready to increase the programme in terms of size andor duration
