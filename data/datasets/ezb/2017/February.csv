2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.980776846408844;marketbased measures of inflation expectations had also recovered while remaining below surveybased measures
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9204719662666321;in this regard measurement uncertainties were recalled stemming from the impact of risk premia which could not be readily disentangled from the expectations component
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Positive;0.798434317111969;global financial market developments especially spillovers from us bond markets had also played a large role in recent developments
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9891273379325867;in addition reference was made to the price of deflation protection which had continued to fall and now suggested that a scenario of deflation was no longer on the radar of market participants while the price of inflation protection had increased slightly remaining at very low levels
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8811252117156982;with regard to possible downside or upside risks to the mediumterm price outlook members noted that recent increases in energy prices had thus far not translated into indirect or secondround effects on broader inflation while it was also argued that based on past evidence such effects might materialise with a considerable lag
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9654880166053772;looking ahead indirect and secondround effects of headline inflation on underlying inflation would need to be monitored carefully
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9491633772850037;indirect effects could arise for those sectors that depended heavily on energy such as those subject to increases in transportation costs
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9637840986251831;as for possible secondround effects a number of factors shaping wage dynamics merited continued monitoring and further analysis
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9502346515655518;first it was recalled that the wage formation process was to a large extent backwardlooking in a number of euro area countries
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.7368325591087341;second the wagesetting calendar could have a significant impact on wage dynamics looking ahead
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9812440276145935;however it was also pointed out that wage agreements were staggered over time and often had a multiyear horizon
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8902135491371155;this suggested that any secondround effects would unfold rather slowly
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Negative;0.5008175373077393;third labour market reforms and changes in wagesetting processes including a move towards more decentralised wage bargaining in some countries could affect the shape of the phillips curve
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.7028074860572815;fourth future wage dynamics would depend on the degree of labour market slack which was difficult to measure
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9913022518157959;fifth it was seen as worthwhile to examine in more detail wage developments across euro area countries including unit labour costs where some divergence in wage growth was to be expected and was necessary for a further rebalancing of competitiveness within the euro area
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9878316521644592;over the medium term headline and underlying inflation were expected to rise gradually supported by the governing councils monetary policy measures and the continued economic recovery
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9067868590354919;overall both downside and upside risks to the inflation outlook were seen to warrant close monitoring
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9847127199172974;with regard to the monetary analysis members concurred with the assessment presented by mr praet in his introduction
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9878250956535339;broad money m3 had again expanded at a robust pace in november 2016 supported by its most liquid components as in previous months
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9453487396240234;loan dynamics had proceeded on the path of gradual recovery observed since the beginning of 2014 with loan growth to both nfcs and households increasing in november
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9893661737442017;members observed that the monetary policy measures put in place since june 2014 reinforced by the december 2016 decisions were continuing to pass through effectively to borrowing conditions for firms and households and to credit creation
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Positive;0.6721698045730591;the continued improvements in credit markets notably in bank loan provision and corporate debt markets were visible in a broad range of indicators including the results of the euro area bank lending survey for the fourth quarter of 2016 more generally it was underlined that the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission to credit developments depended crucially on the underlying strength of balance sheets in the financial and nonfinancial sectors and the adjustment progress made
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9508882761001587;in particular adequate capital buffers and the resolution of nonperforming loans in the banking sector were seen as prerequisites to further support credit creation
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9904261231422424;likewise continued progress in deleveraging by nfcs could further support loan demand looking ahead
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9903113842010498;monetary policy stance and policy considerations with regard to the monetary policy stance members widely shared the assessment provided by mr praet in his introduction that while inflation had increased lately largely owing to base effects in energy prices underlying inflation pressures had remained subdued and signs of a convincing upward trend were still lacking
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9864686727523804;it was broadly agreed that a very substantial degree of monetary accommodation continued to be needed for euro area inflation pressures to build up and to secure a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels below but close to 2 over the medium term
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Positive;0.7862462401390076;members expressed satisfaction about how financial markets had received the december 2016 policy announcements demonstrating that the underlying rationale of the apps recalibration and the guidance provided in the governing councils communication had been well understood by market participants
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Positive;0.7988924980163574;the decisions taken in december had succeeded in preserving the very favourable financing conditions that were necessary to secure a sustained convergence of inflation rates towards levels below but close to 2 over the medium term
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9895060658454895;financial conditions had overall recorded some broadbased improvement since the december monetary policy meeting and borrowing conditions for firms and households were continuing to benefit from the passthrough of the policy measures
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9500763416290283;while more time was needed for the policy measures to fully unfold their effects on the euro area economy and ultimately on inflation outcomes  also considering that in the presence of ongoing balance sheet adjustments transmission lags were likely to be longer than usual  it was stressed that the measures were increasingly bearing fruit in terms of rising confidence employment gains and a broadening of the recovery
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Negative;0.46792158484458923;moreover the accommodative monetary policy stance appeared to be increasingly visible in developments in inflation expectations which had shown signs of a reversal from previous flat or negative trends while also reflecting changes in the global environment
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Negative;0.7778939008712769;members agreed on the appropriateness of the current monetary policy stance and recent developments were generally seen to vindicate the decisions taken by the governing council at its meeting in early december 2016 while there had been some positive news since that meeting the fundamental picture remained largely unaltered and there was no room for complacency as risks and uncertainties had not receded substantially notably those related to the political environment at the global level and within the euro area
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Negative;0.7605655789375305;moreover the recent pickup in inflation had been mainly driven by an increase in energy prices and hence it was premature to draw conclusions as to the possible implications of these recent developments for the mediumterm outlook for inflation
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9770395755767822;the view was widely shared that there was as yet insufficient progress towards a durable and selfsustaining convergence in the path of inflation consistent with the governing councils inflation aim
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9763064980506897;underlying inflation dynamics had remained subdued and the scenario of an upward trend in inflation still depended crucially on the prevailing very favourable financing conditions which to a large extent reflected the current accommodative monetary policy stance
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9915177226066589;in this context it was recalled that in line with the governing councils monetary policy strategy and past communication monetary policy had to be forwardlooking and oriented to the medium term meaning that the governing council would look through the volatility in shortterm data if judged transient and to have no implication for the mediumterm outlook for price stability
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9921878576278687;therefore there was broad agreement to look through recent upturns in headline inflation driven by energy prices while carefully monitoring potential indirect and secondround effects
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9928010702133179;this was seen to be fully consistent with the governing councils past decisions and established approach to treating temporary changes in inflation on the upside and on the downside
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.713523268699646;against this background it was widely agreed that it was imperative to maintain a very substantial degree of monetary accommodation for inflation pressures to build up and durably support headline inflation
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Negative;0.544357419013977;otherwise recent encouraging developments in inflation expectations and the prospects for a sustained adjustment in inflation towards the governing councils inflation aim could be put at risk
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Negative;0.5042201280593872;therefore the governing council was seen as well advised to remain patient and maintain a steady hand to provide stability and predictability in an environment that was still characterised by a high level of uncertainty
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.573693573474884;at the same time the point was made that the window of opportunity provided by a prolonged period of favourable monetary and financial conditions needed to be used by other policy areas to bolster sustained growth namely by speeding up structural reforms
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9882403612136841;looking ahead incoming information had to be monitored carefully while more time was needed to better assess the recent uptick in inflation and the extent to which energy price developments were passing through to underlying inflation and affecting the mediumterm outlook for price developments
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9481219053268433;members considered the implementation of the app to be proceeding smoothly following the decisions taken in december to expand the universe of eligible assets
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9538294672966003;it was however noted that repo rates had recorded a rather pronounced decline over the yearend especially in some jurisdictions despite the enhancements made to the eurosystems securities lending facilities
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.906102180480957;this suggested that these developments were driven by a number of special factors
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Negative;0.4757819175720215;moreover in addition to the impact of the app there were also several structural factors boosting the demand for highquality collateral including market trends and regulatory changes
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Positive;0.8423458933830261;it was highlighted that the enhancements to the securities lending programme had been welcomed by market participants as overall use of the programme and especially of the cash collateral option had increased mitigating collateral scarcity around the end of the year
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9795249700546265;against that background the governing council should carefully monitor market developments and the use of the securities lending facilities and stand ready to make further adaptations if needed
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9926275610923767;regarding the implementation details on the governing councils december decision to permit asset purchases below the dfr to the extent necessary the choices outlined by mr cœuré were seen to primarily hinge on the relative weights to be given to the different criteria and restrictions attached to the app
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9680219292640686;it was recalled that sticking to the issue and issuer limits had been assessed as most important in this regard
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9493127465248108;while significant weight was also placed on limiting deviations from the ecbs capital key it was also underlined that limited and temporary deviations were possible and inevitable
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8888848423957825;thus there was some room for a tradeoff between relative deviations from the capital key across jurisdictions and limiting the extent of purchases below the dfr
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9926642179489136;all in all broad support was expressed by members for the way forward indicated by mr cœuré whereby pspp purchases below the dfr should in the first instance be guided by the application of the capital key across jurisdictions subject to purchasability constraints
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9828583002090454;this baseline approach could be reconsidered by the governing council should undue market effects materialise
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9868870377540588;at the same time it was agreed that under the pspp priority should be given to purchases of assets with yields above the dfr thereby limiting the amount of purchases below the dfr if not required to achieve the envisaged amounts for each jurisdiction
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9930659532546997;monetary policy decisions and communication as regards communication members widely agreed to maintain the communication adopted at the december monetary policy meeting and hence to confirm the intended pace and horizon of app purchases and the forward guidance on the key policy rates as had been suggested by mr praet in his introduction
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9947620034217834;this implied reiterating that asset purchases under the app would continue at the current monthly pace of 80 billion until the end of march 2017 and were intended to continue at a monthly pace of 60 billion from april 2017 until the end of the year and in any case until the governing council saw a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9888478517532349;while it had to be acknowledged that both inflation and growth developments were moving in the right direction uncertainties had not receded
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9770427942276001;therefore the governing council should also continue to signal its willingness and readiness to act if warranted to achieve its price stability objective
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9784843325614929;this included in particular its preparedness to adjust the purchase programme in terms of size andor duration should the outlook become less favourable or should financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9881159067153931;finally it was felt that a strong call should be made for other policymakers to step up their efforts in support of the euro area recovery and the prospects for sustained growth in the euro area
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Negative;0.8835248351097107;the presence of an accommodative monetary policy stance and the firming recovery provided euro area governments with a favourable environment to engage decisively in structural reforms to boost investment reduce structural unemployment and increase potential output
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9917299151420593;taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members on a proposal from the president the governing council decided to keep the interest rates on the eurosystems main refinancing operations the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility unchanged at 000 025 and 040 respectively
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9254857897758484;the governing council continued to expect the key ecb interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9928218722343445;regarding nonstandard monetary policy measures the governing council confirmed that it would continue to make purchases under the app at the current monthly pace of 80 billion until the end of march 2017 and that from april 2017 the net asset purchases were intended to continue at a monthly pace of 60 billion until the end of december 2017 or beyond if necessary and in any case until the governing council saw a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9264283776283264;the governing council reiterated its preparedness to increase the purchase programme in terms of size andor duration should the outlook become less favourable or should financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9937378168106079;regarding further details on how the eurosystem would buy assets with yields below the dfr under the app the governing council decided that purchases below the dfr would be conducted only under the pspp and for each jurisdiction priority would be given to purchases of assets with yields above the dfr
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9921965599060059;this implied that the amount of purchases that had to be made at yields below the dfr would vary among jurisdictions
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9882396459579468;this amount might also change over time reflecting changes in market interest rates relative to the dfr
2017-02-16;2017;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9883117079734802;the members of the governing council subsequently finalised the draft introductory statement which the president and the vicepresident would as usual deliver at the press conference following the end of the current governing council meeting
