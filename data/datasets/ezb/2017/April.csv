2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9628201127052307;account of the monetary policy meeting of the governing council of the european central bank held in frankfurt am main on wednesday and thursday 89 march 2017 6 april 2017 1 review of financial economic and monetary developments and policy options financial market developments mr cœuré reviewed the latest financial market developments
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8716525435447693;since the governing councils previous monetary policy meeting on 1819 january 2017 two key developments had taken place
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.939569890499115;first financial markets had significantly repriced monetary policy expectations in the united states
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Negative;0.7339887619018555;second events in the euro area had impacted both the short and the long end of the yield curve
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9838116765022278;in the united states financial markets had significantly repriced expectations of an interest rate hike by the federal open market committee fomc in march 2017 the probability of a march hike as implied by the fed funds futures market on 8 march stood at 96 compared with 15 at the time of the governing councils january monetary policy meeting
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9703337550163269;as a consequence market expectations of the future path of us rates had moved closer towards the forecasts of the median of fomc members for 2017 which predicted three hikes in 2017 while longerterm rate expectations were largely unchanged
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.6734719276428223;separately on the fiscal side market participants had scaled down their expectations regarding stimulus from the new us administrations fiscal measures and appeared rather to be in a waitandsee mode
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.981361448764801;turning to the euro area since the governing councils previous monetary policy meeting the aggregate synthetic euro area yield curve for central government bonds and the yield curve for aaarated central government bonds had evolved differently
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9910405278205872;the former had steepened due to an increase in yields at the long end of the curve whereas the short end of the curve was broadly unchanged
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9404982924461365;the latter had steepened due to a decrease at the short end whereas the increase at the long end had been more muted
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.5905687808990479;mr cœuré highlighted some of the factors driving these developments
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.850527822971344;one factor was related to safehaven flows
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9871070981025696;faced with a series of political surprises last year including the outcomes of the uk referendum on eu membership and the us presidential elections market participants appeared to have become more sensitive to political tail risk events
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Negative;0.8943367600440979;this uncertainty had led to increased safehaven flows in particular into german shortterm government bonds which had pushed yields down at the short end of the german curve while widening longterm spreads in some other jurisdictions
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9146124720573425;another factor related to the availability of bonds
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Negative;0.947118878364563;flight to quality and generally demand for safe assets had exacerbated the scarcity of shortterm safe bonds available to private investors
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Positive;0.4046330451965332;bearing in mind that shortterm yields of some highly rated euro area jurisdictions had been gradually decoupling from equivalent overnight index swap ois rates for some time this implied a sustained demand particularly for german shortterm bonds linked to a generally higher need for safe collateral in an environment in which issuance had been shifting from shortterm to longterm bonds
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.6266196966171265;beyond regulatory reasons that could explain this development as shown by acute endmonth and endquarter tensions other elements might come into play in particular the demand for safe assets by investors with no access to the ecbs deposit facility namely nonbank investors such as asset managers and central counterparties which had to invest their liquidity
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9825018644332886;in addition noneuro area investors with no access to the deposit facility either had to buy bonds to keep liquidity in euro
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9903298616409302;these elements might have added to the downward pressure on german bond yields
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9917248487472534;moreover since investors now expected higher yields in the united states there may have been a general reluctance by private investors to take duration risk which further added to the demand for shortterm bonds
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Negative;0.7382215857505798;money therefore remained parked at the short end of the curve and was not moving to the longer end which itself contributed to a further steepening of the curve
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Negative;0.985454797744751;although more tentative a third factor related to lower bond market liquidity which may have amplified the widening of sovereign spreads in some jurisdictions against the background of a reduced capacity of bond dealers to cushion volatility shocks
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Negative;0.8047400712966919;a fourth factor was the eurosystems ongoing asset purchases now also including securities with yields below the deposit facility rate which in conjunction with market participants expectations of the future availability of bonds might have contributed to the decline in rates at the front end of the curve in some jurisdictions in the weeks before the meeting
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8619617819786072;mr cœuré then highlighted that the repo market had remained fairly stable over recent weeks
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9588200449943542;for instance the decline in the twoyear german bond yield on the cash bond market had not been matched by a similar development in the repo market
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Negative;0.5814359784126282;also money market rates and general collateral repo rates had been relatively stable and continued to be mostly driven by structural factors  such as supply and demand imbalances in the collateral market  and to a lesser extent by shortterm volatility and political uncertainty
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Positive;0.7072280645370483;the eurosystem cash collateral facility had been instrumental in mitigating pressures in the repo market
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Positive;0.988918125629425;the high level of excess liquidity together with regulation had also played a positive role in preventing a larger spillover of the tensions on the bond market to shortterm funding markets
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9548704028129578;as euro area banks liquidity buffers were generally ample their shortterm borrowing needs remained limited preventing an abrupt increase in the cost of unsecured borrowing
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.991349458694458;mr cœuré recalled that marketimplied inflation expectations had remained broadly unchanged since the governing councils january monetary policy meeting and maintained their close correlation with spot energy prices in the euro area

2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9602776169776917;turning to the euro area incoming information notably sentiment indicators continued to point to a firming and broadening of the recovery
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9895749688148499;real gdp had increased by 04 quarter on quarter in the fourth quarter of 2016 after 04 in the third quarter and 03 in the second mainly driven by domestic demand on the back of sustained employment gains and higher labour income
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9846010804176331;the unemployment rate had decreased further from the fourth quarter of 2016 to 96 in january 2017 private consumption had continued to increase in the fourth quarter and the cyclical recovery in business investment proceeded benefiting from the prevailing very favourable financing conditions
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.992606520652771;euro area export dynamics in december 2016 had been broadly in line with developments in global trade

2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9719141125679016;the gradual recovery in loan growth had continued and was becoming more widespread across euro area countries although differences persisted

2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9646620750427246;finally the fiscal stance in the euro area as measured by the change in the cyclically adjusted primary balance was estimated to have been slightly less expansionary in 2016 compared with the assessment at the january monetary policy meeting
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9882611632347107;the fiscal stance continued to be seen as broadly neutral over the remainder of the projection horizon
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Negative;0.577100396156311;monetary policy considerations and policy options summing up mr praet concluded that the governing councils monetary policy measures had continued to preserve very favourable financing conditions
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9901727437973022;their ongoing passthrough supported the economic upturn which was steadily firming and broadening across sectors
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9916453957557678;strong sentiment among consumers and businesses furthermore suggested that the cyclical recovery might be gaining momentum

2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9560509324073792;as expected headline inflation had continued to increase
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.5109647512435913;this had mainly reflected a sharp rise in energy and more recently food price inflation
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Negative;0.994522213935852;the staff projections for hicp inflation had been revised upwards significantly for 2017 underlying inflation dynamics continued to be subdued
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.98774254322052;as regards the mediumterm outlook the march ecb staff projections  which included the effects of the latest nonstandard measures  broadly confirmed the december 2016 eurosystem staff projections with inflation moving towards levels below but close to 2
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.7228648662567139;however as yet one could not be sufficiently confident that inflation would converge towards levels consistent with the governing councils aim in a durable and selfsustaining manner
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9625850319862366;inflation dynamics continued to be conditional upon the present very substantial degree of monetary accommodation
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.975141704082489;against this background it was important to confirm the governing councils monetary policy stance including its forward guidance which had contributed to the present very substantial degree of accommodation
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9239101409912109;this was still needed to secure a sustained convergence of inflation rates towards levels below but close to 2 over the medium term
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9789855480194092;moreover it was a safeguard in the face of the downside risks still being confronted
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9724814891815186;in terms of communication mr praet considered it important to acknowledge the steady firming of the economic recovery while stressing that the risks although becoming less pronounced remained tilted to the downside and that the staff projections were conditional on the full implementation of the governing councils monetary policy measures
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9913538098335266;it was likewise important to clarify that in view of the upward revision to inflation for 2017 the governing council would look through changes in hicp inflation to the extent they were judged to be transient and to have no implication for the mediumterm outlook for price stability
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9777950048446655;finally it was important to confirm both the intended pace and horizon of the asset purchases and to reassert the forward guidance on policy rates and on the asset purchase programme app as previously communicated
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9809404015541077;it was furthermore appropriate to deemphasise the sense of urgency towards taking further actions that had been communicated in the past
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9888432025909424;2 governing councils discussion and monetary policy decisions economic and monetary analyses with regard to the economic analysis members broadly shared the assessment of the outlook and risks for economic activity in the euro area provided by mr praet in his introduction
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9918575882911682;recent data and survey results pointed to the economic recovery in the euro area steadily firming and broadening supported by the passthrough of the ecbs monetary policy measures while sentiment indicators in particular suggested that the cyclical recovery might be gaining momentum
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9900325536727905;looking ahead the expansion of the euro area economy was expected to continue to be driven by private consumption supported by rising employment and wages and by a cyclical recovery in business investment
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9948185086250305;at the same time growth prospects were dampened by the sluggish pace of implementation of structural reforms and remaining balance sheet adjustments in a number of sectors
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9881988763809204;this assessment was broadly reflected in the outlook for growth in the march 2017 ecb staff macroeconomic projections
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9912142157554626;compared with the december 2016 eurosystem staff projections the outlook for growth had been revised up slightly for 2017 and 2018 and was unchanged for 2019 as regards the external environment it was noted that the latest staff projections pointed to a strengthening in global growth momentum and a cyclical recovery in global trade
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9600607752799988;however the external outlook was perceived to remain very uncertain with reference made to a number of factors that were seen as contributing to this uncertainty including the nature and timing of future policy choices by the new us administration the economic impact of the united kingdoms withdrawal from the european union the transition towards lower growth and the rebalancing of demand in china and developments in other emerging market economies
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9662467241287231;the balance of risks to the outlook for global growth was generally viewed as remaining on the downside
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9784625768661499;turning to the euro area there was broad agreement with the growth outlook embodied in the march 2017 ecb staff projections which provided confirmation that the recovery in the euro area economy was continuing with small upward revisions to the outlook for 2017 and 2018 the latest projections while broadly confirming the december projections were seen as providing further evidence of the robust nature of the ongoing economic upturn although significant risks and uncertainties remained
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Positive;0.872844398021698;members observed that the large contribution from domestic demand  with net trade providing only a small contribution to growth  rendered the economy more resilient to adverse shocks
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9883318543434143;it was underlined that the forecast for real gdp growth in 2017 had gradually been revised upwards over time from 16 in the september 2016 projections to 17 in the december 2016 projections and then to 18 in the march 2017 projections
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9371868968009949;including the first quarter of 2017 there were now eleven consecutive quarters of quarteronquarter growth above the potential growth rate
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9895219206809998;the european commissions latest economic sentiment indicator and euro area pmis were very positive with the composite output pmi for the euro area at its highest level for almost six years
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Negative;0.8775596618652344;incoming data had surprised on the upside for some time
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9893069863319397;the labour market had continued to improve with unemployment declining steadily and a recovery now taking place in the housing and construction sectors
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9870201349258423;considering the components of demand it was noted that while improving corporate profitability and very favourable financing conditions should also continue to support a recovery in investment private consumption remained a key element in the growth outlook
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9918437600135803;rising employment which was also benefiting from past structural reforms was having a positive impact on households real disposable income thereby providing support for private consumption
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9811559915542603;looking ahead it was highlighted that the robustness of real income growth in the staff projections crucially depended on further growth in employment and on nominal wage growth over the projection horizon to more than offset the adverse impact of higher energy prices
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Negative;0.6481061577796936;it was remarked that at present inflation was driven mainly by higher energy prices which represented worsening terms of trade and a negative supply shock for households and firms
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9617528915405273;hence the baseline outlook for activity embodied in the projections might turn out to be overly optimistic
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9943190217018127;moreover the ecb staff projections saw employment growth as slowing while a projected strong pickup in wages was expected to soften the impact of higher energy prices on real income growth
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Positive;0.6954996585845947;together with an assumed decline in the saving ratio this underpinned private consumption growth in the staff projections
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.805596649646759;the argument was made that the projected strength in consumption was open to question given its reliance on a future pickup in wages and the assumed intertemporal consumption smoothing behaviour by households
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9486880302429199;in this context it was also noted that the ecb staff projections for euro area growth were slightly above the forecasts published by other institutions
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9927775859832764;there was broad agreement among members that risks to euro area activity were becoming more balanced but remained on the downside
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Negative;0.765134871006012;views were exchanged on the extent to which downside risks to the growth outlook had diminished and on the characterisation of the balance of risks
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9940037131309509;on the one hand it was argued that the projections reliance on stronger wages and a declining saving ratio to offset the adverse impact of higher energy prices on real income growth pointed to some downside risk to domestic demand looking ahead
2017-04-06;2017;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9898734092712402;furthermore political and economic uncertainty remained high and it was possible that the negative effects on the euro area economy from external risks  notably from the united states and brexit  might be underestimated
