2017-05-11;2017;May;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.989903211593628;65 the intuition underlying this measure is that for allocative efficiency to be achieved in a given sector where firms are assumed to face the same marginal costs resources should flow across firms until the marginal productivity of inputs is equalised
2017-05-11;2017;May;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.9777461290359496;64 the most frequently used albeit imperfect indicator of capital and labour misallocation is the dispersion in the marginal revenue product of capital and labour across firms within a given sector

2017-05-11;2017;May;Monetary Policy Decisions;Negative;0.980269491672516;a comparison between developments in both economies in the periods before and after the onset of the great recession in 2008 shows overall see the first two columns for each economy in chart 4 that the marked decline in labour productivity growth looks to be driven by a sharp reduction in the underlying rate of tfp growth in both economies
2017-05-11;2017;May;Monetary Policy Decisions;Negative;0.9840275049209596;33 a broader trend decline in tfp growth considered over the longer term and from a more global perspective it is the slowdown in tfp growth which seems to have been the key contributor to the slowdown in labour productivity growth since the mid1990s see chart 6
2017-05-11;2017;May;Monetary Policy Decisions;Positive;0.9768173098564148;all three of these elements are likely to help explain the lower rates of capital deepening seen in both the united states and euro area economies over the period of recovery
2017-05-11;2017;May;Monetary Policy Decisions;Negative;0.9726075530052184;a number of reasons have been put forward to explain the slowdown in capital deepening since 2013 these include i the strong concentration of the recovery in consumerdriven sectors common to both economies where growth is heavily concentrated in those services that are often the most labourintensive47 and in which the potential for capitallabour substitution remains somewhat limited coupled with a persisting weakness in investment in construction particularly in the euro area ii the impact of the global financial crisis and ongoing credit constraints in its aftermath discussed in section 41 below and iii some further potential for offset to the artificial degree of capital deepening seen over the depths of the crisis
2017-05-11;2017;May;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.4772876799106598;this effect has contained the rate of capital deepening and in fact fully offset the low albeit now modestly expanding rate of investment growth in the euro area
2017-05-11;2017;May;Monetary Policy Decisions;Positive;0.8904097080230713;46 however the decline in capital deepening in both economies since 2013 also reflects a marked offsetting effect arising from growth in employment which has been relatively strong in relation to the extent of the rebound in activity
2017-05-11;2017;May;Monetary Policy Decisions;Negative;0.5997121334075928;net investment has almost halved in the united states from precrisis rates to around 17 per year over the 201316 period but has fallen much more in the euro area and from a lower starting rate to just 06 per year  which is around onequarter of the euro areas precrisis average annual rate of net investment

2017-05-11;2017;May;Monetary Policy Decisions;Negative;0.8784123063087463;including estimates for 17 other advanced economies see the shaded area in chart 6 it becomes clear that a generalised decline in average rates of tfp growth is broadly detectable across advanced economies for the period since the mid1990s albeit with a modest rebound from the negative rates of growth seen in the euro area during the depths of the global financial crisis
2017-05-11;2017;May;Monetary Policy Decisions;Positive;0.684565544128418;chart 5 shows that during the depths of the crisis both economies saw some support to capital deepening  and indeed a slight increase in the rate of capital deepening in the euro area  mainly as a result of heavy shedding of labour in some countries and sectors which mechanically supported capital deepening notwithstanding markedly reduced net investment45
2017-05-11;2017;May;Monetary Policy Decisions;Negative;0.9910036325454712;the slowdown in capital deepening since 2013 reflects both a slower rate of net investment and a recovery in employment growth
2017-05-11;2017;May;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.9450315237045288;32 factors behind the postcrisis slowdown in capital deepening capital deepening refers to the process of increasing the capitallabour ratio by giving labour more capital to work with
2017-05-11;2017;May;Monetary Policy Decisions;Negative;0.9875491857528688;over the 200816 period as a whole capital deepening did not decline in the euro area and suffered only a moderate decline in the united states this was largely as a result of significant shedding of labour during the depths of the crisis period in particular during the period 200809

2017-05-11;2017;May;Monetary Policy Decisions;Negative;0.9930043816566468;while estimates vary as to the magnitudes of pre and postcrisis rates of tfp growth seen in each of the euro area and the united states due mainly to differences in methodology48 a consistent finding is that tfp growth in both has decelerated significantly since the crisis
2017-05-11;2017;May;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.9777259230613708;although it is of interest to compare the periods before and after the onset of the global financial crisis it is worth noting that the latter period can be divided into two distinct subperiods
2017-05-11;2017;May;Monetary Policy Decisions;Negative;0.9788221716880798;the first of these periods 200812 inclusive was marked by strong declines in real gdp in both economies albeit these declines did not last as long in the united states as in the euro area where they spanned both the great recession and the sovereign debt crisis
2017-05-11;2017;May;Monetary Policy Decisions;Negative;0.9936553239822388;however over the period 201316 capital deepening virtually stagnated in the euro area and the united states
