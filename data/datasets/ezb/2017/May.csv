2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9579352140426636;headline inflation had been volatile over recent months largely on account of energy and food price developments
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9945806860923767;despite the cyclical recovery underlying price pressures remained subdued as unutilised resources continued to weigh on domestic wage and price formation

2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9879581928253174;as the evidence continued to indicate insufficient progress towards a durable and selfsustaining convergence of inflation towards the governing councils mediumterm aim it was important for the time being to confirm the present monetary policy stance including the forward guidance

2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9923040270805359;it was underlined that the latest data on global activity and trade pointed to stronger global growth momentum and a resynchronisation of the recovery between global growth and trade and between advanced and emerging economies
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9711966514587402;however the external outlook was considered to be still subject to elevated uncertainty and the balance of risks to the outlook for global growth was assessed to remain on the downside
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9707671999931335;among the factors that continued to contribute to this uncertainty were the scope and timing of the future policy choices of the new us administration the economic impact of the united kingdoms withdrawal from the european union the rebalancing of demand and the transition towards lower growth rates in china and developments in other emerging market economies
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Negative;0.8607643842697144;in particular reference was made in the discussion to the high degree of uncertainty surrounding shortterm developments in the us economy which reflected a significant divergence between hard and soft data for the united states
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9942042231559753;moreover financial market participants and investors were reassessing the outlook for us growth and inflation as it appeared that us data were no longer exceeding market expectations and there was still considerable uncertainty surrounding the new us administrations policies including the prospects for fiscal stimulus and their likely expansionary effects
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9378481507301331;turning to the euro area members generally agreed that the assessment of the growth situation had improved with the latest data providing confirmation that the cyclical recovery of the euro area economy was progressing broadly in line with the baseline in the march 2017 ecb staff projections and possibly more favourably in the first half of the year
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9918223023414612;it was noted that survey data covering several months which had become available since the governing councils meeting in early march suggested that euro area growth in 2017 could be stronger than had been expected at the start of the year while the labour market had also continued to improve providing support for consumer spending
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9763129949569702;it was also remarked that developments in the citigroup economic surprise index for the euro area had continued to come out on the upside

2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.983932375907898;all in all the mediumterm growth outlook in the ecb staff projections including the expected closing of the output gap appeared to remain broadly valid
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9841268658638;in addition the firming and broadening of the economic expansion across countries and sectors should make the euro area economy more robust to any negative shocks
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Negative;0.5021366477012634;at the same time it was pointed out that caution was still warranted as the positive signals given by the european commissions economic sentiment indicator and the purchasing managers surveys had yet to be confirmed by hard data
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.8532930612564087;commenting on the components of demand it was underlined that the expansion in the euro area economy was primarily underpinned by domestic demand with the contribution to growth from the external sector being much smaller
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9906871914863586;improving corporate profitability and very favourable financing conditions should support a recovery in investment looking ahead
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9953639507293701;as mr praet had highlighted in his introduction however investment dynamics had been subdued for a number of quarters which was seen as a source of concern
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.982829749584198;in this context it was underlined that when assessing euro area investment dynamics it was important to take account of statistical factors which had strongly influenced investment in one small euro area economy last year
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Positive;0.8481982946395874;as regards consumption it was noted that the nominal disposable income of households had been rising more strongly than in the previous recovery in 2011 and even more so in real terms
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9919571876525879;in particular employment growth which had also been benefiting from past structural reforms was having a lasting positive impact on the real labour income of households and on private consumption
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9864686727523804;however it was highlighted that looking ahead disposable income growth depended on nominal wage growth and that the strong pickup in wage growth assumed in the march 2017 projection baseline was uncertain
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9857035279273987;therefore also the outlook for activity contained in the projections could turn out to be overly optimistic unless consumption was supported by a lower saving ratio compensating for the impact of higher energy prices on real disposable income
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Negative;0.8268908262252808;turning to the risk assessment there was general agreement among members that downside risks to the growth outlook had further diminished since the governing councils meeting in early march while a range of views was expressed on the characterisation of the balance of risks
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9808392524719238;it was broadly agreed that risks to the euro area economy stemming from the external environment remained on the downside
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9834096431732178;however there were differing perceptions of domestic risks to the euro area economy and hence of the overall balance of risks to economic activity in the euro area
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9907363057136536;with regard to domestic risks it was argued that the reliance of the ecb staff projections on stronger wage growth and a lower household saving ratio pointed to some downside risks to domestic demand looking ahead
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9922114610671997;it was also considered that there could be a downside risk to activity arising from the weaker than expected recent developments in private sector business investment
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Positive;0.991898775100708;however overall there was wide agreement that downside risks to activity were diminishing with the latest data and surveys supporting the assessment that the euro area economic recovery was becoming increasingly solid and suggesting that at least in the short term growth in the euro area could turn out to be stronger than previously expected
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.7789791226387024;there was also some discussion about the evolution of political uncertainty in the euro area and the extent to which this could have implications for the mediumterm outlook for growth and inflation
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9896608591079712;in this context it was recalled that while the governing council should factor into its assessment any implications of political uncertainty for the outlook for price stability over the medium term there was only limited evidence that political uncertainty had a significant negative effect on economic activity as for example illustrated by the muted economic impact to date following the outcome of the uk referendum on eu membership
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9252082705497742;on this basis no significant rebound in growth was to be expected if and when political uncertainty receded
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.7839982509613037;against this background while there was broad agreement that the configuration of risks to euro area activity had improved overall some members considered that the risks to real gdp could now be characterised as broadly balanced in particular given the improvement in recent data and indicators and the decline in political uncertainty
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9921924471855164;other members maintained that downside risks to growth still prevailed and that a change in the risk assessment was premature in view of continued risks and uncertainties even if diminishing both globally and in the euro area
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9878675937652588;it was recalled that the recent trends and the outlook of a cyclical recovery becoming more solid and broadbased benefited from exceptionally favourable financing conditions and relied on continued support from the ecbs monetary policy measures
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9851660132408142;in order to reap the full benefits from these measures however other policy areas had to contribute much more decisively to strengthening economic growth
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9825292825698853;the implementation of structural reforms needed to be substantially stepped up to increase the resilience of the euro area economy to reduce structural unemployment and to boost productivity and potential output growth
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.7008492946624756;as regards fiscal policies it was essential that all countries intensified their efforts towards achieving a more growthfriendly composition of public finances
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9334579706192017;the full and consistent implementation of the stability and growth pact and the macroeconomic imbalances procedure over time and across countries remained crucial
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9859090447425842;with regard to price developments there was broad agreement with the assessment of the outlook presented by mr praet in his introduction

2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Negative;0.7098910212516785;it was underlined that this setback followed several months of upward surprises in headline inflation and was mainly related to the volatile components of the hicp reflecting lower energy and unprocessed food price inflation although there had also been a fall in services price inflation
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Negative;0.956405758857727;annual hicp inflation excluding food and energy had been 07 in march after 09 in february and january 2017 looking more closely at the factors behind the lower rate of underlying inflation the decline was viewed as being related to significant calendar effects in several countries reflecting the deceleration in volatile travelrelated components in particular package holidays associated with the timing of the easter holidays
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Negative;0.8744475841522217;looking ahead it could therefore be argued that there would only be a minimal negative effect on the nearterm outlook for headline and core inflation while the mediumterm outlook for inflation remained intact
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.7856638431549072;however it was also remarked that a downward revision to the inflation outlook in the june 2017 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections could not be ruled out
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9913246631622314;on the basis of current oil futures prices headline inflation was likely to increase again in april and thereafter to hover around somewhat lower levels until the end of 2017 it was highlighted that measures of underlying inflation remained subdued with unutilised resources still weighing on domestic wage and price formation
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9936497807502747;disappointment was expressed that so far there had been no rebound in underlying inflation and indications of a buildup of inflation pressures were still limited

2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9527142643928528;with regard to the outlook for wage developments it was recalled that the march 2017 ecb staff projections foresaw a relatively steep pickup in wages
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9637803435325623;so far however there had not been any significant increase in wage growth despite the declining output gap and lower unemployment rates
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9857425689697266;it was considered that the role of wider measures of slack could be explored further while more generally it was felt that a more indepth investigation of wage behaviour was needed including wage settlements and bargaining processes as well as changes in income distribution
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9631716012954712;it was conjectured that structural changes in wage dynamics in europe might be at play with possible implications for longterm changes in the dynamics of underlying inflation

2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9855818152427673;for example the fiveyear forward inflationlinked swap rate five years ahead currently stood at 16
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.6095171570777893;however inflation expectations were well above the low levels seen in the summer of 2016 and it was reiterated that the risk of deflation and of an unanchoring of inflation expectations had almost completely disappeared
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9557507634162903;as regards risks to mediumterm price stability there was broad agreement that while the news on growth was more positive there had been no significant change in the assessment of the inflation outlook
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9903225302696228;at the governing councils june monetary policy meeting further important information would be available including the quarterly projections gdp data for the first quarter of 2017 and two further months of inflation data
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9071428775787354;this would facilitate a better assessment of the momentum and sustainability of the recovery and the prospects for a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9847127199172974;with regard to the monetary analysis members concurred with the assessment presented by mr praet in his introduction
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9864272475242615;m3 had continued to expand at a robust pace in february 2017 mainly supported by its most liquid components
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Positive;0.7128344178199768;the recovery in loan growth to the private sector observed since the beginning of 2014 had been proceeding
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9603041410446167;the passthrough of the monetary policy measures put in place since june 2014 had continued to support borrowing conditions for firms and households and credit flows across the euro area
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Negative;0.7496678829193115;reference was made to the continued decline in lending rates and the evidence from the latest euro area bank lending survey for the first quarter of 2017 which indicated that net loan demand had increased and bank lending conditions had further eased across all loan categories
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Negative;0.991425633430481;at the same time it was remarked that while continuing to recover the level of credit growth to the private sector remained weak
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.94887775182724;the growth rate had not risen much above 2 since the summer of 2016 notwithstanding eurosystem asset purchases which in the meantime amounted to 18 trillion
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9907955527305603;remaining fragilities in the banking sector in a number of countries notably related to the outstanding stock of nonperforming loans on banks balance sheets were seen to be holding back a stronger passthrough of the very accommodative monetary conditions and more robust credit dynamics
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Negative;0.8703036308288574;caution was expressed with respect to interpreting the qualitative balance of replies compiled in the bank lending survey and questions were raised regarding the reported crosscountry heterogeneity of the impact of the negative deposit facility rate on bank profits and lending volumes
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9452008008956909;in this context it was noted that the passthrough to bank deposit rates had so far been limited and that the ability to adjust margins was seen to depend on the degree of competitive pressures and the size of margins as well as on institutional features such as the prevalence of variable rate contracts and indexation which differed across euro area jurisdictions
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9918099045753479;it was highlighted that for the euro area overall the evidence continued to point to positive effects on lending volumes from the negative rate on the deposit facility as well as an easing impact on lending rates
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Negative;0.5942644476890564;monetary policy stance and policy considerations with regard to the monetary policy stance members widely shared the assessment provided by mr praet in his introduction that while the cyclical recovery of the euro area was becoming increasingly solid and downside risks had further diminished underlying inflation pressures had remained subdued and had yet to show a convincing upward trend
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9572445750236511;there was also broad agreement with the assessment provided by mr praet that the ecbs monetary policy measures were making a crucial contribution to preserving very favourable financing conditions which were seen as a key factor behind the ongoing cyclical recovery supporting its resilience to adverse shocks and over time a rise in inflation towards the governing councils inflation aim
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9908952713012695;in their assessment of the outlook for price stability members generally agreed that overall growth prospects had further improved
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9926865100860596;at the same time it was underlined that given continued uncertainty the outlook for inflation remained fragile
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9928473830223083;while deflation risks had virtually disappeared underlying inflation remained subdued
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.7488263845443726;moreover euro area hicp inflation had been volatile recently largely on account of energy price developments
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.8549400568008423;this underscored the need to look through transient changes in headline inflation which had no implication for the mediumterm outlook for price stability
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9857711791992188;against this background the view was widely shared that signs for a sustained adjustment in inflation had not strengthened and progress in inflation convergence to levels consistent with the governing councils inflation aim in a durable and selfsustaining manner remained as yet insufficient
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.8901314735412598;in particular the dynamism of the cyclical recovery and the baseline scenario of inflation rising towards the governing councils mediumterm inflation aim remained conditional on a substantial degree of monetary policy accommodation
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9917077422142029;hence from todays perspective there was broad agreement among members that the current monetary policy stance remained appropriate
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.989250898361206;this entailed keeping the ecbs policy rates unchanged as well as confirming both the intended pace and horizon of app purchases and the governing councils forward guidance on policy rates and the asset purchase programme including the associated easing biases
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.7197086811065674;at the same time the point was made that it could be acknowledged that recourse to these options for providing further accommodation was becoming less likely in line with the governing councils evolving assessment
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Negative;0.3685767650604248;in this context it was also again recalled that the governing councils decision in december 2016 to continue app purchases as of april 2017 at a reduced monthly pace of 60 billion as well as to carry out the last targeted longerterm refinancing operation tltro at the end of march had already reflected the governing councils more nuanced assessment of overall growing confidence in the economic performance of the euro area economy and vanishing deflation risks
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9833504557609558;looking ahead it was suggested that if the euro area recovery kept up its momentum and progress was made in attaining a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation due consideration would need to be given to adjusting the present formulation of the governing councils forward guidance
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.8967771530151367;it was highlighted that ultimately the future path of monetary policy in all its elements depended crucially on the governing councils forwardlooking indepth assessment of the outlook for price stability
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9844975471496582;there needed to be a continuous assessment of whether inflation was converging in a durable and selfsustaining manner towards the governing councils inflation aim of below but close to 2 over the medium term and whether it would remain there even under less supportive monetary policy conditions
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Positive;0.8176186680793762;at the forthcoming policy meeting in june new staff projections alongside further data and analyses would become available putting the governing council in a better position to take stock and reassess the sustainability of the recovery and the outlook for inflation
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.985249936580658;as inflation proceeded further on its path towards the governing councils inflation aim in a selfsustaining manner a more encompassing discussion on devising an appropriate strategy for policy normalisation would become warranted further in the future
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Positive;0.8554613590240479;monetary policy decisions and communication as regards communication members broadly agreed with the proposals made by mr praet in his introduction to keep the communication on the governing councils monetary policy stance and its forward guidance unchanged while conveying a more positive tone on the state of the euro area economy and highlighting the increasing solidity of the cyclical recovery and that downside risks had further diminished
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.8911392092704773;similarly the governing council needed to reiterate its confidence in the effectiveness of its monetary policy measures in supporting growth and inflation
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9733856320381165;at the same time it was felt that the governing councils communication should be adjusted in a very gradual and cautious manner as at the current juncture monetary and financial conditions were particularly sensitive to changes in communication
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9422164559364319;after a long period of very accommodative monetary conditions even small and incremental changes in communication could have strong signalling effects when interpreted as heralding a change in the monetary policy stance
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9893407225608826;a premature and unwarranted tightening of financial conditions could put the prospects of a sustained adjustment in inflation towards the governing councils inflation aim at risk particularly in an environment of persisting uncertainty
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Positive;0.7849698066711426;it was however also highlighted that a gradual adjustment in communication in step with the evolution of the governing councils assessment of the economic outlook and the balance of risks would underpin the consistency and credibility of the governing councils guidance
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9039848446846008;considering the earlier exchange of views on the balance of risks to euro area activity there was agreement among all members to emphasise in the communication that the risks to the euro area growth outlook were moving towards a more balanced configuration while still remaining tilted to the downside
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9876705408096313;prevailing uncertainties notably related to the external environment continued to call for caution
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9907873272895813;it was also agreed that the communication regarding the inflation outlook should be left unchanged
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9917299151420593;taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members on a proposal from the president the governing council decided to keep the interest rates on the eurosystems main refinancing operations the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility unchanged at 000 025 and 040 respectively
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9254857897758484;the governing council continued to expect the key ecb interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9939495325088501;regarding nonstandard monetary policy measures the governing council confirmed that the net asset purchases at the new monthly pace of 60 billion were intended to run until the end of december 2017 or beyond if necessary and in any case until the governing council saw a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9750915169715881;the net purchases would be made alongside reinvestments of the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme
2017-05-18;2017;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9530142545700073;if the outlook became less favourable or if financial conditions became inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation the governing council stood ready to increase the programme in terms of size andor duration
