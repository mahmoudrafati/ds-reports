2017-06-22;2017;June;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.9295854568481444;51 based on all these factors the global slack view argues that in the case of tradable goods and services what is decisive is no longer solely the domestic tightness or slack of economic conditions but the global tightness or slack as well because local demand and supply conditions for a given tradable good or service can to varying degrees be offset elsewhere
