2017-03-23;2017;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.925267457962036;this supports the idea that the existence of frictions in the financial markets may prevent productive firms from obtaining the resources needed to expand so that input choices differ systematically across firms in ways that are unrelated to their productivity
2017-03-23;2017;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Positive;0.7980136871337891;indeed in countrysectors with a cost of credit above the median see chart 17 and tighter credit supply standards see chart 18 capital misallocation increased significantly more over the whole period considered than in countrysectors with a lower credit cost and looser credit standards

2017-03-23;2017;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Negative;0.9590678811073304;129 the rise in capital misallocation has been particularly apparent in services
2017-03-23;2017;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Negative;0.9686712622642516;this could be related to the fact that the tertiary sector is more regulated and less exposed to international competition than for example manufacturing as well as to the fact that it is more dependent on external finance which increases its exposure to credit constraints
2017-03-23;2017;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.6396263837814331;labour misallocation has instead risen less steeply over the period 200213 or has in the case of spain even decreased after the crisis see chart 14

2017-03-23;2017;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.8467873334884644;the chart shows that capital misallocation in the postcrisis period dropped in the countrysectors with more flexible product market regulation such as manufacturing construction and distribution as a result of the exit of less productive firms and an expansion of more productive ones
2017-03-23;2017;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.9559669494628906;in countrysectors with stricter regulation by contrast the crisis did not have a similar cleansing effect
2017-03-23;2017;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Negative;0.6087563037872314;capital misallocation dynamics are also found to be correlated with demand uncertainty and credit market frictions
2017-03-23;2017;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.989528477191925;in addition to product market regulation demand uncertainty 134 is found to be strongly correlated with the observed changes in capital misallocation as illustrated in chart 16 by using the same methodology and referring to the same euro area countries as in the previous chart
2017-03-23;2017;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Neutral;0.9158716797828674;while it is wellknown that demand uncertainty reduces investment recent empirical evidence documents that it may also affect capital allocation across firms and thus aggregate productivity dynamics
2017-03-23;2017;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Negative;0.9868348240852356;heightened uncertainty is indeed conducive to all firms adopting a waitandsee strategy which means that highproductivity firms do not expand and lowproductivity firms do not downsize thereby stalling efficiencyenhancing reallocation and leading to higher resource misallocation
2017-03-23;2017;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Negative;0.894121527671814;135 moreover higher uncertainty tends to reduce the productivity growth of firms that are relatively more dependent on external finance generally small firms irrespective of their level of productivity thereby possibly leading to a more inefficient input allocation

2017-03-23;2017;March;Monetary Policy Decisions;Negative;0.7086780667304993;113 finally large multiproduct firms are less sensitive to reer movements because in response to negative exchange rate shocks they can afford to pull out their least profitable products from the export markets
