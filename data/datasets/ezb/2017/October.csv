2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Positive;0.98225337266922;on the one hand upside risks were related to the possibility that the current positive cyclical momentum could lead to a stronger than expected economic upswing
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Negative;0.889343798160553;on the other hand downside risks were seen to stem mainly from the global environment related to geopolitical factors and vulnerabilities in some emerging market economies

2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9830753803253174;in this context the speed of the recent appreciation was underlined including after the cutoff date of the projections
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8289732336997986;overall there was broad agreement among members that the recent volatility in the exchange rate of the euro was a source of uncertainty which required monitoring with regard to its possible implications for the mediumterm outlook for price stability
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9854957461357117;regarding price developments there was broad agreement with the assessment presented by mr praet in his introduction

2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9727168679237366;members agreed that while measures of underlying inflation had ticked up slightly in recent months they had nevertheless remained at subdued levels overall
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9838200807571411;underlying inflation in the euro area was expected to rise gradually over the medium term supported by the ecbs monetary policy measures the continuing economic expansion the gradual absorption of economic slack and rising wages
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9907275438308716;however while underlying inflation was expected to show a continuous upward trend on the basis of current oil futures prices annual rates of headline inflation were likely to decline temporarily towards the end of the year mainly reflecting negative base effects in energy prices
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.6608471274375916;this assessment was broadly reflected in the september 2017 ecb staff projections where the outlook for hicp inflation was unchanged for 2017 but had been revised down slightly for 2018 and 2019 reflecting mainly the recent appreciation of the euro
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9911068081855774;at the same time the questions raised about the treatment of the exchange rate in the current projections might imply some downside risks
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9861605167388916;in discussing the outlook for inflation included in the september staff projections concern was again voiced about the possibility of changes in the inflation process that might lead to low inflation rates being more persistent including the role of changes in inflation expectations and wage indexation practices
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9757983088493347;commenting on measures of underlying inflation members agreed that there were not yet convincing signs of a sustained convergence towards levels compatible with the ecbs inflation aim
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9902177453041077;at the same time a number of measures of underlying inflation had increased moderately compared with the second half of 2016 hicp inflation excluding food and energy for example had risen to 12 in august this year from around 08 a year earlier
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Positive;0.873953104019165;this pointed to tentative signs of reflationary forces slowly taking hold as the economic expansion gathered pace
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9939926266670227;it was argued that there was little doubt about the direction but more uncertainty about the pace of underlying inflation
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Positive;0.7844056487083435;in considering labour cost pressures in the latest staff projections it was noted that wage developments had remained subdued with annual growth in compensation per employee declining from 14 in the fourth quarter of 2016 to 12 in the first quarter of 2017 the argument was advanced that even if wage dynamics had so far been disappointing cost pressures should gradually increase as the economic expansion continued
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.6126155853271484;attention was again drawn to the increasing importance of nonwage components of labour costs which might reflect a shift in focus in wage negotiations in a number of countries

2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8852057456970215;overall recent developments indicated that inflation expectations remained broadly anchored and the risk of deflation had largely disappeared
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9775902628898621;at the same time some concern was expressed that a longer period of inflation below the ecbs definition of price stability could have an adverse impact on inflation expectations
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Negative;0.5446299910545349;overall while members considered that the ongoing economic expansion increased confidence that inflation dynamics would strengthen over time they continued to emphasise that patience persistence and prudence were still needed as this process was expected to take time and remained contingent on a very substantial degree of monetary policy accommodation
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9847127199172974;with regard to the monetary analysis members concurred with the assessment presented by mr praet in his introduction
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9914954900741577;broad money m3 despite some monthly volatility continued to expand at a robust pace and the gradual recovery in loan growth to the private sector visible since the start of 2014 was proceeding with a further pickup in loan growth to nonfinancial corporations
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9855624437332153;the cost of marketbased financing as well as bank lending rates for firms and households had remained near historical lows supporting euro area credit flows and a continued passthrough of monetary policy accommodation in the ongoing euro area economic expansion
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9918602108955383;it was seen as encouraging that the stock of nonperforming loans had declined further in the first quarter of 2017 amid strengthened bank capital positions and an improving earnings outlook even though overall bank profitability remained at low levels
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9892004728317261;monetary policy stance and policy considerations with regard to the monetary policy stance members widely shared the assessment provided by mr praet in his introduction that the available information overall confirmed a broadly unchanged mediumterm outlook for euro area economic growth and inflation as also entailed in the september 2017 ecb staff projections
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9931463003158569;while the economic expansion continued to be solid and broadbased across countries and sectors inflation dynamics remained subdued and signs of progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation were generally judged to still be insufficient
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9875605702400208;at the same time there were grounds for confidence that inflation would gradually converge to levels in line with the governing councils aim of inflation below but close to 2
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Negative;0.6304370760917664;members broadly agreed with mr praets assessment that financial conditions had tightened to some degree in the period since the july 2017 monetary policy meeting notably on account of the stronger euro although overall they had remained supportive of the ongoing economic expansion
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9939596652984619;longterm interest rates had fallen and borrowing conditions for firms and households remained favourable
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9515305757522583;while the recent appreciation of the euro exchange rate was seen to reflect to some degree the improved macroeconomic environment in the euro area and the associated market assessment of the outlook for the ecbs monetary policy relative to that of other major central banks concerns were expressed notably about the recent momentum
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Negative;0.5988159775733948;there was wide agreement that the recent movements in the euro exchange rate represented a source of uncertainty which required monitoring with respect to its mediumterm implications for price stability
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9653065800666809;it was underlined that while confidence in the projected path of inflation had continued to firm the ongoing economic expansion had yet to translate more convincingly into stronger inflation dynamics
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Negative;0.681090772151947;hence from todays perspective the available evidence continued to indicate that the progress towards a durable and selfsustaining convergence of inflation to the governing councils mediumterm inflation aim was not yet fully convincing and that patience was still needed
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9634488821029663;inflation was expected to remain some distance from the governing councils inflation aim for some time not least as mediumterm inflation expectations were still muted and a number of structural factors were holding back a more dynamic adjustment in inflation
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9915776252746582;at the same time confidence in the expected convergence of inflation to the objective was bolstered by the uptick in measures of underlying inflation a stabilisation in inflation expectations despite the appreciating exchange rate and the increasingly solid growth environment
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9728614687919617;the point was also made that some comfort could be drawn from the level and direction of inflation foreseen at the end of the projection horizon
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Negative;0.6324117183685303;however it was highlighted that the baseline scenario for inflation remained crucially conditional on the very favourable financing conditions that in turn largely depended on the current accommodative monetary policy stance
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.5656192302703857;against this background there was broad agreement among members that a very substantial degree of monetary accommodation was still needed for inflation pressures to build up and support headline inflation over the medium term
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.986477255821228;for the present meeting this argued for keeping the monetary policy stance unchanged
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9924627542495728;this included keeping in place all elements of the governing councils forward guidance pertaining to the ecbs key interest rates and the pace and horizon of app purchases as well as the implicit sequencing of policy instruments embedded in the forward guidance and the indication that the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the app would be reinvested for as long as necessary
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9840607047080994;moreover as the end of the intended horizon of the net asset purchases was approaching members reiterated that a decision was warranted in the autumn on the ecbs policy instruments beyond the end of the year
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9836785197257996;this decision would need to be based on a thorough assessment of the outlook for inflation the risks surrounding this outlook and the monetary policy stance and financial conditions needed for a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels below but close to 2
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9910879731178284;accordingly the eurosystem committees would continue their technical work on examining possible scenarios for the future evolution of policy instruments considering their impact on financial conditions and the mediumterm outlook for inflation and also looking at the experience of other central banks
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9845046997070312;subsequently members had a very preliminary exchange of views about the future monetary policy stance and the considerations that might guide a recalibration of instruments and the transmission channels through which they shape financial conditions and the outlook for price stability
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.958533763885498;there was broad agreement that continued substantial support from monetary policy was still needed to ensure a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels below but close to 2 over the medium term
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Positive;0.99192214012146;at the same time a stronger euro area economy and the dissipation of deflationary risks underpinned increased confidence that the governing councils inflation aim would be achieved over the medium term
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8162509202957153;a view was put forward that conditions were increasingly falling into place that would allow the intensity of monetary policy accommodation to be adapted and would provide an opportunity to scale back the eurosystems net asset purchases
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.40497392416000366;in this context a view was reiterated that looking ahead the governing council needed to regain more policy space and flexibility to adjust policy and the degree of monetary policy accommodation in either direction if and when needed to cope with a maturing business cycle and potential future shocks
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Positive;0.8908063769340515;however it was remarked that policy space would naturally emerge from a successful conduct of monetary policy that supported the recovery of the euro area economy and a swift return of inflation to levels in line with the governing councils aim
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9482327103614807;at the same time it was underlined that a very substantial degree of monetary policy accommodation was still needed for inflation to converge sustainably to levels in line with the governing councils aim
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9761634469032288;discomfort was widely expressed about the very prolonged period over which inflation had been  and was still expected to remain  distant from the governing councils aim
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8779034614562988;the governing council needed to remain fully symmetric in its commitment to achieving its policy objective
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Negative;0.8607550263404846;therefore any reassessment of the monetary policy stance should proceed in a very gradual and cautious manner while maintaining sufficient flexibility also in the light of prevailing uncertainties with respect to the inflation outlook and financial conditions
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9923291802406311;in this context on the one hand attention was drawn to the need to be mindful of market expectations and the risk of unwarranted movements in financial conditions which could jeopardise progress towards a sustained adjustment in inflation
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9417812824249268;on the other hand it was argued that expectations of a recalibration of asset purchases in the euro area after the turn of the year were incorporated in market analysts views possibly mitigating these concerns
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9923721551895142;moreover it was remarked that the assessment of the monetary policy stance needed to be firmly based on the governing councils judgement regarding inflation convergence to levels below but close to 2 over the medium term without giving undue weight to market expectations
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9928925037384033;members also discussed some general tradeoffs inherent in various scenarios for the future recalibration of the app and in particular the choice between the pace and the intended duration
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8494784235954285;within the framework of the governing councils forward guidance the benefits from a longer intended purchase horizon combined with a greater reduction in the pace were compared with those from a shorter period of purchases and larger monthly volumes
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9854366183280945;in this context the point was again made that both the costs and benefits of extending app purchases including possible financial stability risks needed to be taken into account
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9796363115310669;it was also argued that the monetary policy stance would remain highly accommodative in either scenario on account of the range of policy instruments in place most notably the reinvestment of the principal of maturing securities the liquidity related to the targeted longerterm refinancing operations and the forward guidance on the ecbs key policy rates
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9864875674247742;since the end of 2014 the eurosystem had accumulated a very large stock of public and private sector assets which would be maintained on the eurosystems balance sheet through the reinvestment of the principal payments for as long as necessary
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9848768711090088;moreover it was highlighted that the forward guidance on policy interest rates formed an integral part of the overall monetary policy stance
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9947527647018433;more generally the point was again made that the overall degree of accommodation was determined by the combination of all the monetary policy measures deployed by the ecb and that the governing councils assessment of progress regarding a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation should apply to the overall design and direction of the ecbs monetary policy stance as a whole and not with reference to any particular instrument in isolation such as the duration and pace of app purchases
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9879149198532104;as regards the timing of prospective policy decisions by the governing council there was broad agreement that the bulk of the decisions including the strategy for recalibrating the policy instruments could be taken at the forthcoming monetary policy meeting in october while the possibility that some technical decisions could be taken at a later stage could not be ruled out
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9883982539176941;monetary policy decisions and communication as regards communication members broadly agreed with the suggestions made by mr praet in his introduction
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Positive;0.9907991290092468;it was important to emphasise that the continued strong momentum of the euro area economy supported confidence that inflation would gradually reach levels in line with the ecbs mediumterm objective

2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.8312391042709351;there was broad agreement to emphasise as on previous occasions the need for monetary policy to remain persistent and patient
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Negative;0.9155827164649963;a very substantial degree of monetary accommodation was still necessary for inflation pressures to build up
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9336690306663513;for the present meeting this implied confirming that all elements of the governing councils forward guidance would be maintained including the implied sequencing of policy instruments embedded in the forward guidance and reiterating the governing councils continued readiness to increase the size andor duration of its asset purchases if needed
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Positive;0.5069310069084167;looking ahead there was a benefit to clear and forwardlooking communication by the governing council while some flexibility was required in order to appropriately prepare and calibrate the necessary degree of monetary accommodation
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9911297559738159;therefore it needed to be reiterated that the governing council would decide in the autumn on the calibration of its policy instruments beyond the end of the year taking into account the expected path of inflation and the financial conditions required for a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels below but close to 2
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9919911026954651;in this context it needed to be highlighted that any reassessment of the monetary policy stance was based on the governing councils assessment of the mediumterm outlook for price stability
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9927937984466553;taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members on a proposal from the president the governing council decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility would remain unchanged at 000 025 and 040 respectively
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.986552894115448;the governing council expected the key ecb interest rates to remain at their present levels for an extended period of time and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9941556453704834;regarding nonstandard monetary policy measures the governing council confirmed that the net asset purchases at the current monthly pace of 60 billion were intended to run until the end of december 2017 or beyond if necessary and in any case until the governing council saw a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9750915169715881;the net purchases would be made alongside reinvestments of the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme
2017-10-05;2017;October;REPORT;Neutral;0.9530142545700073;if the outlook became less favourable or if financial conditions became inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation the governing council stood ready to increase the programme in terms of size andor duration
