2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9829044938087463;at the same time a careful and gradual recalibration was warranted in a more benign economic environment in line with the governing councils established reaction function as shown on earlier occasions when the pace of the app had been adjusted up or down depending on developments in the data
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9285078644752502;in this context it was highlighted that the proposed app recalibration from the yearend was in line with prevailing market expectations and was hence unlikely to trigger significant movements in financial prices
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8771530985832214;it was however recalled that monetary policy decisions needed to be firmly based on the governing councils judgement on what was required to achieve its mediumterm objective without giving undue weight to market expectations which in turn could be highly sensitive to central bank communication
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9777786135673523;against this background a large majority of members supported the proposal made by mr praet in his introduction
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.987939715385437;this comprised an extension of the net asset purchases at a monthly pace of 30 billion for nine months until the end of september 2018 or beyond if necessary unchanged forward guidance on policy rates and on the app and a clarification of the forward guidance on the reinvestment of principal payments
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9871059656143188;in discussing this proposal a range of views was expressed on specific elements
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9779828786849976;as regards the pace the view was put forward that a reduction in monthly app purchases was consistent with a larger impact of a given flow of net purchases reflecting the growing stock of acquired assets and fewer bonds remaining available in the market
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.674426257610321;as the eurosystem had already acquired a sizeable stock of assets which would increase further over the coming months and would be maintained via reinvestments for as long as necessary monetary policy would remain expansionary even with a slower monthly pace of purchases
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9278826117515564;the point was also made however that the asset purchase programmes might be subject to diminishing returns as market conditions the economy and the inflation outlook improved over time
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9923842549324036;against this background some initial preferences were expressed for a smaller overall envelope of intended app purchases as well as for a different monthly pace of purchases for a given intended envelope
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9151824116706848;on the one hand it was argued that a higher monthly purchase volume from january 2018 implied a more gradual reduction in the pace of purchases thereby limiting the risk of cliff effects which could arise from too abrupt a reduction in the purchase volume
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.5691366195678711;on the other hand some initial preferences were also expressed for a slower monthly pace of purchases from the start of 2018 or a declining path of purchases as of january 2018 as better suited to conducting the asset purchases over an extended horizon or to exercising the optionality embedded in the governing councils forward guidance within the agreed parameters governing app purchases
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9895781874656677;all in all broad agreement emerged among members that the proposed reduction to a monthly purchase volume of 30 billion could be considered adequate
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9071338772773743;the slower pace reflected first and foremost the growing confidence in the gradual convergence of inflation towards the governing councils inflation aim
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9625938534736633;while there was a continued need for monetary policy to remain accommodative robust growth momentum very favourable financial market and borrowing conditions dissipated deflation risks and nascent signs of rising price pressures made a strong case for scaling back the intensity of the monthly purchases
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9859651327133179;as regards the purchase horizon members generally agreed with the proposed ninemonth extension
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9419655203819275;while the strong broadbased economic momentum had clearly increased the governing councils confidence in a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation the governing council had to remain patient and persistent in order to continue to provide the necessary accommodation in the face of remaining uncertainties
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.7190732359886169;a horizon of a further nine months of net purchases was considered sufficiently long to ensure a more lasting stimulus supporting a gradual rise in inflation also in view of the expected vshaped pattern and in the presence of structural factors preventing a more dynamic pickup in inflation
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9855709075927734;in this regard the envisaged purchase horizon served to underline the governing councils commitment to its price stability objective and also entailed a prolonged market presence in view of possible future shocks
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9075079560279846;in addition it was remarked that in the current more favourable financial and economic environment investors had likely become more patient and discounted future purchases less heavily which supported the effectiveness of a purchase plan to be executed at lower volumes for a longer period
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9236373901367188;finally spreading bond purchases over a longer horizon was also seen as having important implications for policy rate expectations via the sequencing embodied in the governing councils forward guidance which so far had provided a useful anchor for market expectations of future policy rates
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9749812483787537;on this basis a longer life span for the net asset purchases should further reinforce the governing councils forward guidance on policy rates thereby enhancing the necessary monetary stimulus by anchoring rate expectations well past the end of the net asset purchases
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Negative;0.6097592711448669;at the same time caution was expressed concerning an overly long horizon which might be perceived as unduly limiting the governing councils flexibility to respond appropriately to evolving data
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9774301052093506;arguments were also put forward in favour of alternative purchase horizons
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9650285243988037;on the one hand it was noted that the very robust economic recovery could be used to argue in favour of a shorter purchase horizon and hence a potentially swifter phasingout of asset purchases in the future
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9641627073287964;on the other hand the expected very gradual rise in inflation over the coming years including a vshaped pattern in the early part of the horizon argued in favour of a somewhat longer purchase horizon thereby providing more prolonged monetary support to accompany the sustained adjustment in inflation towards the governing councils inflation aim
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9852187037467957;with regard to the dimension of optionality different positions were put forward as to whether an openended statecontingent formulation remained appropriate or whether the announcement of an end date was preferable
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9936659932136536;a large majority of members supported keeping the current formulation of the governing councils forward guidance on the app in place whereby the purchases were intended to be conducted until the end of september 2018 or beyond if necessary and in any case until the governing council saw a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9847413897514343;allowing the path of the app to be adapted in a datacontingent manner and therefore maintaining the flexibility to react to future shocks was seen to be an integral part of the governing councils established reaction function and consistent with previous adjustments to the programme
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.7501538991928101;given the current assessment of the inflation outlook when more convincing evidence of price pressures had yet to be observed in the data and uncertainties still prevailed it was seen as more prudent to keep the flexibility to extend the programme further if necessary
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.6138298511505127;therefore retaining the openendedness of the app underscored the governing councils steadfast commitment to preserve the degree of accommodation needed for inflation to return towards levels that were below but close to 2
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Negative;0.993945300579071;it was cautioned that any doubt about the governing councils price stability commitment could entrench inflation expectations at low levels
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9887505173683167;together with a lower equilibrium real interest rate this could hamper the governing councils capacity to respond to future shocks
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Negative;0.8824735879898071;in addition the announcement of an end date could induce market participants to frontload possible price adjustments which might lead to an undue tightening in financial conditions
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9700815081596375;in this overall context broad support was also expressed for keeping the easing bias of the app in place
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9403984546661377;it was seen as important to signal the governing councils continued readiness and capacity to act in response to contingencies by changing the pace andor horizon of app purchases notably if the outlook became less favourable or if financial conditions became inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9841631650924683;arguments were also put forward by a few members reflecting also further members initial preferences in favour of announcing a clear end date for the app
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9632030725479126;such an end date was viewed to be well justified in anticipation of further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation on the basis of the better than expected growth momentum diminishing risks and continued favourable financing conditions for the real economy
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.5330404043197632;even if market participants were mostly not expecting an announcement of an end date the impact on financial markets was seen to be limited
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Negative;0.7110944986343384;in addition the economic expansion was judged to be sufficiently robust to cope with somewhat tighter financial conditions
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.986049473285675;an announcement of an end date was also seen as being consistent with a datacontingent conduct of monetary policy as it would not preclude the governing councils flexibility to react to incoming data in the future by adapting the monetary policy stance more broadly
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8581228852272034;moreover a view was put forward that there was no longer a case for an openended extension unless deflation risks were to reemerge
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9872013330459595;it was also argued that the balance of costs and benefits was becoming increasingly unfavourable as time progressed
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.8207623958587646;therefore while it was acknowledged that continued accommodation was still needed it was important to end the programme in a timely but orderly fashion
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Negative;0.978943407535553;some concerns were also expressed that the openended nature of the app might generate expectations of further extensions as the intended end date of the programme approached

2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9786145091056824;hence expectations needed to be managed carefully depending on progress with a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9852662682533264;at the same time as on previous occasions it was highlighted that the inbuilt flexibility of the programme permitted the governing council to maintain the programmes openendedness and to respond to adverse contingencies if necessary
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.80308598279953;as regards the composition of the asset purchases beyond the yearend broad agreement was expressed with the proposal made by mr cœuré that the purchase volumes under the three private sector purchase programmes should remain sizeable
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.6334826350212097;in this context a remark was made that the cspp was perceived as favouring large companies over smes
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9908087253570557;it was however clarified that purchases under the cspp were conducted in a nondistortive and nondiscriminatory manner whereby bonds were purchased in line with the market capitalisation of the respective bond issuance
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9371790289878845;at the same time it was highlighted that corporate bond purchases had been very effective in strengthening the crediteasing impact of the app contributing to the very favourable financing conditions of nfcs more broadly
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9544288516044617;this not only applied to the firms whose bonds were eligible for the cspp but to the whole corporate sector as the improved market funding conditions for large firms had important spillover effects for the availability and pricing of bank credit to nfcs including smes
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9933006763458252;overall it was agreed that some further assessment of the cspps impact on market functioning and pricing should be carried out also with a view to identifying relevant monetary policy transmission channels
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9888002872467041;broad agreement was expressed among members to maintain the forward guidance on interest rates unchanged as proposed by mr praet in his introduction
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9857446551322937;it was recalled that the forward guidance on policy rates formed an integral part of the overall monetary policy stance which included the embedded sequencing of policy instruments
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9947426319122314;the view was reiterated by several members that the present forward guidance linking the app purchases to the criteria for a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation should be replaced over time with a reference to the monetary policy stance in all its dimensions
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9836164712905884;in this respect it needed to be highlighted that the monetary policy stance would remain highly accommodative via the accumulated stock of assets and the forward guidance on policy rates which would continue to accompany the cycle and the return of inflation to the governing councils inflation aim
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9858993887901306;as regards the reinvestment of the principal payments from maturing securities there was broad agreement on the proposal to clarify the forward guidance on the eurosystems future reinvestments
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9895029067993164;it needed to be stressed that reinvestments would be conducted for an extended period of time after the end of the net asset purchases and in any case for as long as necessary
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9356274008750916;this was seen to contribute to favourable liquidity conditions and to an appropriate monetary policy stance
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Positive;0.6572140455245972;in this context it was highlighted that together with the forward guidance on interest rates maintaining the accumulated stock of assets continued to ensure a highly accommodative monetary policy stance which would continue to accompany the economic cycle and the return of inflation to the governing councils inflation aim
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.944428026676178;members welcomed the proposal made by mr cœuré to supplement the recalibration of the app with increased transparency on the profile of redemptions and implied reinvestment amounts
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9775696396827698;in particular in the light of the prevailing uncertainty among market participants over future reinvestments by the eurosystem there was broad support for the monthly publication of the expected monthly redemption amounts under the app over a rolling 12month horizon
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9905372262001038;this was seen as particularly important at the current juncture given the increasing relevance of reinvestments owing to the sizeable redemptions that would be seen in 2018 together with the announcement on the pace of net purchases the additional information on redemptions would provide market participants with a precise indication of the expected gross purchases of the eurosystem
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9825849533081055;the principal redemptions would be reinvested by the eurosystem in a flexible and timely manner depending on market liquidity conditions
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9820502996444702;finally members agreed to extend the fixed rate full allotment procedure for the mros and threemonth ltros for as long as necessary and at least until the end of the last reserve maintenance period of 2019 as proposed by mr cœuré
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9908244609832764;the rates in these ltros would be fixed at the average rate of the mros over the life of the respective ltro
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Positive;0.8361766934394836;the extension of the fixed rate full allotment procedure was seen as ensuring the continued smooth implementation of monetary policy as one element of the nonstandard monetary policy measures in place while safeguarding conditions in euro area money markets
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9502432942390442;it was argued however that the fixed rate full allotment procedure had become less relevant at the current juncture given the prevailing levels of excess liquidity and overall improvements in banks financial soundness
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9851014614105225;as regards communication there was wide agreement among members with the proposals put forward by mr praet in his introduction
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Negative;0.7196253538131714;it was thus seen as important to stress the unabated growth momentum including the nearterm upside risks which clearly increased the governing councils confidence in the sustained convergence of inflation towards its inflation aim
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9926782846450806;at the same time it had to be acknowledged that inflation dynamics remained subdued overall
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Positive;0.49668726325035095;accordingly it needed to be highlighted that progress towards the governing councils inflation aim still required an ample degree of monetary stimulus which supported the governing councils recalibration at the present meeting of its policy instruments beyond the yearend
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Positive;0.8798325061798096;regarding the app it needed to be emphasised that its recalibration was appropriate reflecting on the one hand the increasingly robust and broadbased economic expansion an uptick in measures of underlying inflation and the continued effective passthrough of the ecbs policy measures to the financing conditions of the real economy and on the other hand the continued need for patience and persistence
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9814640879631042;hence it had to be underlined that the recalibration of policy instruments was entirely consistent with maintaining a substantial degree of monetary policy accommodation preserving favourable financing conditions
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9840775728225708;in this context and in the light of the reduction in the monthly pace of net asset purchases it was seen as important to highlight that the monetary stimulus necessary to achieve a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation was provided by the full range of monetary policy measures in place notably by the additional net asset purchases by the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the forthcoming reinvestments and by the forward guidance on interest rates
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9840598106384277;in this regard the unchanged forward guidance on policy rates and on the app needed to be highlighted while underlining the clarification of the forward guidance on reinvestments
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9940219521522522;monetary policy decisions and communication taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members on a proposal from the president the governing council decided that the interest rate on the mros and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility would remain unchanged at 000 025 and 040 respectively
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9708134531974792;the governing council continued to expect the key ecb interest rates to remain at their present levels for an extended period of time and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9934159517288208;as regards nonstandard monetary policy measures purchases under the app would continue at the current monthly pace of 60 billion until the end of december 2017 from january 2018 the net asset purchases would continue at a monthly pace of 30 billion until the end of september 2018 or beyond if necessary and in any case until the governing council saw a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9710162878036499;purchase volumes under the three private sector programmes would remain sizeable
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9481282234191895;if the outlook became less favourable or if financial conditions became inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation the governing council stood ready to increase the app in terms of size andor duration
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9852264523506165;the eurosystem would reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the app for an extended period of time after the end of its net asset purchases and in any case for as long as necessary
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9642565846443176;this would contribute both to favourable liquidity conditions and to an appropriate monetary policy stance
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9943894743919373;the mros and the threemonth ltros would continue to be conducted as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as necessary and at least until the end of the last reserve maintenance period of 2019 furthermore the governing council decided to publish each month starting immediately the expected monthly redemption amounts under the app over a rolling 12month horizon
2017-11-23;2017;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9702200293540955;it also decided to provide additional details on the implementation of the programme reflecting the ecbs commitment to increase transparency further via a separate press release additional information on asset purchase programme
