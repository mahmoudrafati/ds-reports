2019-05-23;2019;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9855103492736816;with regard to price developments there was broad agreement with the assessment presented by mr praet in his introduction

2019-05-23;2019;May;REPORT;Negative;0.8010061979293823;on the basis of current futures prices for oil headline inflation was likely to decline over the coming months
2019-05-23;2019;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9895692467689514;measures of underlying inflation remained generally muted but labour cost pressures had strengthened and broadened amid high levels of capacity utilisation and tightening labour markets
2019-05-23;2019;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9861574172973633;looking ahead underlying inflation was expected to increase over the medium term supported by the ecbs monetary policy measures the ongoing economic expansion and rising wage growth
2019-05-23;2019;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9817600846290588;members acknowledged the negative surprise in the march outcome for hicp inflation excluding energy and food
2019-05-23;2019;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.6570672392845154;a need for caution was expressed though as the interpretation of this surprise was complicated by the impact of recent methodological changes in the compilation of the hicp and calendar effects related to the timing of easter
2019-05-23;2019;May;REPORT;Negative;0.6629289388656616;members underlined that the transmission of wage inflation to consumer price inflation remained a key issue for the mediumterm inflation outlook
2019-05-23;2019;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9943209886550903;although according to the latest data growth in compensation per employee in the euro area continued to stand above its longterm average it was observed that the lack of passthrough of wages to underlying inflation so far implied that firms and retailers were compressing their profit margins rather than raising prices
2019-05-23;2019;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9903895258903503;all in all however it was generally considered that the observed wage growth should also lead to higher inflation in due course

2019-05-23;2019;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9930190443992615;at the same time the deterioration was seen to mainly reflect a response to the weaker economic outlook rather than an unanchoring of inflation expectations
2019-05-23;2019;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9846546649932861;with regard to the monetary analysis members widely shared the assessment provided by mr praet in his introduction

2019-05-23;2019;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9483076333999634;the narrow monetary aggregate m1 had remained the main contributor to broad money growth
2019-05-23;2019;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9030645489692688;the gradually declining contribution to the growth momentum of m3 from the app continued to be replaced by a rising contribution from credit to the private sector which had remained robust
2019-05-23;2019;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9940377473831177;at the same time a remark was made that the gradual recovery in the growth of mfi loans to the private sector which had been observed since the beginning of 2014 showed signs of stalling in a number of countries

2019-05-23;2019;May;REPORT;Negative;0.5539453625679016;structural factors such as cost efficiency excess capacity and the need for consolidation were seen to be primarily responsible for this
2019-05-23;2019;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.8688213229179382;it was reiterated that further analysis was warranted on the effects of persistently low and negative interest rates on banks interest rate margins and profitability as well as on the potential implications for bank intermediation and financial stability over time
2019-05-23;2019;May;REPORT;Positive;0.6772196292877197;in this context the point was made that in the responses to the bank lending survey banks had indicated that the negative deposit facility rate was still contributing to increased lending volumes across all loan categories
2019-05-23;2019;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9887979626655579;monetary policy stance and policy considerations with regard to the monetary policy stance members broadly agreed with the assessment provided by mr praet in his introduction
2019-05-23;2019;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9794331789016724;the incoming information since the governing councils march 2019 monetary policy meeting had confirmed that the slower growth momentum was extending into the current year and might delay convergence to the governing councils mediumterm inflation aim
2019-05-23;2019;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9489467740058899;at the same time further albeit slowing employment gains and rising wages continued to underpin the resilience of the domestic economy and gradually rising inflation pressures

2019-05-23;2019;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9844182729721069;significant monetary policy stimulus would be provided by the forward guidance on the key ecb interest rates reinforced by the reinvestments of the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the new series of tltros
2019-05-23;2019;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.993891716003418;the present monetary policy stance was considered to be consistent with the governing councils datadriven approach to monetary policy oriented towards the medium term

2019-05-23;2019;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9927575588226318;against this background the governing council reiterated its determination to stand ready to adjust all of its monetary policy tools as appropriate to ensure that inflation continued to move towards its aim in a sustained manner
2019-05-23;2019;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9924591183662415;it was emphasised that inflation was ultimately a monetary phenomenon while structural factors and other policy areas were responsible for determining growth potential and reaping the full benefits of the governing councils monetary policy

2019-05-23;2019;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9231610298156738;the pricing of the new tltroiii operations should be datadependent and take into account a thorough assessment of the bankbased transmission channel of monetary policy as well as further developments in the economic outlook
2019-05-23;2019;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9656047224998474;some arguments were put forward in favour of pricing the new operations so that they would primarily serve as a backstop providing insurance in times of elevated uncertainty
2019-05-23;2019;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9816008806228638;other arguments supported the view that the tltroiii operations should also be seen as a potential tool for adjusting the monetary policy stance
2019-05-23;2019;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.990666925907135;members supported the proposal made by mr praet in his introduction that in addition to assessing the pricing of the new tltroiii operations the governing council should also consider in its regular assessment whether the preservation of the favourable implications of negative interest rates for the economy called for the mitigation of their possible side effects if any on bank intermediation
2019-05-23;2019;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9823487401008606;turning to communication members widely agreed with the elements proposed by mr praet in his introduction

2019-05-23;2019;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9516279697418213;an ample degree of monetary policy accommodation remained necessary to safeguard favourable financing conditions and support the economic expansion and thus to ensure that inflation remained on a sustained path towards levels below but close to 2 over the medium term
2019-05-23;2019;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.947566568851471;in this regard it was important to reiterate that significant monetary policy stimulus was being provided by the governing councils forward guidance on the key ecb interest rates reinforced by the reinvestments of the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the announced new series of tltros
2019-05-23;2019;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.8704409003257751;it was also worth reiterating that on account of the stock effects of the sizeable app portfolio the end of net asset purchases did not represent a tightening of the monetary policy stance

2019-05-23;2019;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.991446852684021;the governing council expected the key ecb interest rates to remain at their present levels at least through the end of 2019 and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that were below but close to 2 over the medium term
2019-05-23;2019;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9748100638389587;the governing council intended to continue reinvesting in full the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme for an extended period of time past the date when it started raising the key ecb interest rates and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation
