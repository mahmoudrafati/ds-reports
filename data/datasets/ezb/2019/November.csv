2019-11-21;2019;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.5927627086639404;euro area annual hicp inflation had decreased from 10 in august 2019 to 08 in september reflecting lower food and energy price inflation
2019-11-21;2019;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9524164795875549;measures of underlying inflation had remained generally muted and indicators of inflation expectations stood at low levels
2019-11-21;2019;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9954909682273865;while labour cost pressures had strengthened amid tighter labour markets the weaker growth momentum was delaying their passthrough to inflation
2019-11-21;2019;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9909530878067017;over the medium term inflation was expected to increase supported by the ecbs monetary policy measures the ongoing economic expansion and robust wage growth
2019-11-21;2019;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9923533797264099;it was emphasised that headline inflation was currently being dampened by low energy price inflation
2019-11-21;2019;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9369784593582153;the latest inflation data had confirmed the expectations embedded in the september 2019 projections and the absence of major forecast errors for core inflation in recent months supported the projection of an upward movement in underlying inflation dynamics
2019-11-21;2019;November;REPORT;Negative;0.5264144539833069;one element that had dampened core inflation but was now starting to fade out was a statistical downward impact on the annual rate of change of package holiday prices associated with a change in consumer expenditure weights in the largest euro area economy
2019-11-21;2019;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9769412875175476;looking ahead it was argued that an increase in underlying inflation might not readily materialise given the current weaker macroeconomic outlook
2019-11-21;2019;November;REPORT;Positive;0.49708330631256104;members agreed with the assessment that wage growth continued to be solid and underlined its crucial role in the expected upward adjustment of inflation
2019-11-21;2019;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9882446527481079;in this context it was remarked that the most recent spf indicated a downwardsloping path for wage growth
2019-11-21;2019;November;REPORT;Positive;0.4910939037799835;at the same time it was suggested that while there might be a slight slowdown in wage dynamics the expected inflation adjustment currently hinged more on the delayed passthrough of wage growth into prices and a recovery in profit markups
2019-11-21;2019;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9909622073173523;it was pointed out that profit margins had not increased in previous years despite a positive economic outlook which raised doubts as to whether they would increase now in the context of a worsened outlook
2019-11-21;2019;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9788004755973816;as regards longerterm inflation expectations members noted the further decline in surveybased measures
2019-11-21;2019;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9911853671073914;concern was expressed in particular with respect to the consecutive downward revisions to longerterm inflation expectations in the ecbs spf
2019-11-21;2019;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9297451376914978;it was argued that survey and marketbased indicators  when adjusted for estimates of liquidity and risk premia  showed a similar picture of a downward shift in longerterm expectations
2019-11-21;2019;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9851697087287903;with regard to the monetary analysis members widely shared the assessment provided by mr lane in his introduction
2019-11-21;2019;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9908584952354431;overall the signals provided by money and credit developments remained positive as broad money m3 growth and credit to the private sector were at their highest levels since 2009 sustained rates of broad money growth reflected ongoing bank credit creation for the private sector and low opportunity costs of holding m3
2019-11-21;2019;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9925514459609985;the growth of loans to firms and households had remained robust benefiting from the continued passthrough of the accommodative monetary policy stance to bank lending rates which remained at historical lows
2019-11-21;2019;November;REPORT;Negative;0.8392459154129028;favourable bank lending conditions were also evidenced by the euro area bank lending survey for the third quarter of 2019 it was noted however that the financial stability implications needed to be monitored closely as declining bank lending rates could squeeze banks margins beyond adequate risk coverage
2019-11-21;2019;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9635509252548218;moreover the point was made that more attention needed to be paid to the nonbank financial sectors where looser marketbased financing conditions and the search for yield also posed risks
2019-11-21;2019;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9883755445480347;monetary policy stance and policy considerations with regard to the monetary policy stance members widely shared the assessment provided by mr lane in his introduction
2019-11-21;2019;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9546346664428711;the package of measures decided at the governing councils september monetary policy meeting had to a large extent preserved the highly favourable financial conditions prevailing in the period before that meeting in part owing to the anticipation of further monetary policy easing
2019-11-21;2019;November;REPORT;Positive;0.8660575151443481;this was seen as demonstrating that markets had well understood the reaction function of the governing council
2019-11-21;2019;November;REPORT;Negative;0.8192422986030579;despite some upward movement at the front end of the yield curve since the september monetary policy meeting taking a somewhat longer perspective financial conditions had eased significantly since the sintra conference in june this year
2019-11-21;2019;November;REPORT;Negative;0.7418443560600281;it was underlined that the incoming information since the september monetary policy meeting had confirmed the pronounced slowdown in euro area economic growth and a continued shortfall of inflation with respect to the inflation aim thus vindicating the monetary policy decisions taken by the governing council at that meeting
2019-11-21;2019;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.98723965883255;there was wide agreement that more information would be needed to reassess the inflation outlook and the impact of the monetary policy measures particularly given that some of the measures had yet to be implemented  notably the resumption of net asset purchases and the introduction of a twotier system for reserve remuneration
2019-11-21;2019;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9910621643066406;therefore the measures should be allowed more time to fully unfold their effects on the euro area economy and ultimately on inflation outcomes taking into account the usual transmission lags of monetary policy
2019-11-21;2019;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9884875416755676;confidence was expressed that the comprehensive package of policy measures decided at the september meeting provided substantial monetary stimulus which would contribute to a further easing in borrowing conditions for firms and households
2019-11-21;2019;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.98723965883255;this would support the euro area expansion the ongoing buildup of domestic price pressures and thus the sustained convergence of inflation to the governing councils mediumterm inflation aim
2019-11-21;2019;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9925290942192078;against this background the members agreed with the proposal made by mr lane in his introduction to keep the monetary policy stance unchanged at the current meeting
2019-11-21;2019;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9752354621887207;this entailed confirming the resumption of net asset purchases under the governing councils asset purchase programme at a monthly pace of 20 billion as from 1 november 2019 and reiterating the forward guidance on policy interest rates net asset purchases and reinvestments
2019-11-21;2019;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9850150942802429;there was broad agreement that monetary policy had to remain highly accommodative for an extended period of time in the face of a protracted weakness in the economy and subdued inflation developments
2019-11-21;2019;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9819644689559937;accordingly it was important to fully implement the september monetary policy decisions
2019-11-21;2019;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9405488967895508;in this context it was highlighted that the governing councils forward guidance provided an important stabilisation function as mr lane had pointed out in his introduction
2019-11-21;2019;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9441174268722534;the strengthened statebased forward guidance decided at the september monetary policy meeting which had more clearly tied the likely path of policy interest rates to inflation prospects ensured that financial conditions would adjust in accordance with changes in the inflation outlook thereby reinforcing the governing councils commitment to achieving its inflation aim
2019-11-21;2019;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9899252653121948;it was argued that the statebased nature of the forward guidance which depended on a forwardlooking component whereby the inflation outlook had to be seen to converge robustly to a level sufficiently close to but below 2 within the projection horizon as well as on a backwardlooking component whereby the convergence of inflation had to be consistently reflected in the observed dynamics of underlying inflation provided a clear guide to the governing councils reaction function
2019-11-21;2019;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9834325909614563;strong commitment by the governing council to providing the necessary policy stimulus was seen as important to ensure the sustained convergence of inflation to the governing councils aim
2019-11-21;2019;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9939760565757751;accordingly it was vital for the governing council to remain prepared to act by using its full set of instruments if the inflation outlook so required
2019-11-21;2019;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9894160032272339;it was however cautioned that due account also had to be taken of the assessment of the possible side effects of monetary policy measures
2019-11-21;2019;November;REPORT;Negative;0.8295256495475769;at the same time a plea was made for patience to allow the measures taken in september to work through the economy supporting a wait and see posture at the current juncture
2019-11-21;2019;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.986299455165863;as regards communication members widely agreed with the proposals made by mr lane in his introduction
2019-11-21;2019;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.7398613691329956;it needed to be stressed that the september monetary policy package supported the sustained convergence of inflation towards the governing councils aim while noting that the transmission of the individual measures would take time to work its way through to growth and inflation dynamics
2019-11-21;2019;November;REPORT;Negative;0.5235726237297058;at the same time the governing council needed to forcefully reiterate its unwavering commitment to achieving its inflation aim and the need for a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy for a prolonged period of time to support underlying inflation pressures and headline inflation developments over the medium term
2019-11-21;2019;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.986946165561676;in the light of the persistence of prominent downside risks surrounding the euro area outlook it also needed to be emphasised that the governing council continued to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments as appropriate to ensure that inflation moved towards its aim in a sustained manner in line with its commitment to symmetry
2019-11-21;2019;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9696385860443115;looking ahead a strong call was made for unity of the governing council
2019-11-21;2019;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9757601618766785;while it was underlined that open and frank discussions in the governing council were absolutely necessary and legitimate it was regarded as important to form a consensus and to unite behind the governing councils commitment to pursuing its inflation aim
2019-11-21;2019;November;REPORT;Positive;0.824337363243103;furthermore the call on other policymakers was reiterated emphasising that they needed to contribute more decisively to supporting the euro area economy
2019-11-21;2019;November;REPORT;Negative;0.9916152358055115;in particular fiscal policy notably of governments with fiscal space had to play a more prominent role to stabilise economic conditions in view of the weakening economic outlook and the continued prominence of downside risks
2019-11-21;2019;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9935738444328308;monetary policy decisions and communication taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members on a proposal from the president the governing council decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility would remain unchanged at 000 025 and 050 respectively
2019-11-21;2019;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9889124631881714;the governing council expected the key ecb interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels until it saw the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to but below 2 within its projection horizon and such convergence was consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics
2019-11-21;2019;November;REPORT;Neutral;0.9931199550628662;as decided at the governing councils meeting on 1112 september 2019 net purchases would be restarted under the governing councils asset purchase programme at a monthly pace of 20 billion as from 1 november 2019 the governing council expected them to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of its policy rates and to end shortly before it started raising the key ecb interest rates
2019-11-21;2019;November;REPORT;Positive;0.9748100638389587;the governing council intended to continue reinvesting in full the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme for an extended period of time past the date when it started raising the key ecb interest rates and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation
