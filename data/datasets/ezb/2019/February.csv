2019-02-21;2019;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9396981000900269;on the basis of current futures prices for oil headline inflation was likely to decrease further over the coming months
2019-02-21;2019;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9751282334327698;measures of underlying inflation remained generally muted but domestic cost pressures were continuing to strengthen and broaden amid high levels of capacity utilisation and tightening labour markets
2019-02-21;2019;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9861574172973633;looking ahead underlying inflation was expected to increase over the medium term supported by the ecbs monetary policy measures the ongoing economic expansion and rising wage growth
2019-02-21;2019;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9678515195846558;as regards the possible implications of weaker growth for the mediumterm inflation outlook it was argued that more information was needed for a thorough assessment
2019-02-21;2019;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9822094440460205;in this context it was noted that the labour market had so far continued to improve with labour shortages becoming more apparent in some member states although more broadly some deceleration in employment growth had been observed
2019-02-21;2019;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9529889225959778;members considered that recent developments in wage growth continued to provide some reassurance regarding the outlook for underlying inflation
2019-02-21;2019;February;REPORT;Positive;0.7575375437736511;compensation per employee in the euro area as a whole had risen by 25 in the third quarter of 2018 having increased steadily since 2016 while the pickup in wage growth had become broaderbased across countries and sectors
2019-02-21;2019;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.7184323668479919;it was also argued that the relatively high level of headline inflation in 2018 would continue to affect wage negotiations which often contained a backwardlooking component
2019-02-21;2019;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9581531882286072;it was widely emphasised that the transmission of higher wages to consumer price inflation was a key issue for the mediumterm outlook for inflation and an important source of uncertainty regarding the inflation outlook that was seen to require close monitoring
2019-02-21;2019;February;REPORT;Positive;0.8194727897644043;it was noted that while the relationship between wages and unemployment appeared to be intact there had so far been little response in underlying inflation measures to improving labour market conditions
2019-02-21;2019;February;REPORT;Negative;0.6082634925842285;this was illustrated by the fact that over the previous five years underlying inflation had been stable at around 1 while unemployment had fallen from around 12 to just below 8
2019-02-21;2019;February;REPORT;Negative;0.5665484666824341;underlying inflation had not risen even in the period when the economy was growing very quickly
2019-02-21;2019;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9801534414291382;members also discussed the behaviour of profit margins and markups
2019-02-21;2019;February;REPORT;Negative;0.6527429819107056;it was noted that higher wage growth had not been passed through to price inflation because firms had absorbed it by lowering profit margins and attention was drawn to the drop in gross operating surplus growth to practically zero in the third quarter of 2018 however it was argued that markups could not be squeezed indefinitely and that this effect would serve only to delay the passthrough of higher wages to consumer prices
2019-02-21;2019;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8390552997589111;more generally it was underlined that the transmission to consumer price inflation was subject to time lags and it appeared that more time and patience were needed
2019-02-21;2019;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9900050759315491;however it was also argued that more structural or longerlasting factors might still be at play for example related to changes in the competitive environment and to pressures on margins from ecommerce
2019-02-21;2019;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.577547550201416;as regards recent developments in longerterm inflation expectations members noted that both marketbased and surveybased measures had fallen since the previous monetary policy meeting of the governing council

2019-02-21;2019;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9950416684150696;concern was expressed that there might be a risk that this renewed weakness could start to weigh on inflation expectations if it were to persist
2019-02-21;2019;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8157984018325806;regarding fiscal policies the governing council reiterated the need to rebuild fiscal buffers
2019-02-21;2019;February;REPORT;Positive;0.7096041440963745;this was particularly important in countries where government debt was high and for which full adherence to the stability and growth pact was critical for safeguarding sound fiscal positions
2019-02-21;2019;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9846546649932861;with regard to the monetary analysis members widely shared the assessment provided by mr praet in his introduction
2019-02-21;2019;February;REPORT;Positive;0.5097664594650269;the annual growth rate of broad money m3 which had moderated somewhat in november 2018 continued to be underpinned by bank credit creation
2019-02-21;2019;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9766753315925598;the narrow monetary aggregate m1 remained the main contributor to broad money growth
2019-02-21;2019;February;REPORT;Negative;0.8201693892478943;reference was made to the results of the euro area bank lending survey for the fourth quarter of 2018 which showed that overall bank lending conditions had remained favourable in the euro area following an extended period of net easing while demand for bank credit had continued to rise
2019-02-21;2019;February;REPORT;Positive;0.8159581422805786;credit standards on loans to enterprises and households had tightened slightly mostly on account of developments in one large euro area economy that had been subject to financial market volatility and bank funding costs had also edged up
2019-02-21;2019;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9559635519981384;looking ahead it was felt that some consideration should be given to the outlook for liquidity conditions in the banking sector as the redemptions of outstanding targeted longerterm refinancing operations were approaching which might give rise to cliff effects

2019-02-21;2019;February;REPORT;Negative;0.99201500415802;there was broad agreement that the stance remained highly expansionary overall and that it had contributed to dampening the impact of prevailing uncertainties on financial conditions which remained favourable
2019-02-21;2019;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9944985508918762;it was remarked that alongside uncertainty about the external environment uncertainty regarding the euro area economy had risen recently  pertaining to both the growth outlook and inflation  owing to not only lower oil prices but also the slow passthrough from wages to prices
2019-02-21;2019;February;REPORT;Positive;0.989564061164856;there was broad agreement among members that supportive financing conditions favourable labour market dynamics and rising wage growth continued to underpin the euro area expansion thus supporting confidence in the convergence of inflation to the governing councils aim
2019-02-21;2019;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8437431454658508;while measures of underlying inflation remained muted labour cost pressures were strengthening further and were expected to pass through to underlying inflation in the period ahead
2019-02-21;2019;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9660018086433411;in this regard it was underlined that the euro area was still experiencing growth momentum with labour market conditions improving and lower oil prices supporting consumption
2019-02-21;2019;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9899954795837402;looking ahead a key question was seen to be the extent to which the weaker growth momentum might turn out to be more persistent than currently envisaged
2019-02-21;2019;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9785690307617188;more information including the march projections was needed to deepen the analysis and obtain greater clarity before conclusions could be drawn about the mediumterm inflation outlook
2019-02-21;2019;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9903422594070435;against this background all members agreed with the monetary policy considerations put forward by mr praet in his introduction
2019-02-21;2019;February;REPORT;Positive;0.6675825715065002;this entailed confirming the enhanced forward guidance on the path of the key ecb interest rates and on the reinvestments of acquired assets while acknowledging that the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook had moved to the downside on account of the persistence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors and the threat of protectionism
2019-02-21;2019;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.986846387386322;significant monetary policy stimulus would continue to be provided by the forward guidance on the key ecb interest rates and on the reinvestments of the sizeable stock of acquired assets
2019-02-21;2019;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9946034550666809;at the same time the governing council would reiterate that it stood ready to adjust all of its instruments as appropriate to ensure that inflation continued to move towards the governing councils inflation aim in a sustained manner
2019-02-21;2019;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.6918100714683533;members underlined that specifying the forward guidance on the governing councils policy instruments in terms of both a timebased leg and a statecontingent leg had served it well
2019-02-21;2019;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9526532292366028;the observation was made that in response to the recent weaker than expected data some easing in financial conditions had taken place through an outward shift in market expectations for the timing of a first rise in key ecb interest rates
2019-02-21;2019;February;REPORT;Positive;0.8181896209716797;this endogenous response was viewed as being consistent with the statebased elements of the governing councils forward guidance and contributed to preserving the financial conditions on which the projected inflation convergence remained contingent
2019-02-21;2019;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9924305081367493;the chained forward guidance on the key ecb interest rates and the reinvestments was seen as functioning as a kind of automatic stabiliser particularly in situations when further easing was deemed desirable in reaction to weaker than expected data
2019-02-21;2019;February;REPORT;Positive;0.8849602341651917;there was wide agreement that the continued convergence of inflation to the governing councils aim in the period ahead still required an ample degree of monetary accommodation

2019-02-21;2019;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9707995653152466;any potential new operations should reflect the monetary policy objectives to be achieved
2019-02-21;2019;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9871936440467834;while any decisions in this respect should not be taken too hastily the technical analyses required to prepare policy options for future liquidity operations needed to proceed swiftly

2019-02-21;2019;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9868272542953491;accordingly it was seen as appropriate to acknowledge that the incoming data had continued to be weaker than expected but that supportive financing conditions favourable labour market dynamics and rising wage growth continued to underpin the expansion and gradually rising inflation pressures in the euro area
2019-02-21;2019;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9924492835998535;at the same time it had to be recognised that the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook had moved to the downside on account of the persistence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors and the threat of protectionism vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility
2019-02-21;2019;February;REPORT;Negative;0.5805180668830872;in this regard the need to communicate cautiously was stressed in order to strike the right balance between credibility in acknowledging the weaker than expected data and conveying confidence in the adjustment towards the governing councils mediumterm inflation aim
2019-02-21;2019;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9934612512588501;consequently the governing council would reconfirm its forward guidance on the key ecb interest rates and on the reinvestment of the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme
2019-02-21;2019;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9883252382278442;members agreed that monetary policy needed to remain prudent patient and persistent and to continue to follow a datadriven approach in the period ahead

2019-02-21;2019;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9898882508277893;the governing council reiterated that it expected the key ecb interest rates to remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019 and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels below but close to 2 over the medium term
2019-02-21;2019;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9613502025604248;with regard to nonstandard monetary policy measures the governing council intended to continue reinvesting in full the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme for an extended period of time past the date when it started raising the key ecb interest rates and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation
