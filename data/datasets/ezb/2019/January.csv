2019-01-10;2019;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9930185675621033;any adjustment to the portfolio allocation across jurisdictions would be gradual and would be calibrated as appropriate to safeguard orderly market conditions

2019-01-10;2019;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9804091453552246;market capitalisation would continue to be the guiding principle for reinvestment purchases under these programmes while an adequate degree of flexibility in implementation would be needed for a smooth implementation

2019-01-10;2019;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.841601550579071;as regards the balance of risks on the one hand the view was expressed that a case could be made for assessing risks to activity as tilted to the downside
2019-01-10;2019;January;REPORT;Negative;0.995303750038147;prevailing uncertainty appeared to have affected confidence although the latter was coming down from high levels
2019-01-10;2019;January;REPORT;Negative;0.995381772518158;reference was made to a recent deterioration in business confidence with pmi survey data related to production and exports again disappointing
2019-01-10;2019;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9849457740783691;this was seen as affecting business investment and cautioned against being complacent about downside risks to growth
2019-01-10;2019;January;REPORT;Negative;0.6227346062660217;regarding the eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections it was noted that there had now been three successive downward revisions to the shortterm euro area baseline growth outlook over the past halfyear
2019-01-10;2019;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9921047687530518;the latest revisions essentially reflected the incorporation of new data regarding the short term but had no bearing on the growth path for the remainder of the projection horizon
2019-01-10;2019;January;REPORT;Negative;0.7221298813819885;therefore it was argued that unless all shocks affecting the latest figures were considered to be of a purely temporary nature this should have moved the balance of risks to the downside
2019-01-10;2019;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.6634622812271118;on the other hand it was argued that while there had recently been somewhat more negative news than positive news this had been incorporated in the downward revision to the baseline eurosystem staff projection such that the balance of risks pertaining to this new projection could be maintained as fairly balanced
2019-01-10;2019;January;REPORT;Positive;0.7108827233314514;it was also remarked that the assessment of still balanced risks to growth was supported by the emergence of new upside risks namely a further decline in oil prices since the cutoff date for the projections and the likelihood of more stimulus coming from fiscal measures
2019-01-10;2019;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9626767039299011;against this background caution was expressed against moving the balance of risks to the downside
2019-01-10;2019;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9935272336006165;all in all members concurred with the view that the risks to the euro area outlook could still be assessed as broadly balanced but that the balance of risks was moving to the downside owing to the persistence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors the threat of protectionism vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial volatility

2019-01-10;2019;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9694153666496277;a major downside risk to the inflation projections  but a probable upside risk to growth  related to oil prices which were presently lower than they had been when the projections were finalised
2019-01-10;2019;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9933075904846191;however it was argued that changes in oil prices could normally be expected to imply a risk mainly to the shorterterm outlook that diminished over the relevant mediumterm policy horizon while it was also remarked that geopolitical tensions could make the drop in oil prices more protracted
2019-01-10;2019;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.5266656279563904;some reassurance regarding the outlook for underlying inflation was drawn from recent developments in wage growth

2019-01-10;2019;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9880529642105103;members widely shared the view that the passthrough of wages to prices in particular in the services sector was a key factor underpinning confidence in the outlook for underlying inflation
2019-01-10;2019;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.5795700550079346;it was argued that the extent of the passthrough depended on the source of the shocks that were driving rising wage growth
2019-01-10;2019;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.7644187808036804;evidence suggested that the passthrough could be expected to be stronger if the source was a demand shock but more moderate in the case of other shocks
2019-01-10;2019;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.7474302053451538;the transmission of higher wages to consumer price inflation was subject to time lags and it appeared that more time and patience were needed
2019-01-10;2019;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9842297434806824;the argument was reiterated that the passthrough should eventually occur as rising wage growth with unchanged price inflation implied a squeeze in profit margins and markups that could not continue indefinitely
2019-01-10;2019;January;REPORT;Negative;0.874350905418396;with regard to inflation expectations marketbased measures of longerterm expectations had fallen somewhat from their levels at the time of the governing councils previous monetary policy meeting
2019-01-10;2019;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.6659186482429504;it was remarked that this could be due to the recent fall in oil prices since as also observed elsewhere there appeared to be a correlation between these two variables when oil prices were declining that was not observed symmetrically when oil prices were increasing
2019-01-10;2019;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9901883006095886;at the same time it was recalled that the risk of negative inflation rates and deflation had long faded

2019-01-10;2019;January;REPORT;Positive;0.8353437781333923;accordingly the governing council would state its intention to reinvest in full the principal payments from maturing securities for an extended period of time past the date of a first rise in interest rates and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation
2019-01-10;2019;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9907682538032532;there was broad agreement among members that the overall monetary policy stance remained highly expansionary and would remain so even after net asset purchases ceased at the end of 2018 while the app was transitioning into a phase of zero net asset purchases the eurosystem would continue to make purchases under the programme in line with the governing councils enhanced forward guidance on reinvestments
2019-01-10;2019;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9482300281524658;owing to the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the reinvestment of maturing principal as well as the governing councils forward guidance on interest rates ample monetary policy accommodation remained in place
2019-01-10;2019;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.6654208898544312;the enhanced forward guidance on reinvestments would adequately convey the governing councils intention to continue to fully reinvest maturing principal repayments over an extended period of time past the date of a first rise in the key ecb interest rates
2019-01-10;2019;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9861264824867249;there was broad agreement among members that expressing the time dimension of the reinvestment guidance in terms of an extended period past the date when the governing council starts raising the key ecb interest rates struck an appropriate balance between giving additional guidance on reinvestments and maintaining flexibility and optionality for the period ahead
2019-01-10;2019;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9903767704963684;furthermore linking the reinvestment horizon to the interest rate liftoff was seen as signalling that the governing councils policy rate guidance was the primary tool for adjusting the monetary policy stance in the period ahead
