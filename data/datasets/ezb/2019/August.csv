2019-08-22;2019;August;REPORT;Negative;0.8450842499732971;regarding longerterm inflation expectations members widely shared the view that the recent declines were a matter of concern which warranted close monitoring
2019-08-22;2019;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9799484014511108;it was stressed that declines were no longer visible only in the marketbased indicators but were now also apparent in surveybased indicators which had fallen to historical lows
2019-08-22;2019;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.8191814422607422;the point was made that it mattered how influential inflation expectations from financial markets and professional forecasters were in shaping those of other economic agents
2019-08-22;2019;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9833799004554749;available information suggested that the expectations of financial market participants or professional forecasters differed from those of households and firms
2019-08-22;2019;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9073864221572876;it was also noted that the difference between the low levels of marketbased measures and the higher levels of surveybased measures could be explained by a negative risk premium but it was also argued that the negative risk premium might itself be of concern if it reflected hedging against outcomes of very low inflation or deflation and therefore provided no grounds for complacency
2019-08-22;2019;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9851697087287903;with regard to the monetary analysis members widely shared the assessment provided by mr lane in his introduction
2019-08-22;2019;August;REPORT;Negative;0.8485285043716431;the annual growth rate of broad money m3 had been 45 in june down from 48 in may reflecting a negative base effect
2019-08-22;2019;August;REPORT;Positive;0.9884896874427795;the sustained rates of broad money growth were supported by ongoing bank credit creation for the private sector and low opportunity costs of holding m3
2019-08-22;2019;August;REPORT;Positive;0.931097686290741;the narrow monetary aggregate m1 continued to be the main contributor to broad money growth on the components side
2019-08-22;2019;August;REPORT;Positive;0.9870397448539734;lending to the nonfinancial private sector was expanding at a robust pace with unchanged annual growth rates of 38 for loans to nfcs and 33 for loans to households in june
2019-08-22;2019;August;REPORT;Positive;0.991790771484375;overall loan growth continued to benefit from historically low bank lending rates
2019-08-22;2019;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9896844625473022;members also agreed that the ecbs monetary policy measures continued to support loan growth and ultimately real activity and inflation
2019-08-22;2019;August;REPORT;Positive;0.9873962998390198;the euro area bank lending survey for the second quarter of 2019 indicated that loan growth continued to be supported by increasing demand across all loan categories
2019-08-22;2019;August;REPORT;Negative;0.994644045829773;at the same time credit standards for loans to enterprises had tightened in the second quarter amid concerns about the economic outlook while they had remained broadly unchanged for loans for house purchase
2019-08-22;2019;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9945405125617981;a remark was made that negative interest rates were increasing the pressure on the banking sector particularly in countries where banks were not able to impose negative rates on deposits
2019-08-22;2019;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9842891097068787;consequently the longerterm effects of negative policy rates needed to be monitored carefully to ensure that they exerted their intended effect on bank lending
2019-08-22;2019;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9883755445480347;monetary policy stance and policy considerations with regard to the monetary policy stance members widely shared the assessment provided by mr lane in his introduction
2019-08-22;2019;August;REPORT;Positive;0.8977948427200317;overall financial conditions had eased since the governing councils june monetary policy meeting largely on account of market expectations of further monetary policy easing
2019-08-22;2019;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9710973501205444;bank lending conditions for firms and households remained very favourable
2019-08-22;2019;August;REPORT;Positive;0.9629759788513184;an ample degree of monetary accommodation remained necessary for financial conditions to support the euro area expansion the ongoing buildup of domestic price pressures and thus headline inflation developments over the medium term
2019-08-22;2019;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9849581718444824;members shared the assessment that information available since the early june governing council meeting indicated that while further employment gains and increasing wages continued to underpin the resilience of the economy softening global growth dynamics and weak international trade were still weighing on the euro area outlook
2019-08-22;2019;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9934224486351013;the prolonged presence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors the rising threat of protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets continued to dampen economic sentiment notably in the manufacturing sector
2019-08-22;2019;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9595041275024414;it was noted that while recent data were broadly in line with the baseline scenario and the forces underlying the baseline  such as solid wage growth and rising cost pressures  were still seen as intact the uncertainty around the projected duration of the economic slowdown remained high also affecting the mediumterm inflation outlook
2019-08-22;2019;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9939437508583069;in this environment inflationary pressures had remained muted and indicators of inflation expectations had declined
2019-08-22;2019;August;REPORT;Negative;0.992327868938446;despite the considerable divergence in the levels of different surveybased and marketbased measures of mediumterm inflation expectations and the observation that marketbased measures may have been affected by special factors broad agreement prevailed that the overall downward movement across indicators was a cause for concern from a monetary policy perspective
2019-08-22;2019;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9543196558952332;against the background of inflation rates both realised and projected remaining persistently below levels that were in line with the governing councils inflation aim members widely agreed with the assessment that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy was needed for a prolonged period of time
2019-08-22;2019;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.8713316917419434;in this context confirming the symmetry of the governing councils mediumterm inflation aim was seen as an important element to bolster the achievement of a sustained adjustment in inflation to its aim
2019-08-22;2019;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.989371657371521;a remark was made that so far the interaction between the inflation aim and the governing councils definition of price stability as an inflation rate of below 2 introduced de facto an element of asymmetry
2019-08-22;2019;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9934067726135254;a view was put forward that a discussion of symmetry around the inflation aim could not be separated from a discussion about the level of this aim while the point was made that any future change in the inflation aim should not be employed as an isolated policy measure but should be linked to a broader review of the ecbs monetary policy strategy to ensure consistency of the strategy
2019-08-22;2019;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9863681197166443;at the same time the point was made that a clarification of the symmetric nature of the governing councils reaction function would not preempt a full review of the monetary policy strategy at a later point in time
2019-08-22;2019;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9869446158409119;members expressed broad agreement with the monetary policy proposals made by mr lane in his introduction first to adjust the forward guidance on the key ecb interest rates by reintroducing an easing bias and second to initiate preparatory work including on ways to strengthen the governing councils forward guidance on policy rates mitigating measures such as the design of a tiered system for reserve remuneration and options for the size and composition of potential new net asset purchases
2019-08-22;2019;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.991998016834259;it was seen as important for the governing council to demonstrate its determination and capacity to act and to be prepared to ease the policy stance further by adjusting all of its instruments as appropriate to achieve its inflation aim
2019-08-22;2019;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9908466935157776;looking ahead more information would be available at the governing councils monetary policy meeting in september when new projections incorporating the effects of the measures taken at the governing councils june meeting would be presented
2019-08-22;2019;August;REPORT;Negative;0.7662519812583923;members broadly supported the reintroduction of an easing bias to the governing councils forward guidance on interest rates in the light of the weakness of the economic outlook and the muted inflation developments
2019-08-22;2019;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.8856844305992126;the easing bias was considered appropriate for addressing the risk of an unwarranted tightening of monetary conditions related to the short end of the yield curve in view of the persistent uncertainty surrounding global developments
2019-08-22;2019;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9927507638931274;members also broadly supported the proposal made by mr lane to task the relevant eurosystem committees with examining options for future policy measures
2019-08-22;2019;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9888120889663696;some nuances were expressed about the design and the individual elements of a possible policy package which was presented as a list of options
2019-08-22;2019;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9815196990966797;in particular it was argued that the term premium on longterm euro area bonds had already been compressed for quite some time and that the risk of an unwarranted tightening of financial conditions was higher at the short end than at the long end of the yield curve
2019-08-22;2019;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9902946949005127;however the view was expressed that the various options should be seen as a package ie
2019-08-22;2019;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.754854142665863;a combination of instruments with significant complementarities and synergies since experience had shown that a policy package  such as the combination of rate cuts and asset purchases  was more effective than a sequence of selective actions
2019-08-22;2019;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9930847883224487;the point was made that the choice of instruments and the design of a possible package should reflect the relative effectiveness of different instruments in addressing future contingencies
2019-08-22;2019;August;REPORT;Positive;0.9301541447639465;members saw value in examining ways to further strengthen the statebased component of the forward guidance on the path of policy rates announcing preparatory work on the design of a tiered system or other options to mitigate the effects of negative interest rates on bankbased intermediation and preparatory work on modalities for potential new net asset purchases
2019-08-22;2019;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.988807201385498;in this context it was also argued that linking the statecontingent leg of the forward guidance to inflation would require attention being paid to consistency with the inflation aim
2019-08-22;2019;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9913813471794128;while members expressed broad agreement with initiating preparatory work on mitigating measures some concerns were raised regarding possible unintended consequences of a tiered system and its ability to fully mitigate the potential effects of negative policy rates on bank intermediation
2019-08-22;2019;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9576252698898315;against this background communication needed to strike a careful balance between on the one hand giving unduly negative signals about the state of the economy and on the other hand effectively counteracting the concern among some observers that the governing council lacked the necessary instruments to secure the convergence of inflation to its inflation aim over the medium term
2019-08-22;2019;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9905067086219788;it was therefore seen as appropriate for the governing council to adjust its forward guidance on the key ecb interest rates namely that it now expected them to remain at their present or lower levels at least through the first half of 2020 and in any case for as long as necessary while restating its forward guidance on reinvestments
2019-08-22;2019;August;REPORT;Negative;0.5031155943870544;moreover the governing council should underline the need for a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy for a prolonged period of time as inflation rates both realised and projected had been persistently below levels that were in line with its aim

2019-08-22;2019;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.9934072494506836;it therefore remained essential to underscore that the governing council stood ready to adjust all of its instruments as appropriate to ensure that inflation moved towards its inflation aim in a sustained manner

2019-08-22;2019;August;REPORT;Negative;0.9324778318405151;in addition as heightened uncertainty was likely to extend further into the future it remained essential to stress that a significant degree of monetary stimulus continued to be necessary to ensure that financial conditions remained very favourable and supported the euro area expansion the ongoing buildup of domestic price pressures and thus headline inflation developments over the medium term
2019-08-22;2019;August;REPORT;Neutral;0.8588451743125916;finally it was recalled that in the current situation monetary policy would be more effective if other policy areas contributed to raising the longerterm growth potential
