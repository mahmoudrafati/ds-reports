2019-07-11;2019;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9821934700012207;mr lane therefore saw the need to update the monetary policy stance to provide the monetary accommodation necessary for inflation to remain on a sustained path towards levels that were below but close to 2 over the medium term
2019-07-11;2019;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9906057715415955;accordingly he proposed the following adjustments first to extend the calendar element of the ecbs forward guidance on the path of interest rates to at least through the first half of 2020 second to confirm the forward guidance on reinvestment and third based on the assessment of the bankbased transmission channel of monetary policy and the developments in the economic outlook to set the interest rate of the upcoming series of targeted longerterm refinancing operations tltro iii equal to the average rate on the main refinancing operations mro plus 10 basis points over the life of the respective operation and as low as the average deposit facility rate plus 10 basis points for those banks whose eligible net lending exceeded a benchmark
2019-07-11;2019;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9012992978096008;this struck a reasonable balance between acknowledging the sound developments in bank lending and the importance of preserving the accommodative stance

2019-07-11;2019;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9147539138793945;possible measures could include extending forward guidance further restarting net asset purchases and decreasing policy rates
2019-07-11;2019;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9355002045631409;in addition following on from what had been communicated in april 2019 the governing council could indicate that at the current point in time the positive contribution of negative interest rates to the accommodative monetary policy stance and to the sustained convergence of inflation was not undermined by possible side effects on bankbased intermediation
2019-07-11;2019;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9872139692306519;however the governing council should continue to monitor carefully the bankbased transmission channel of monetary policy and the case for mitigating measures

2019-07-11;2019;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9855820536613464;this assessment was also broadly reflected in the june 2019 eurosystem staff projections which foresaw annual hicp inflation at 13 in 2019 14 in 2020 and 16 in 2021 compared with the march 2019 ecb staff projections the outlook for hicp inflation had been revised up by 01 percentage points for 2019 and revised down by 01 percentage points for 2020 confidence in the upward movement in the path of inflation was expressed and it was underlined that the recent pronounced volatility in inflation data should be temporary and had in significant measure been due to the timing of public holidays and to methodological changes regarding seasonal adjustment in the euro areas largest economy
2019-07-11;2019;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.988983690738678;reference was made to the downward shift in the optionimplied distribution of inflation expectations
2019-07-11;2019;July;REPORT;Negative;0.8760956525802612;the fiveyear forward inflationlinked swap rate five years ahead had fallen back to levels near the previous lows recorded in september 2016 at the same time it was recalled that while technical factors might affect the information content of marketbased measures of inflation expectations and while no such strong deterioration could be detected in other measures notably surveys there should be no room for complacency
2019-07-11;2019;July;REPORT;Negative;0.4120526909828186;with unit labour costs expected to decelerate somewhat over the projection horizon as productivity gains outpaced wage growth increasing profit margins were seen as the main factor behind rising inflation in the projections
2019-07-11;2019;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9617809057235718;however it was argued that stronger profit margins might not materialise in an environment of decelerating domestic demand and in the presence of substantial cash buffers held by companies which could be used to accommodate shocks in uncertain conditions
2019-07-11;2019;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8879514336585999;hence the passthrough from wages to prices might not be observed for some time
2019-07-11;2019;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9842617511749268;however it was also underlined that while the limited passthrough from wages to prices remained a puzzle and there were uncertainties and lags in the relationship the fundamental economic forces remained in place for inflation to pick up over time
2019-07-11;2019;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9851697087287903;with regard to the monetary analysis members widely shared the assessment provided by mr lane in his introduction
2019-07-11;2019;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9019159078598022;the sustained rates of broad money growth were seen to reflect ongoing bank credit creation for the private sector and low opportunity costs of holding m3
2019-07-11;2019;July;REPORT;Positive;0.931097686290741;the narrow monetary aggregate m1 continued to be the main contributor to broad money growth on the components side
2019-07-11;2019;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9873700141906738;on the counterparts side lending to the nonfinancial private sector had remained robust overall and continued to be supported by very favourable borrowing costs for firms and households across the euro area which remained close to their historical lows
2019-07-11;2019;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9753492474555969;members also broadly shared the assessment that at current levels the ecbs negative interest rate policy continued to support loan growth and ultimately economic growth and inflation
2019-07-11;2019;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8492724299430847;the immediate costs of the negative interest rate policy arising from banks paying a negative rate on their excess reserves and deposit facility holdings were considered to be overall limited in size
2019-07-11;2019;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9005664587020874;so far these costs were outweighed by the overall benefits from the generation of larger lending volumes and the reduction of risks and loan loss provisions due to the more favourable macroeconomic developments fostered by negative interest rates
2019-07-11;2019;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8994242548942566;the point was made that such findings warranted further analysis and that this assessment might not hold for lower policy rates or for horizons longer than those currently envisaged in the governing councils forward guidance

2019-07-11;2019;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9818354845046997;overall financial conditions had tightened marginally since the governing councils april monetary policy meeting largely on account of the renewed escalation of trade tensions
2019-07-11;2019;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9893683791160583;at the same time bank lending conditions for firms and households remained very favourable
2019-07-11;2019;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9679930210113525;while further employment gains and rising wages still underpinned the resilience of the domestic economy and gradually rising inflation pressures an ample degree of monetary accommodation remained necessary to support the euro area expansion the ongoing buildup of domestic price pressures and thus headline inflation developments over the medium term
2019-07-11;2019;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9868396520614624;there was also broad agreement with the assessment that an update of the monetary policy stance was called for in the light of the prolongation of uncertainties and their implications for the inflation outlook
2019-07-11;2019;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8808314204216003;confidence in the baseline projection and a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation continued to be warranted but inflation was still projected to reach only 16 in 2021 which was seen to remain some distance away from the governing councils inflation aim
2019-07-11;2019;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9908336997032166;it was hence considered important for the governing council to demonstrate its determination to act in line with its reaction function by adjusting its monetary policy stance at the current meeting and to further prepare for adverse contingencies in the period ahead
2019-07-11;2019;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9932918548583984;against this background members expressed broad agreement with the overall package of monetary policy proposals put forward by mr lane in his introduction first to adjust the calendarbased component of the governing councils forward guidance on the key ecb interest rates to indicate that the governing council now expected rates to remain at their present levels at least through the first half of 2020 second to reiterate the governing councils forward guidance on reinvestment and third based on the assessment of the bankbased transmission channel of monetary policy and the developments in the economic outlook to set the interest rate on the forthcoming tltro iii operations equal to the average mro rate plus 10 basis points over the life of the respective operation and as low as the average deposit facility rate plus 10 basis points for those banks whose eligible net lending exceeded a benchmark
2019-07-11;2019;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9742259979248047;at the same time some nuances were expressed about individual elements of the policy package
2019-07-11;2019;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9678159952163696;responding to the further weakening of the economic outlook and the muted inflation developments in the context of prolonged uncertainties the extension of the calendar element of the forward guidance on interest rates was widely seen as appropriate
2019-07-11;2019;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9837732315063477;the point was made that if the calendarbased component was progressively aligned with market expectations in response to changes in the macroeconomic environment the independent value of the calendar element could be seen to be diminished
2019-07-11;2019;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9907537698745728;the forward guidance on the interest rate path nonetheless remained the principal instrument for adjusting the monetary policy stance and had proved effective
2019-07-11;2019;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9898499250411987;moreover the extension of the calendarbased component by six months was seen to be in line with a gradual approach to adjusting policy which would allow monitoring in the period ahead to see whether the observed prolonged soft patch proved to be persistent
2019-07-11;2019;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9743037223815918;in addition it was underlined that the statecontingent element embodied a powerful automatic stabiliser as indicated by the very substantial downward shift in the entire interest rate swap curve since the beginning of the year
2019-07-11;2019;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9241829514503479;with regard to the pricing of the tltro iii operations members widely supported the proposal made by mr lane and agreed with his assessment that this struck a reasonable balance between acknowledging the solid developments in bank lending and the importance of preserving the ecbs accommodative monetary policy stance
2019-07-11;2019;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.6148809194564819;the pricing of a minimum rate at the deposit facility rate plus 10 basis points was widely seen as very favourable and maximising the policy effectiveness of the forthcoming operations
2019-07-11;2019;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9116949439048767;some arguments were made in favour of a pricing more in line with that of tltro ii
2019-07-11;2019;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9325829744338989;this was seen as making the contribution of tltro iii to the monetary policy stance even stronger
2019-07-11;2019;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9825782179832458;at the same time it was acknowledged that bank lending was overall much stronger now than had been the case when tltro ii was announced
2019-07-11;2019;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9338581562042236;in the context of their regular assessment members also broadly shared mr lanes assessment in his introduction that at the current point in time the positive contribution of negative interest rates to the accommodative monetary policy stance and to the sustained convergence of inflation was not undermined by possible side effects on bankbased intermediation
2019-07-11;2019;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9831647872924805;at the same time there was also broad agreement that the governing council should continue to monitor carefully the bankbased transmission channel and the case for mitigating measures
2019-07-11;2019;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9772235155105591;in this context it was underlined that the possible side effects of a low interest rate environment would also need to be addressed by adequate macroprudential policies
2019-07-11;2019;July;REPORT;Positive;0.6890674829483032;a call was therefore made to strengthen the effectiveness of macroprudential frameworks and prudential tools to address possible financial stability risks arising from rates remaining at very low levels over a prolonged horizon
2019-07-11;2019;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9934617280960083;against this background the president ascertained that all members agreed with the overall package of monetary policy proposals put forward by mr lane in his introduction which was seen as appropriate in the current economic environment to provide the monetary accommodation necessary for inflation to remain on a sustained path towards levels below but close to 2 over the medium term
2019-07-11;2019;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9601373672485352;at the same time there was broad agreement that in the light of the heightened uncertainty which was likely to extend further into the future the governing council needed to be ready and prepared to ease the monetary policy stance further by adjusting all of its instruments as appropriate to achieve its price stability objective
2019-07-11;2019;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9535725116729736;potential measures to be considered included the possibility of further extending and strengthening the governing councils forward guidance resuming net asset purchases and decreasing policy rates
2019-07-11;2019;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9361507296562195;in this context it was also noted that should the environment of too low inflation continue to prevail considerations of a more strategic nature might be warranted in order to reinforce the credibility of the ecbs monetary policy and support the achievement of a sustained adjustment in inflation to its inflation aim
2019-07-11;2019;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9924851059913635;the point was made that the governing councils communication should put more emphasis on the symmetry of its mediumterm aim by clarifying that deviations of inflation from the governing councils inflation aim would be tolerated in a symmetrical fashion in both directions as long as this supported the achievement of the governing councils inflation aim in a sustained manner over the medium term
2019-07-11;2019;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.7063902020454407;at the same time the point was made that care needed to be taken to ensure that any considerations of a strategic nature could not be seen as moving the goalposts at a time when it proved challenging to achieve the governing councils inflation aim
2019-07-11;2019;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9935344457626343;monetary policy decisions and communication taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members on a proposal from the president the governing council decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility would remain unchanged at 000 025 and 040 respectively
2019-07-11;2019;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9906013011932373;the governing council expected the key ecb interest rates to remain at their present levels at least through the first half of 2020 and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels below but close to 2 over the medium term
2019-07-11;2019;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9748100638389587;the governing council intended to continue reinvesting in full the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme for an extended period of time past the date when it started raising the key ecb interest rates and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation
2019-07-11;2019;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9928340911865234;regarding the modalities of the new series of quarterly tltros the governing council decided that the interest rate in each operation would be set at a level that is 10 basis points above the average rate applied in the eurosystems main refinancing operations over the life of the respective tltro
2019-07-11;2019;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.6027663946151733;for banks whose eligible net lending were to exceed a benchmark the rate applied in tltro iii would be lower and could be as low as the average interest rate on the deposit facility prevailing over the life of the operation plus 10 basis points
2019-07-11;2019;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9822641015052795;further modalities would be set out in a technical press release to be published at the end of the press conference
