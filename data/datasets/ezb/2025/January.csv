2025-01-16;2025;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9817963242530823;moreover if the economy did not pick up the risk that inflation could undershoot the target would increase
2025-01-16;2025;January;REPORT;Negative;0.90496826171875;this suggested that monetary policy might become too restrictive with interest rates still some distance from a neutral level
2025-01-16;2025;January;REPORT;Negative;0.8876776695251465;in this context the need to signal the governing councils commitment to the symmetric target was stressed as well as the need to remain vigilant to prevent the materialisation of both upside and downside risks to inflationat the same time members widely concurred that a 25 basis point cut was appropriate in light of the gradual but not complete progress made towards returning inflation to 2 on a sustained basis and in view of the prevailing risks and uncertainties
2025-01-16;2025;January;REPORT;Negative;0.6123842000961304;in this respect it was pointed out that if as reflected in the staff projections the economy was to expand at a pace around its potential growth in the coming years inflation should neither overshoot nor undershoot the 2 target materially
2025-01-16;2025;January;REPORT;Negative;0.6649221777915955;it was also underlined that in any case the ecb had a single mandate of price stability not a dual mandate and since the disinflation process had not yet been concluded it was too early to cut rates by a larger amount
2025-01-16;2025;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9833831191062927;moreover it was remarked that a 50 basis point cut could be perceived as the ecb having a more negative view of the state of the economy than was actually the case
2025-01-16;2025;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.8169093132019043;this was not desirable unless warranted by additional negative shocks
2025-01-16;2025;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9867892861366272;furthermore it had to be kept in mind that with the rate cut decided at the october meeting the governing council had already demonstrated its commitment to react to a worsening macroeconomic outlook associated with a weakening of inflationary pressures by increasing the speed of interest rate adjustmentsthe point was also made that the frequency of price adjustments was likely lower in a situation of weak growth or when facing negative shocks implying a flatter phillips curve
2025-01-16;2025;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9820541143417358;this meant that the case for adjusting interest rates by 50 basis points was not the same on the way down as it had been during the ratehiking cycle
2025-01-16;2025;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9838554263114929;similarly any unanchoring of inflation expectations was likely to be less rapid on the way down although it could be more persistent owing to the lower bound on interest rates
2025-01-16;2025;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9826342463493347;therefore a significant worsening of the growth outlook under a flat phillips curve might not necessarily trigger a steep decline in inflation implying that the downside risks to inflation were not very large
2025-01-16;2025;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9398982524871826;this reasoning should not rule out more decisive action in adverse scenarios or in the event that the phillips curve were to become steeper
2025-01-16;2025;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9923241138458252;members also pointed out that a significant part of the economic slowdown was likely attributable to structural factors that monetary policy could not address and which needed to be addressed by governments
2025-01-16;2025;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9664085507392883;only part of the economic slowdown was seen as cyclical and in these conditions accommodative monetary policy would be unable to boost potential growth if for structural reasons firms did not wish to invest
2025-01-16;2025;January;REPORT;Positive;0.8948750495910645;however it was argued that a faster normalisation of monetary policy aimed at running the economy at potential would provide more room for governments to address structural problems
2025-01-16;2025;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9884572625160217;at the same time monetary policy was ineffective in resolving structural weaknesses
2025-01-16;2025;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.8629578351974487;it could not take on responsibility for longterm growth which was rather the responsibility of governments
2025-01-16;2025;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9857392907142639;the best contribution that monetary policy could make was to provide price stability and thereby remove a major source of uncertaintymembers also argued in favour of maintaining a datadependent and meetingbymeeting approach to determining the appropriate level of policy rates taking into account transmission lags and emphasising that data dependency did not mean only looking backwards at past data but also forwards at the mediumterm outlook
2025-01-16;2025;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9847372174263;it was remarked that data dependency implied taking an analytical approach using not just hard data and survey indicators but also economic models and judgement to project trends in inflation dynamics and assess the risks surrounding the outlookturning to communication aspects members supported the proposed change in the wording of the monetary policy statement that removed the tightening bias by replacing the intention to remain sufficiently restrictive with a more twosided pledge to adopt the appropriate stance to ensure that inflation stabilises sustainably at our 2 mediumterm target
2025-01-16;2025;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9420582056045532;this change in the communication was seen as reinforcing the rate cut
2025-01-16;2025;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9855380058288574;overall members concluded that the proposed changes to the communication struck a fine balance between removing the reference to maintaining monetary policy restrictiveness while avoiding sending a signal that the path of rate adjustments was preset
2025-01-16;2025;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9909018278121948;in this context the change in the communication was seen as an adjustment to better reflect the ecbs reaction function in view of the latest circumstances rather than being a change in the way monetary policy was conductedmembers also agreed with the proposal by mr lane for reinvestments of the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the pandemic emergency purchase programme pepp to cease at the end of 2024 in line with the governing councils intention expressed at its meeting in june 2024 moreover members highlighted that in december 2024 banks would repay the remaining amounts borrowed under the targeted longerterm refinancing operations which concluded this part of the balance sheet normalisation processtaking into account the foregoing discussion among the members upon a proposal by the president the governing council took the monetary policy decisions as set out in the monetary policy press release
2025-01-16;2025;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9893711805343628;the members of the governing council subsequently finalised the monetary policy statement which the president and the vicepresident would as usual deliver at the press conference following the governing council meeting
