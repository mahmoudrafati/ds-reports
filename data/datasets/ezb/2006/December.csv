2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9895167946815491;at todays meeting we decided to increase the key ecb interest rates by 25 basis points
2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9543355703353882;this decision reflects the upside risks to price stability over the medium term that we have identified through both our economic and monetary analyses
2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9630575776100159;todays decision will contribute to ensuring that medium to longerterm inflation expectations in the euro area remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability
2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.6657304763793945;such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting sustainable economic growth and job creation in the euro area
2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9895115494728088;after todays increase our monetary policy continues to be accommodative with the key ecb interest rates remaining at low levels money and credit growth strong and liquidity in the euro area ample by all plausible measures
2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.8964850902557373;therefore looking ahead acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term is warranted
2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9793334603309631;the governing council will monitor very closely all developments so that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise
2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9766771793365479;turning first to the economic analysis according to eurostats first estimate the quarteronquarter growth rate of real gdp in the euro area for the third quarter of 2006 was 05
2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9900582432746887;the data thus confirm our assessment that economic activity continued to expand robustly while moderating from the very strong rates seen in the first half of the year
2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Positive;0.985031008720398;domestic demand remained the main driver of economic growth in the third quarter confirming the anticipated broadening of the recovery and pointing to the increasingly selfsustaining nature of economic expansion in the euro area
2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9919338226318359;the information on economic activity from various confidence surveys and indicatorbased estimates supports the assessment that robust economic growth has continued in the fourth quarter of this year
2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9918556213378906;looking ahead the conditions remain in place for the euro area economy to grow at solid rates around potential
2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Negative;0.9566503763198853;while some volatility in the quarterly growth rates is likely to emerge around the turn of the year associated with the impact of changes in indirect taxes in a large euro area country the mediumterm outlook for economic activity remains favourable
2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.8896849155426025;as regards the external environment economic growth has become more balanced across regions
2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9914735555648804;helped in part by lower oil prices global growth is robust thereby providing support for euro area exports
2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9922775030136108;domestic demand in the euro area is expected to maintain its relatively strong momentum
2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Positive;0.990932822227478;investment should remain dynamic benefiting from an extended period of very favourable financing conditions balance sheet restructuring accumulated and ongoing strong earnings and gains in business efficiency
2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9929327964782715;consumption should also strengthen further over time in line with developments in real disposable income as employment conditions continue to improve
2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9728325009346008;this outlook is also reflected in the new eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections
2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9863083958625793;the projections foresee average annual real gdp growth in a range between 25 and 29 in 2006 between 17 and 27 in 2007 and between 18 and 28 in 2008 most recent forecasts by international organisations give a broadly similar picture
2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.940552830696106;in comparison with the september ecb staff projections the ranges projected for real gdp growth in 2006 and 2007 have been revised upwards largely reflecting the assumption of lower energy prices and their impact on real disposable income
2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Negative;0.9827831983566284;in the governing councils view the risks surrounding this broadly favourable outlook for economic growth over the projection horizon lie on the downside
2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Negative;0.9877420663833618;the main risks relate to the possibility of a renewed increase in oil prices fears of a rise in protectionist pressures especially after the suspension of the doha round of trade talks and concerns about possible disorderly developments owing to global imbalances
2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9877871870994568;as regards price developments according to eurostats flash estimate annual hicp inflation rose to 18 in november 2006 from 16 in october and 17 in september
2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Negative;0.9392431378364563;while no detailed breakdown of the november hicp data is available as of yet the lower annual hicp inflation rates recorded in the two previous months reflected mainly the significant declines in crude oil prices from august onwards as well as base effects
2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9099533557891846;while the outlook for energy prices remains uncertain on the basis of the oil prices currently implied by the futures market overall inflation rates are likely to increase again in early 2007 and then hover around 2 in the course of that year also reflecting the impact of higher indirect taxes
2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9910805821418762;the december eurosystem staff projections see annual hicp inflation at between 21 and 23 in 2006 between 15 and 25 in 2007 and between 13 and 25 in 2008 most recent forecasts by international organisations give a broadly similar picture
2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Negative;0.9655089378356934;compared with the september 2006 ecb staff projections the ranges for 2006 and 2007 are somewhat lower largely reflecting the assumption of lower energy prices
2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9366747736930847;in this context let me remind you of the conditional nature of these projections which are based on a series of technical assumptions including market expectations for short and longterm interest rates as well as for oil and nonenergy commodity prices
2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Positive;0.984790027141571;in the governing councils view the outlook for price developments remains subject to upside risks stemming in particular from a passthrough of previous oil price increases which is stronger than assumed in the baseline scenario the possibility of renewed oil price increases and additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those announced and decided thus far
2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9913449287414551;more fundamentally given the favourable momentum of real gdp growth observed over the past few quarters and the positive signs from labour markets wage developments could be stronger than currently expected
2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Negative;0.36587902903556824;therefore it is crucial that the social partners continue to meet their responsibilities
2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9511120915412903;wage agreements should take into account productivity developments in connection with the still high level of unemployment and positions in price competitiveness
2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.928514838218689;it is also important that wage settlements move away from automatic backwardlooking indexation mechanisms
2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9766536355018616;turning to the monetary analysis annual m3 growth was unchanged at 85 in october remaining close to the highest rates observed since the introduction of the euro which points to inflationary risks at medium to longer horizons
2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.7532923817634583;increasing interest rates have exerted some influence over monetary developments in recent months although as yet mainly by triggering shifts among the components of m3 rather than constraining the expansion of m3 itself
2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Negative;0.8966221809387207;in particular the annual growth rate of m1 has moderated somewhat reflecting shifts from overnight deposits into other components of m3 which offer more marketrelated returns
2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9879516959190369;more generally the rate of monetary and credit expansion remains rapid reflecting the low level of interest rates and the strengthening of economic activity in the euro area
2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.6300438046455383;in particular loans to the private sector continue to grow at doubledigit rates on an annual basis their dynamism remaining broadly based across the household and corporate sectors
2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Negative;0.4920198619365692;in the context of rising interest rates the growth of household borrowing has shown signs of stabilisation in recent months albeit at very high growth rates
2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Positive;0.8796960115432739;by contrast the growth of borrowing by nonfinancial corporations continues to trend upwards and has now reached rates of over 12 on an annual basis the highest seen since the early 1990s
2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Positive;0.980534017086029;thus when the counterparts of m3 are considered the main driver of strong monetary growth remains the expansion of credit to the private sector
2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.7337425947189331;taking a medium to longerterm perspective the latest developments are consistent with a continuation of the persistent upward trend in the underlying rate of monetary expansion identified by the ecbs monetary analysis since mid2004
2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9239153265953064;furthermore following several years of robust monetary growth the liquidity situation in the euro area is ample by all plausible measures
2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9854577779769897;continued strong monetary and credit growth in an environment of ample liquidity point to upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term
2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9918150305747986;monetary developments therefore continue to require very careful monitoring particularly against the background of improved economic conditions and continued strong property market developments in many parts of the euro area
2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Negative;0.9175236821174622;to sum up annual inflation rates are projected to hover around 2 in the coming two years with risks to this outlook remaining on the upside
2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Positive;0.4423421621322632;in addition given the ongoing marked dynamism of monetary and credit growth in an environment of ample liquidity a crosscheck of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis supports the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium to long term
2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.7161976099014282;it is essential that inflation expectations remain firmly anchored at levels consistent with price stability
2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9117677807807922;indeed acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term is warranted
2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9758284687995911;the governing council will therefore monitor very closely all developments so that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise
2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.880443274974823;as regards fiscal policy the european commissions autumn forecasts suggest that deficits will fall below 3 of gdp in most euro area countries by 2007 this is welcome
2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9893330335617065;however the projected improvements in fiscal balances can only partly be attributed to substantial progress in structural consolidation as higher economic growth and revenue windfalls are playing an important role
2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Negative;0.863921582698822;moreover in a number of countries with fiscal imbalances adjustment efforts still fall short of what is needed to meet their respective mediumterm objectives in a timely manner and thus fulfil the requirements of the revised stability and growth pact
2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Negative;0.9545840620994568;this is of major concern
2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9779934883117676;it is therefore crucial that forthcoming updates of the stability programmes not only envisage significant progress towards the correction of excessive deficits in a sustainable manner but also make sufficient headway towards safe budgetary positions in the countries concerned
2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.538705587387085;for all countries it is paramount that procyclical policies be avoided in the current economic upswing
2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Positive;0.914422869682312;more progress is also needed with fiscal structural reform as part of a comprehensive mediumterm strategy to improve economic incentives and the soundness of social security systems
2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9815111756324768;this would be a crucial contribution of fiscal policies to economic growth and fiscal sustainability as well as to confidence in the revised stability and growth pact
2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9598860144615173;as regards structural reforms the governing council welcomed the 2006 progress reports submitted by eu member states on their 200508 national reform programmes in line with the renewed lisbon strategy
2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Positive;0.6961400508880615;although it is encouraging that many concrete reform steps are being taken or are planned there is still a considerable way to go to make the euro area a more dynamic economy which is crucial to meeting the challenges of globalisation population ageing and rapid technological change
2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9903445839881897;reform measures should foster more integrated flexible and competitive economies in the euro area thus allowing more efficient adjustment processes and a stronger resilience to shocks
2006-12-07;2006;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9828395247459412;these are essential conditions for the substantial benefits of the single currency to be better exploited and for the economic performance to improve in both the euro area as a whole and in each member state
