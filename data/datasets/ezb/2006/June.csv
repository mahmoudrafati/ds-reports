2006-06-08;2006;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9576860666275024;let me now report on the outcome of todays meeting which was also attended by the president of the eurogroup prime minister juncker and commissioner almunia
2006-06-08;2006;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9895167946815491;at todays meeting we decided to increase the key ecb interest rates by 25 basis points
2006-06-08;2006;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.960662305355072;this decision reflects the upside risks to price stability over the medium term that have been identified through both our economic and monetary analyses
2006-06-08;2006;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9824659824371338;the further withdrawal of monetary accommodation will thus contribute to ensuring that longerterm inflation expectations in the euro area remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability
2006-06-08;2006;June;REPORT;Positive;0.5697585940361023;as stressed on previous occasions such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting economic growth and job creation in the euro area
2006-06-08;2006;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9821877479553223;overall also after todays increase the key ecb interest rates are still low by historical standards liquidity is ample and our monetary policy remains accommodative
2006-06-08;2006;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9720692038536072;given the outlook for price developments and the dynamism of money and credit growth in the euro area we will continue to monitor closely all developments to ensure price stability over the medium and longer term
2006-06-08;2006;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9419136047363281;allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail starting with the economic analysis
2006-06-08;2006;June;REPORT;Positive;0.980881929397583;all the main indicators of economic activity that have recently become available are positive
2006-06-08;2006;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9874333739280701;according to eurostats first estimate on a quarteronquarter basis real gdp grew by 06 in the euro area in the first quarter of 2006 compared with 03 in the previous quarter with domestic demand making a significant contribution
2006-06-08;2006;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9895514845848083;the expected reacceleration of real gdp growth in the first months of 2006 has thus materialised confirming our view that economic growth is broadening and becoming more sustained
2006-06-08;2006;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9863770604133606;this assessment is further supported by information on activity in the second quarter  such as various confidence surveys and indicatorbased estimates  which continues to be encouraging
2006-06-08;2006;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.8348972201347351;looking further ahead the conditions are in place for growth in the euro area to remain close to its trend potential rate despite the impact of the rise in oil prices
2006-06-08;2006;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9889556765556335;growth in the economies of the euro areas main trading partners remains robust providing support for euro area exports

2006-06-08;2006;June;REPORT;Positive;0.992452085018158;consumption growth should continue to strengthen gradually over time in line with developments in real disposable income as the labour market situation gradually improves
2006-06-08;2006;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9535713195800781;this outlook is also reflected in the june eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections which provide additional input into our analysis of the prospects for economic activity
2006-06-08;2006;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9705156087875366;the projections foresee average annual real gdp growth in a range between 18 and 24 in 2006 and between 13 and 23 in 2007 the growth projections for 2006 are broadly unchanged from the ecb staff projections of march 2006 while those for 2007 are slightly lower reflecting mainly the recent rise in oil prices
2006-06-08;2006;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9860461354255676;most recent forecasts by international organisations and private sector institutions give a broadly similar picture
2006-06-08;2006;June;REPORT;Negative;0.7814010977745056;it is the governing councils view that risks to these projections for economic growth are broadly balanced over the shorter term while longerterm downside risks relate mainly to potential further oil price rises global imbalances and protectionism
2006-06-08;2006;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9833805561065674;turning to price developments according to eurostats flash estimate annual hicp inflation increased to 25 in may compared with 24 in april and 22 in march
2006-06-08;2006;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.6401188969612122;although no detailed information is available as yet this increase probably stems from energy price developments
2006-06-08;2006;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.954406201839447;in the months to come and in 2007 inflation rates are likely to remain above 2 the precise levels depending on future energy price developments
2006-06-08;2006;June;REPORT;Positive;0.5874453783035278;while the moderate evolution of labour costs in the euro area is expected to continue in 2007  also reflecting ongoing global competitive pressures particularly in the manufacturing sector  indirect effects of past oil price increases and the announced changes in indirect taxes are expected to have a significant upward effect on inflation
2006-06-08;2006;June;REPORT;Positive;0.5489565134048462;against this background it is crucial that the social partners continue to meet their responsibilities
2006-06-08;2006;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9879328608512878;further input into our assessment of the outlook for price developments is provided by the june eurosystem staff projections
2006-06-08;2006;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.758103609085083;annual hicp inflation is projected to lie between 21 and 25 in 2006 and between 16 and 28 in 2007 compared with the march 2006 ecb staff projections these ranges imply a slight upward shift to the profile for hicp inflation in 2006 largely reflecting the assumption of higher oil prices
2006-06-08;2006;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9894914627075195;in the view of the governing council risks to the outlook for price developments remain on the upside and include further increases in oil prices a stronger passthrough of past oil price rises into consumer prices than currently anticipated additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes and  more fundamentally  stronger than expected wage developments due to secondround effects of past oil price increases
2006-06-08;2006;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9349266886711121;turning to the monetary analysis the governing council again had a thorough discussion of underlying developments in money and credit
2006-06-08;2006;June;REPORT;Positive;0.991470992565155;in a context of already ample liquidity and very strong monetary and credit growth the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector has increased further in recent months to reach doubledigit levels
2006-06-08;2006;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9828044176101685;credit growth has also been broadly based across sectors
2006-06-08;2006;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9881654977798462;borrowing by households  especially for house purchase  and by nonfinancial corporations has been growing very strongly
2006-06-08;2006;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9139450192451477;at the same time monetary growth has risen further over the past few months with the annual growth rate of m3 standing at 88 in april
2006-06-08;2006;June;REPORT;Positive;0.8638353943824768;the rapid rate of monetary growth continues to be driven mainly by the expansion of its most liquid components
2006-06-08;2006;June;REPORT;Positive;0.6216839551925659;thus the latest developments confirm that the stimulative impact of the low level of interest rates remains the dominant factor behind the current high trend rate of monetary expansion which signals inflationary risks over the medium to longer term
2006-06-08;2006;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9390262365341187;the further acceleration of monetary and credit growth in this environment of already ample liquidity points to increased upside risks to price stability at longer horizons
2006-06-08;2006;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.7474193572998047;monetary developments therefore require careful monitoring in particular in the light of strong dynamics in housing markets
2006-06-08;2006;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9835577607154846;to sum up annual inflation rates are projected to remain elevated in 2006 and 2007 with risks to this outlook on the upside
2006-06-08;2006;June;REPORT;Positive;0.8346651196479797;given the strength of monetary and credit growth and the ample liquidity situation a crosscheck of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms that upside risks to price stability over the medium term prevail
2006-06-08;2006;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9852088689804077;a further adjustment of interest rates was therefore warranted
2006-06-08;2006;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9767969250679016;by acting in a timely fashion the governing council is helping to keep medium and longterm inflation expectations in line with price stability thereby making an ongoing contribution to sustainable economic growth and job creation
2006-06-08;2006;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9855493903160095;overall our monetary policy remains accommodative and the governing council will continue to monitor closely all developments to ensure that risks to price stability do not materialise
2006-06-08;2006;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9642452597618103;with regard to fiscal policies the forecasts published recently by the commission point to a broadly unchanged situation in the euro area in 2006 and 2007 deficit ratios are expected to remain at around the 2005 level of 24 while debt ratios after declining only marginally are forecast at levels still above 70 of gdp
2006-06-08;2006;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9935414791107178;this is disappointing against the background of the economic outlook
2006-06-08;2006;June;REPORT;Negative;0.5941495299339294;most countries with an excessive deficit have not corrected their position in a timely manner
2006-06-08;2006;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9808247685432434;furthermore there is a risk of consolidation delays in other countries
2006-06-08;2006;June;REPORT;Negative;0.8443374037742615;it is crucial to avoid the mistakes of the past when many countries failed to consolidate sufficiently in good times
2006-06-08;2006;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9716373682022095;the governing council considers that more determined progress is required towards sound public finances in a number of countries that concrete and credible measures should be implemented swiftly as part of a mediumtermoriented strategy and that it is vital to consolidate confidence in the revised stability and growth pact by ensuring the sustainability of public finances in the euro area
2006-06-08;2006;June;REPORT;Positive;0.7977067828178406;in terms of structural reforms the governing council reiterates its call for the implementation of firm measures to ensure open competitive and wellfunctioning product and labour markets so as to foster an attractive environment for investment and innovation and to promote flexibility in wages and prices
2006-06-08;2006;June;REPORT;Positive;0.984566867351532;there is a broad and firm consensus that such reforms are beneficial in promoting growth and employment and in enhancing the resilience of the euro area economy to external shocks
2006-06-08;2006;June;REPORT;Negative;0.98463374376297;at the same time these reforms would further facilitate intraeuro area adjustments by reducing rigidities that contribute in some economies to wage developments that lead to high and persistent unit labour cost growth higher inflationary pressure and losses in competitiveness
2006-06-08;2006;June;REPORT;Negative;0.8698931932449341;examples of such rigidities are low productivity growth due to a lack of competition in some sectors and an explicit or de facto indexation of nominal wages to prices
2006-06-08;2006;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9110799431800842;all in all a comprehensive set of reforms is essential to strengthen the foundations for sustained growth in output and employment across the euro area to underpin the ongoing economic recovery and to further smoothen the functioning of adjustment mechanisms in the euro area thereby facilitating the conduct of the single monetary policy
