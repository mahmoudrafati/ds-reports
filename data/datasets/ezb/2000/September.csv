2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9663932919502258;this moderation has mainly been a consequence of lower growth in the most liquid components of m3 which bear little or no remuneration indicating that the monetary policy measures taken since november 1999 are gradually feeding their way through

2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Positive;0.8567309379577637;in fact recent indicators suggest that following the period of acceleration the economic expansion may now have settled at a high rate of growth

2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9813840389251709;expectations of a period of sustained economic growth in the euro area can also be found in euro area bond markets
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9795714616775513;overall longerterm bond yields in the euro area have shown a very high level of stability in the course of this year with fluctuations being contained within a relatively narrow range

2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.7829176783561707;while monetary policy cannot address shortterm developments in prices it is imperative for monetary policy that mediumterm upward pressure on prices be contained
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9760355949401855;the risk that the current pressure on the hicp might spill over onto costs and prices determined in the domestic economy must be taken seriously
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Negative;0.6111788749694824;this holds true in particular in the context of the favourable prospects for economic growth
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9587259888648987;the governing council reacted to this picture by raising the main ecb interest rates at its meeting on 31 august 2000 this step followed a series of interest rate increases implemented since november 1999 the governing council will continue to remain alert to emerging risks to price stability
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9897986650466919;it is a matter of fact that recent oil price increases have caused the terms of trade of the euro area to deteriorate and thus have also reduced real income
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9354156255722046;this loss of real income cannot be avoided for the economy as a whole
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9755995869636536;attempts to shift the burden of this loss within the economy will risk endangering the continuation of a noninflationary growth process

2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9895570874214172;any attempt for wages to catch up in reaction to recent oil price increases would be highly detrimental to the current favourable growth prospects since monetary policy would need to react to the resulting upward pressure on prices
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Negative;0.8780794143676758;governments also have to play a role in order not to convey the false impression that the costs stemming from the increase in oil prices could be avoided by relaxing budgetary policies
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Positive;0.5316766500473022;this would not be in line with the needs of establishing budget positions in balance or in surplus and would complicate the fostering of tax reforms conducive to a stronger growth potential of the euro area
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Positive;0.9616392254829407;i should also like to reiterate that the prospects for a stronger potential for growth in the euro area will depend very much on progress made in enhancing the flexibility of labour and goods markets in the euro area
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9674739837646484;although reform efforts in several countries have been heading in the right direction there is still much to be done when looking at the area as a whole
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.863007128238678;finally let me also say a few words about recent exchange rate developments
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Negative;0.993970513343811;i noted earlier that from a monetary policy point of view these developments are a cause for concern as they add to the upward pressure on consumer prices in the euro area
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9920623302459717;these concerns are compounded by the fact that the exchange rate of the euro does not appear appropriate when looking at economic fundamentals
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9775953888893127;as you are aware we have been expressing this concern for some time
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Positive;0.99183589220047;in the meantime we have witnessed a considerable improvement in the economic growth prospects for the euro area
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Positive;0.9846276640892029;at the same time owing to measures taken by the governing council the outlook for price stability in the medium term in the euro area has remained intact
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9680076241493225;at present inflation in the euro area is among the lowest in the world
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Negative;0.8996867537498474;the fact that the euro has continued to depreciate over recent months is not in line with these strong economic fundamentals in the euro area
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.98466956615448;recent global exchange rate developments are also not in line with international balance of payments positions
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9563621282577515;our concerns on this issue remain serious and we shall monitor developments closely
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8538966178894043;let me now give the floor to the vicepresident to say a few words about other issues discussed by the governing council
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9810726642608643;first i should like to inform you that the governing council has agreed on a target reimbursement scheme for the benefit of target participants in the event of malfunctioning in target
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9868833422660828;the scheme will apply whenever the sameday processing of payment orders within target cannot be completed
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9762836694717407;the reimbursement scheme is intended to compensate participants for certain higher costs they incur in having recourse to the standing facilities of the eurosystem as a result of a malfunctioning
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9880391955375671;in order to ensure a level playingfield the scheme also applies to participants in euro realtime gross settlement rtgs systems of nonparticipating national central banks
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9847538471221924;the legal framework for this reimbursement scheme is reflected in an amended target guideline which in line with the ecbs policy of enhanced transparency will be published in the official journal of the european communities and made available on the ecbs website shortly
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9812065958976746;second the governing council addressed issues relating to crossborder retail payment services which are of particular interest for euro area consumers
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8647370338439941;you may recall that the ecb published a report on this subject a year ago calling on the banking industry to improve the unsatisfactory service level for crossborder credit transfers before january 2002 today on the basis of a progress report we have reviewed the advances of the banking industry against the objectives set by the eurosystem and we have identified the outstanding issues that need quickly to be addressed
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9350395202636719;a press release on this topic will be issued later on today
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9422876238822937;the progress report will be available on the ecbs website shortly
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9318070411682129;we are now at your disposal should you have any questions
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.887698233127594;transcript of the questions asked and the answers given by dr willem f duisenberg president of the ecb and christian noyer vicepresident of the ecb question translation two questions for president duisenberg
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.6379375457763672;the first question concerns your absence which has been sharply criticised by the ministers of finance at the versailles meeting
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9175587892532349;i would like to know why you did not feel it necessary to cancel your visit to canada and why on tuesday before the european parliament you said to the monetary affairs committee of the european parliament that you had been told of the date of the informal meeting only two months ago
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9805856347084045;now according to the french presidency the information concerning that date was given to you at the end of last year
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.984745979309082;this is usually the case because the whole schedule for the presidency is known six months before the presidency starts
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9743523001670837;this means that you should have known about this date eight months ago
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9449379444122314;so why did you say this to the european parliament
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.6572362780570984;then the second question concerning budgets
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9251434803009033;you are asking governments as i understand it not to relax fiscal discipline and i would like therefore to know what you think about the tax cuts which the french government has decided to make and which tend to promote demand rather than supply
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.38492482900619507;thank you
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.42331743240356445;duisenberg thank you
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.7467280030250549;i was not aware that the presidency had already informed me of this late last year as you say
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8890641331672668;my recollection is that i learned in july about the forthcoming ecofin meeting
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9802824258804321;i had a meeting which was already agreed a year ago in canada for a fullday discussion where i was to be the only speaker with around 150 representatives from the banking community the former ministers of finance and ambassadors from both the united states and canada
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.6868379712104797;that meeting had been widely publicised and it is true to say that my name appearing on the invitation as the discussant had indeed attracted quite a number of may i say important representatives from the financial and political community in north america
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8601458668708801;and i felt that i could not breach that commitment of which i informed the presidency immediately after i became aware of the forthcoming ecofin meeting
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9493296146392822;now it would have been i believe the 50th ecofin meeting i had attended
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9389691948890686;it is the first time that the absence of a central bank governor or of a minister from such a meeting caused more than a ripple in the water
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.5896334648132324;but apparently that happened
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.929033100605011;as far as the tax cuts by the french government are concerned i should like to refer to the statement i just made in which i said that the increase in oil prices does whether we like it or not place a burden  it has a terms of trade effect in technical jargon  on the economy as a whole
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9551143646240234;attempts to shift that burden inside the economy from one side to the other do not change anything
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9050559401512146;in technical jargon it is a negative terms of trade effect
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9798178672790527;and so my judgement on specific measures in specific countries must always be seen in the light of that statement that general statement
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9765329957008362;and i am not in the habit of commenting on measures taken in individual countries of the euro area
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9480918049812317;but the message from my statement ought to be clear
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8799844980239868;question my question is about the announcement on the foreign exchange markets which the ecb made this morning
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.7133362293243408;obviously anything that the ecb does concerning foreign exchange markets at this time is going to attract a lot of attention
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9800002574920654;and i think that the basic consensus of opinion out there is that what the ecb did was something like an intervention but with another name
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.7378184199333191;my question to you is was there any motivation whatsoever to do this today to boost the euro
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.943120002746582;duisenbergthe decision to sell the accumulated interest receipts over the past year and a half was already taken  as we have indicated in our statement  a few weeks ago
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9650570750236511;the decision on when to do so depended very much on market conditions and on technical and tactical considerations
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Negative;0.6364316940307617;now whether you call this intervention or not intervening in the market was not the motive which led to this decision
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Negative;0.8158064484596252;but i cannot deny that the price that we will make today is in our view not unattractive
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9479042887687683;and therefore the decision was explained very clearly i think
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9742407202720642;the sum of around eur 25 billion will be sold in a relatively short time
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9802903532981873;and this exercise will be repeated rather more frequently in the future before any such large accumulation piles up
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9866948127746582;so we will repeat this exercise as by the way most central banks do all the time
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9856692552566528;we will repeat it at regular intervals which leaves us some leeway  also again for tactical market considerations  to determine the precise moment
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9463116526603699;question would you say that you are entirely disappointed by the market reaction
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9566545486450195;duisenberg i was not disappointed by the market reaction
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Negative;0.8979285955429077;question but if i said that this is a purely technical move which the market basically misinterpreted anybody out there who thinks that this was in any way meant to help the euro would be making a completely false interpretation
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Negative;0.8767066597938538;duisenberg i can say that it was not meantto damage the euro
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Positive;0.5482438802719116;question translation over the past few years there has been a great deal of talk about market sentiment
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.5637596845626831;in your view how great is the level of market sentiment at the moment and how significant is the psychological factor
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.6457284092903137;duisenberg now i am not in a position to quantify a psychological factor
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.777638852596283;i am not a psychiatrist
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Positive;0.445952445268631;it is of course true that these factors namely the  to my mind unduly great  attention that the exchange rate attracts in the market in the media and among the public do play a role
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Positive;0.9888215065002441;people are more or less ignoring as i said in my statement the underlying strong fundamentals of the euro area economy
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8803385496139526;however we are convinced that there will come a moment when these underlying fundamental factors will prevail in the markets judgement about what the exchange rate should be
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Negative;0.6435912251472473;i cannot forecast when that will happen but i am psychologically convinced that it will happen
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.7265231013298035;question mr duisenberg in the recent opinion polls in denmark there was a clear majority in favour of a no vote in the referendum and the reason why there has been a fairly substantial increase in no votes in the opinion polls lies in the fall of the euro rates
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Negative;0.987105131149292;last night the governor of the central bank nyboe andersen said that there is an image problem in relation to the euro which among other things is due to the fall in the euro rates
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.7858303785324097;what are your comments on that
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8673501014709473;could you do something to change this development
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Positive;0.9536721706390381;duisenberg well if there is the perception in denmark that there is an image problem for the euro and that this could have an impact on danish opinion and on the ultimate outcome of the referendum i would be happy to try to convince the danish people that the outlook for the euro area is a very positive one
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Positive;0.908157467842102;the outlook for income and output and thus welfare developments is very positive indeed and i would hope that if i had the opportunity to do so i would be able to convince the danish public that for that reason alone it would be worth joining
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9696078896522522;question translation mr duisenberg when you say that oil price rises mean that money is flowing into the oil exporting countries and you tell governments here not to do anything about this does this mean that greater emphasis should be placed upon the first pillar of your monetary policy strategy and that you should therefore focus more on monetary aggregates
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Negative;0.5950525403022766;duisenberg i have been misinterpreted if you have interpreted me in that way
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9900400042533875;the simple statement is that the oil price increase has a socalled terms of trade effect
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9670522809028625;it means a loss in real income for the economy as a whole
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.6913472414016724;now i was not directing myself to governments only when i said that any attempts to shift the burden of this loss in income from one sector to the other would be futile they would not prevent the loss from being incurred
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.527561604976654;so whether governments or employers employees or social partners are concerned we should all be very much aware that we cannot prevent this loss in income from actually materialising
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Positive;0.9712532162666321;any attempts to try to shift the burden of the loss from one sector to another should also be judged in the light of the necessary and clearly desirable continuation of strong noninflationary growth in the euro area and in all the individual countries
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9776204228401184;it is against this yardstick that both you and i should judge those attempts be they by governments or social partners or by particular interest groups be they by truckers by pilots or whomever
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9214109182357788;question i wonder does your announcement that you are going to sell the interest income on your foreign currency in any way mean that you are not likely to sell any more of your foreign currency
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8470211625099182;and a related question is there any implication for the currency reserves of the national central banks which are much higher
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.5655466914176941;everybody is wondering much more about what is going to happen to these ie
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.833807110786438;whether the national central banks are also likely to cash in at the very attractive price which you mentioned
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.7669884562492371;is there any coordination on this matter in the council
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8646854758262634;duisenberglast question first of course there is coordination
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9292272925376892;second question in the middle you have to be aware that many central banks  may i say in this particular case including the deutsche bundesbank  are in the habit of regularly selling and have already sold their net accruals of foreign reserves stemming from their investments in us dollars or yen
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9571191072463989;this is common practice almost daily practice
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9481493234634399;it is the first time for the ecb but it is certainly not the first time for a central bank
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Negative;0.495339035987854;in effect i have had many questions from you touching upon rumours in the market to the effect that there have been interventions
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8116576075553894;is it true or not
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8521814346313477;i have always said no
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9890974760055542;however commercial transactions have of course been conducted by central banks on a continuous basis and they are among those transactions conducted in the past
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.926633894443512;now the first question the most important one does this decision signal that you are not going to sell any more or any less in the future
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.977410614490509;this decision has to be judged entirely in its own right and it says nothing about any future sales or purchases of foreign currency
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.962817370891571;as i have always said because it is the main thrust of your question when there are interventions in the market i will tell you not ex ante but ex post
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8841201663017273;question mr duisenberg do you consider inflation to have peaked in july and if so can you explain the reasons for this in more detail
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9806720614433289;duisenberg the inflation figure for july 24 was clearly influenced by developments in oil prices and import prices in general including the depreciation of the euro exchange rate
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.6054788827896118;our expectation  based on an analysis of what we are seeing around us  is that it may indeed have proven to be the peak but we can never be sure
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8245999813079834;however next monday you will have another price index figure and our expectation is that you may indeed have seen the peak
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8039284944534302;question are you disappointed that there is no common position among the member countries of the euro area on lowering the taxes on oil products
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9376901388168335;yesterday the decision by the french government to lower some taxes on oil products was criticised by government representatives in the german parliament
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9454163908958435;two weeks ago mr eichel said that the italian government had made a mistake in lowering taxes on oil products
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.6356581449508667;is that not a rather callous position on these issues
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9524279236793518;duisenberg well as i said i am not in the habit of commenting on developments either in the tax field or in other fields of economic policy in individual countries
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9885623455047607;let me say this if these tax measures had become a euro areawide trend then i would have been disappointed
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9150955677032471;question could you comment on your assessment of the monetary conditions in the euro area following your 31 august decision to raise interest rates
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.7939808964729309;and describe for us perhaps whether you feel that they are still accommodative
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9655035734176636;and could you describe for us your policy stance for instance
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Negative;0.7979097366333008;is it still biased towards tightening
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8824322819709778;duisenberg i believe i have already made those comments in my introductory statement and i have nothing to add to it
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Positive;0.5760853290557861;question you keep describing the european economy as strong and express satisfaction with growth stabilising at above 3
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Negative;0.5287842154502869;but in the united states growth is stabilising at above 4
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8460332155227661;so i would like to ask you two questions related to that
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Negative;0.857456624507904;first of all is this not really the fundamental explanation of the socalled mystery of the weakness of the euro
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9373326301574707;and secondly why are you so sure that 3 is actually as good as can be achieved by the euro area even under the present structural conditions
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.7047061324119568;a few years ago in the united states the fed used to believe as you do that the sustainable growth rate was below 3
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.797342836856842;but they were not sure
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8646998405456543;so alan greenspan launched what he himself admitted was a growth experiment
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Negative;0.5403430461883545;he kept monetary policy loose and accommodative until he could see clear evidence of inflation actually accelerating
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.7520962953567505;why do you not perform a similar growth experiment in europe
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9596446752548218;duisenberg that answers the question i just dodged by referring to my introductory statement and it answers this
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Negative;0.5960099697113037;we are of the opinion that liquidity conditions as i have said are still ample
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.923892617225647;and that is not by way of an experiment
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Negative;0.7841225862503052;now i take issue with the statement that the us economy seems to be stabilising at a rate of 4
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.5636109113693237;we do not know that
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8194000720977783;and mr greenspan does not know that either
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Positive;0.8897597789764404;we do think that in the course of the coming two years the growth performance of the euro area will not stay below and may even go beyond the growth performance of the united states remarkably and admirably high as it is
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8563255667686462;but we think that we will be able to match that performance in europe in the coming years
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8140894174575806;and that is one of the main reasons which in my mind underpins our assessment that the strengthening of the euro will come
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9082480669021606;for i happen to agree with you that the growth differential which we have observed over the past number of years is one of the main explanatory items or causes for the depreciation of the euro visàvis the us dollar
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8599725961685181;as to whether it is the full explanation as you seem to be implying there i have my doubts
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.7205667495727539;question i have two questions
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Negative;0.8333644270896912;i would be very grateful if you could answer them plainly just to get away from the economic jargon which quite frankly is confusing me a little bit today
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.93650221824646;they are both about oil prices
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8602113127708435;the first question
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9800254106521606;you have talked about reduced real income and a loss of real income
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9304550886154175;does that mean that in your opinion the high oil prices are going to be felt in the economy of the euro area in the form of a slowdown of some sort
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Negative;0.5994581580162048;the second question is along the same lines i am just trying to find a language which is a bit more comprehensible to me today are you saying that you are opposed to governments buckling under popular pressure to lower oil tax and fuel taxes
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9132289886474609;duisenberg if oil prices were to remain at the high levels where they have landed so to speak then it would have the effect of as i said a loss of income a loss of real growth
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.97423255443573;but that has to be compared against the growth that would otherwise have to take place
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8966973423957825;so we do not yet know precisely
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9453555941581726;there are already estimates around from various institutions and organisations of what the real impact of the persistently high level of oil prices will be
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9711513519287109;those estimates vary from 0 to 1 percentage point
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9506267309188843;we have not yet reached the stage i must confess where we feel in a position to be able to quantify precisely what this is
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9142427444458008;and if we had reached that stage i am not sure whether i would tell you
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Negative;0.8796722292900085;but that it has a negative impact on the growth figure as such if the prices were to stay there that is undeniable
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9145739078521729;that is certain
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8359583616256714;the second question was on the tax measures again
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.97934889793396;no i am not going to go into the precise measures that governments should take in whatever tax field or expenditure field
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Positive;0.863873302936554;i am just urging governments to stick to the goals of  over the medium term  getting their houses in order bringing their budget into balance or with a small surplus and continuing the efforts of  also through tax measures  making markets more flexible and changing the structure of the tax system so that it helps to fight unemployment
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9700488448143005;all measures should always be seen in that light
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9612447619438171;question mr duisenberg it is more than half a century since montgomery started liberating the netherlands
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9005435109138489;he said no guts no glory when starting operation market garden
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Negative;0.6203916072845459;do you feel that if the markets hold this view it will take a long time to intervene in the market
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.7418551445007324;if they think you have no guts do you not think that this will pose a real threat to price stability given the magnitude of the task conferred upon you by the maastricht treaty of keeping inflation at a level of 2
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.863778293132782;thus are interventions at this time not really necessary
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9502376914024353;duisenberg well i can assure you that i have given you my opinion about interventions and i will tell you about them once they have occurred but not before that
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9353281259536743;however i can assure you that neither i nor my colleagues have any need for guts
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Negative;0.5034633874893188;that at least is our gut feeling
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9658952355384827;question translation president duisenberg how much money how many hundreds of millions of euro and us dollars are transacted on the currency markets every day
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9279906749725342;have you any idea of that
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Negative;0.7938717007637024;that leads me to my next question you said that there is something by which one ought to explain the weakness of the euro i mean there has been growth in europe  even the americans have noticed that  interest rates have gone up the differential has come down so what is the problem with the euro
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Negative;0.48919805884361267;is it that the anglosaxon financial markets are really against this new currency and are speculating against it because they are saying that political integration is not good enough and that there is going to be further enlargement
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8998314142227173;and if you do not want to say what you think about this then clearly there is something wrong because there are some things you have been saying that you cannot explain and you have been saying so for the past year so what is going on
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9284577369689941;duisenberg the daily turnover in the foreign exchange market christian is it a trillion
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8988093137741089;noyer something of the sort but i do not think it has any relevance to the issues we discussed today
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9829800128936768;with a view to the size of the market there are a number of transactions that are nationally balanced so making a comparison between any such decision by one actor to do one thing and the global amount of the market does not make any sense
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.915056049823761;i do not think you can infer any conclusion from that
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8386399745941162;the majority of operations are by nature balanced so i do not think that this can lead you to a proper conclusion
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9071590900421143;duisenberg second part of your question then
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9699621200561523;when i answered anatole kaletsky and said that i agreed with him that the growth differential between the two major economic areas in the world was a large part of the explanation for the exchange rate developments i said a large part ie
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8744605183601379;there is more which i cannot fully explain
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.6407303214073181;and there are many factors like the ones you quoted which also have an impact
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.974903404712677;with the benefit of hindsight we can sometimes identify those factors
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9899905920028687;however then there is also the phenomenon that markets have a tendency to overshoot in one direction or another
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Negative;0.8949273824691772;it is a temporary phenomenon
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.75789475440979;it does not mean that markets are not right
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Negative;0.9732168912887573;markets are of course always right but overshooting means that at some point there will be a reversal
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9532629251480103;and it is that point which i am so anxiously awaiting
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8870760202407837;question i have a question for vicepresident noyer first and then a short one for president duisenberg

2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9532065987586975;in other words were the finance ministers part of this decision or was it a purely internal ecb decision
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.6134964227676392;and for president duisenberg what was your reaction last week when you heard chancellor schröders assessment of the euro being good for german exports particularly east german exports

2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8765501976013184;question we talked earlier about the forthcoming danish referendum on the euro and i wanted to ask you what you thought would be the impact on the euro and the prospects for new countries joining the euro if the danes were to vote no in their referendum
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.7699974775314331;duisenbergagain i cannot judge the psychological impact

2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9809561371803284;denmark would with such a decision give up all the potential benefits of membership of monetary union
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.924855649471283;question translation president duisenberg how do you assess suggestions from the german banking industry such as for instance the suggestion that the european central bank should not intervene but should announce very clearly that it intends to sell large quantities of currency reserves and obtain benefits for the national treasuries and therefore continue with debt reduction
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.7202490568161011;duisenberg the reserves of both the ecb and the ncbs are entirely and exclusively in the hands of the national central banks themselves and i am inclined to ignore advice such as that which seems to be coming from the german banking community
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8999921083450317;question mr duisenberg you said that secondround effects must be avoided
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9391236305236816;and in brussels you said that the actual level i quote of the stock of m3 is much higher than the level implied by the reference value
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9406806230545044;does this mean that liquidity to accommodate secondround effects is already in the market and that all the ecb can do is try moral persuasion
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8884294033050537;that was the first question
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Negative;0.49564364552497864;second question mr noyer you said that the finance ministers were not informed
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.4956323206424713;when you decided to sell the interests did the imminent pressure in favour of interventions on the political side play any role in your considerations
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9627658724784851;when you answer this question  and i see you are smiling  may i remind you that you promised to give honest answers
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9326723217964172;and the third question is can the ecb decide upon bilateral interventions by itself
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9388123154640198;i mean interventions make sense if they are made bilaterally  you said so yourself
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9409306049346924;are you entitled to do so if you want to
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9220128059387207;duisenberg the answer to the last question is yes
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9758926033973694;as long as there are no socalled general orientations being issued by the council of ministers which is possible according to the treaty albeit that the council of ministers said at the luxembourg summit three years ago that the issuance of such general orientations would only be considered in very exceptional circumstances
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9830160737037659;thus as long as such general orientations have not been issued the daytoday management of the foreign exchange market  and that includes whether or not to intervene  is in the hands of the governing council of the ecb
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.7799966335296631;i believe i cannot be clearer than that
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9046412706375122;now is the liquidity to accommodate possible secondround effects already there
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.447854608297348;i can only say that the growth of m3 over the past year and a half and the growth in credit to the private sector month after month after month over the past year and a half were both far in excess of what we call our reference value and both point to the fact that liquidity conditions at present can be characterised as still being ample
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9593303203582764;what they are being used for is a different matter which we do not decide upon
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8481696248054504;but they are ample
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.7471275925636292;as for your third question as to whether the sale of our interest income from foreign exchange has something to do with pressure from financial circles or finance ministers to start interventions i should like to point out that i cannot imagine that you can conclude that the fact that these pressures were there is something of the last few days or maybe the last week
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9690971970558167;the decision to divest these accrued interest receipts was already taken on 31 august  question  yes but you are forwardlooking in your policy  duisenberg  yes but i can assure you that in preparing decisions we are also forwardlooking
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9422906637191772;so preparing a decision on 31 august took place a long time before 31 august
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.5220900774002075;question if i could just return briefly to the question of oil prices
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8030709624290466;what you said was that oil price increases mean a loss of income for the economy as a whole and that it is inappropriate for governments to try to shift that loss from one sector to another
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.8468082547187805;the reason that the protests about this have taken  duisenberg sorry i did not say it was inappropriate but i said that if an economic agent be it a government employers or employees wants to try to shift that burden this must always be assessed in the light of the fact that for the domestic economy the economic loss will be there wherever the loss is being borne
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9807310104370117;and any measures taken by whomsoever be it governments or other economic agents must be assessed against the background of longterm structural policy aims which will be there which are there oil price increases or not
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9720883369445801;question given that the protests are being staged by some groups which are being affected more than other groups in society fishermen hauliers and farmers are you saying that in your revised version or at least in the clarification of your answer that you can in fact understand why governments would wish to respond to what appears to be an injustice to these people facing a greater burden and that in effect it could be appropriate for governments to take action to shift this burden
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Positive;0.7253913283348083;duisenberg i have a great understanding for governments
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.5021383762359619;i can always fully understand  but that has nothing to do with my job as a central banker  that governments may be inclined to alleviate the burden for some and make it even heavier for others or to find room in their budgets by cutting expenditure in order to take countermeasures on account of the weakest categories in society
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.7331600785255432;i have full understanding for that but as i say it has to be assessed against the background of the fact that the loss to the economy as a whole cannot be avoided and one cannot get around this fact
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9904306530952454;the specific measures which whatever pressure group or government or economic agent in general is contemplating has to be assessed against the longterm goals of the official policy
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9886652231216431;it has to be evaluated against the background of the structure of the fiscal system and of deficits
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.969698965549469;and then you can come to a conclusion as to whether the specific action taken is appropriate or not
2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.9758029580116272;that i leave to the principle of subsidiarity that is to say i leave it up to the national authorities to come to their own conclusions and maybe even to make these public

2000-09-14;2000;September;REPORT;Neutral;0.893649160861969;the question is how do i see the chances of there being a renewal or modification of the plaza or louvre agreements of the past
