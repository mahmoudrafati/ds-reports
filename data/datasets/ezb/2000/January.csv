2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Positive;0.985666811466217;this positive outcome reflects the careful preparation of the banking and financial community as well as the comprehensive and flexible operational framework of the eurosystem

2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Negative;0.5895015597343445;after the successful transition to the year 2000 there is no longer any need to extend the current situation of abundant liquidity

2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9817860722541809;the threemonth average of the annual growth rates of m3 covering the period from september to november 1999 was 60 that is to say slightly higher than the figure of 59 recorded for the threemonth period from august to october 1999 accordingly it remained around 1½ percentage points above the reference value of 4½
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Positive;0.8951983451843262;overall current liquidity conditions in the euro area continue to be generous
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9884013533592224;this is also confirmed by the continued strong growth of loans to the private sector 101 in november compared with 99 in october 1999
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9521804451942444;moving to the euro area financial markets as we have already noted it is clear that they were able to weather the century date change without encountering any major problems
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9834739565849304;the associated risk premium in shortterm interest rates had already declined in the last week of december 1999 and had completely disappeared by the time the markets opened on 3 january 2000 longterm government bond yields have climbed by around 30 basis points since endnovember partly in tandem with bond yields in the united states but also in response to a more optimistic outlook for the euro area economy
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9658330678939819;at todays meeting the governing council also focused on the economic outlook
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.5354166030883789;in particular note was taken of the fact that activity in the world economy is continuing to gain momentum as projections for world output growth have been revised upwards recently
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9918742775917053;this mainly reflects the sustained and high level of growth of the us economy but also the broad upturn in growth in other industrialised countries and the strong recovery in asian emerging market economies
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9892534613609314;the latest developments relating to economic activity in the euro area have contributed to the improved outlook for the global economy and are consistent with the expectation that growth differentials between the main economic regions will narrow
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Positive;0.986584484577179;a recent estimate for euro area real gdp growth in the third quarter of 1999 clearly confirmed the widely expected upturn in growth
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9921373724937439;survey data for the industrial sector point to continued solid output growth in the final quarter of last year
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9926519989967346;in addition private consumption growth should benefit further from continued employment growth and a high level of consumer confidence
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.8741794228553772;as regards consumer price developments the harmonised index of consumer prices hicp increased further in november 1999 to a large extent the upward movement in november reflects higher price increases for energy and unprocessed food which is similar to the situation observed in previous months
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.985956072807312;the annual rate of change in the overall hicp was 16 following an increase of 14 in october
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9825320243835449;when discussing the risks to price stability the governing council recognised that in the short term consumer price developments are expected to remain subject to further upward pressure
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9342399835586548;this is mainly due to higher oil prices but also to developments in the effective exchange rate of the euro and to a gradual unwinding of the earlier downward movements in food prices
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.8470662236213684;the combined effect of these factors is expected to lead to a peak in the overall hicp increase in early 2000 and to lessen thereafter
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Negative;0.8397018313407898;therefore taken by itself the upward movement in the rate of increase in the hicp expected for early 2000 should not give undue cause for concern
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.8779553771018982;however in terms of the outlook for price stability in the medium term it is essential that the immediate upward movement does not translate into general inflationary pressures and in particular that it does not trigger second round effects such as excessive wage claims
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Negative;0.6192649006843567;indeed stabilityoriented behaviour is urgently required
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9696622490882874;in conclusion the available indicators confirm our previous analysis and assessment on the overall situation as regards the risks to price stability
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9220614433288574;against this background we remain both confident and vigilant
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.940178394317627;let me now give the floor to the vicepresident to introduce some of the additional topics
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9780303239822388;i should like to draw your attention to two items not directly linked to todays meeting of the governing council
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9882572293281555;the first one deals with one aspect of the ecbs monetary policy competence
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9885496497154236;pursuant to the treaty article 106 2 the ecb has the exclusive right to approve the volume of coins issued by the euro area member states
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9845213294029236;to this end the governing council adopted in late december a decision on the volume of coin issuance in 2000 this decision will be published in the official journal of the european communities shortly
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9751908183097839;the second item relates to the executive boards decision to adjust the ecbs organisational structure according to the needs of a still growing institution on the one hand and to better accommodate the challenges ahead on the other
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9656380414962769;among the changes you will find an upgrading of the directorate statistics to a directorate general in order to enhance its role as provider of monetary and financial statistics to the general public as well as a restructuring of the directorate general economics
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9574323892593384;an updated organisational chart is available in the room this afternoon
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9318070411682129;we are now at your disposal should you have any questions
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Negative;0.7370362877845764;transcript of the questions asked and the answers given by dr willem f duisenberg president of the ecb and christian noyer vicepresident of the ecb question financial markets all over the world have been very volatile recently shooting up in december and correcting now
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.6333544254302979;do you think that might have anything to do with the extra liquidity that all the major central banks have been pumping into the market and with the withdrawal that is happening now
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9349308609962463;duisenberg i do not think that it has anything to do with liquidity operations both before and after the century date change
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9343928694725037;the phenomenon we are seeing  as you correctly phrase it a strong boom in a short period and a quick correction some time later  is by itself not at all abnormal
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9119641184806824;question your report seems to suggest that everything in your garden is rosy with the exception  perhaps  of the fact that the euro continues to slide along the floor round about parity with the dollar
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Positive;0.4638783037662506;throughout last year you were telling us that things were going to get better and that the potential of the euro would soon become manifest in a high exchange rate
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.7582796812057495;do you expect that that will happen that this confidence will become manifest during this year
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.968923807144165;duisenbergi did not mention a high exchange rate but  for the rest  i expect it to happen
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Negative;0.5986624360084534;yes and well so far so good i would like to say it has happened
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Negative;0.7945338487625122;question you mentioned that  when you were talking about consumer price inflation  that it is essential that it does not translate into upward pressure
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.5052886605262756;how serious do you think that risk is and how long do you think before it is apparent how big the risk is
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Negative;0.5385182499885559;duisenberg well i cannot quantify how serious the risk is
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Negative;0.7442989349365234;but what we are vigilant about is that the steady increase in the rate of inflation which we have witnessed over the past and which we are still witnessing does not translate itself into secondround effects in the form of higher wage demands and secondary price rounds
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9517927169799805;but then as i said for the coming months we do expect the effects of the higher energy prices of the higher prices of unprocessed food and of last years effective depreciation of the euro to work their way through slowly into the price level so that we  let me put it this way  we will not be surprised if inflation still creeps up a little bit in the coming months but we are also confident that it will then after a while taper off and level off to we hope a rate which we forecast for the year 2000 an average rate of inflation of 1½
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Positive;0.8831179738044739;question mr duisenberg the london financial community has just celebrated a year without the euro and they pronounce record incomes and everything
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.5337658524513245;are you afraid that the london financial community could pressure mr blair not to go any further in his movement towards the euro ie
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.5166530013084412;are you afraid that great britain could stay out of the euro for a long time to come
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.7755828499794006;duisenberg i am not afraid of it but i do not hope for it
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.807579755783081;question just again on the first year of the euro
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Negative;0.536422073841095;i wonder if after a year with the ecb at the helm of monetary policy you could give us your general feeling about how it has gone so far and if you can pinpoint any areas any challenges ahead for the coming year anything that you think the ecb should be working on to build credibility in the currency
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.8665409088134766;duisenberg about how it has gone so far i can only repeat myself
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9845288395881653;we were extremely pleased with the start of the euro with the transition to the euro the smooth changeover
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9871038794517517;we were extremely pleased with the quick adjustment of markets to the new environment the fact that a europewide money market emerged in a matter of days and that it has functioned very well ever since
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9747425317764282;we were extremely pleased that  with the exception of a few mishaps in the first few weeks  that our transeuropean payment system has functioned so well and so rapidly and that it had  after a few weeks  already become the largest in terms of daily turnover the largest payment system in the world which is functioning very smoothly
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Positive;0.749460756778717;i think we have reason to be satisfied that we have demonstrated that this new body the governing council of the european central bank could take decisions in time in an effective way and in anticipation of future developments
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Positive;0.899201512336731;so i must say i am pleased with the way  it sounds a little bit like bragging  with the way we actually conducted monetary policy and took major monetary policy decisions
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9078642725944519;we were to say the least not surprised that the exchange rate of the euro in the first few months of 1999 came down from the high level it started at
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.740882158279419;i was somewhat surprised although it is explicable that the exchange rate then went down further  lets say  through the level which had persisted throughout 1997 and 1998 and came close to socalled parity with the dollar
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Positive;0.9756356477737427;i am pleased that in recent weeks and especially in recent days the euro has moved away from that level again
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.6979472637176514;and then when i say we were somewhat surprised  with the benefit of hindsight of course one can explain everything  it is not really surprising that the very different cyclical situations prevailing in europe and the united states did cause the exchange rate to move in the direction it did
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Negative;0.8405912518501282;moreover now that we see that cyclical developments in the united states and europe are converging  that as i said in my introductory statement the differentials are likely to narrow if not to disappear altogether  we will not be surprised that our expectation which we have expressed time and again that the euro has a strong upward potential will become reality
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.82032310962677;and the question was for the future what is our task
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9609698057174683;i think our task is to remain vigilant to closely monitor economic developments and especially economic prospects and to take the monetary policy decisions in time and at an early stage if and when the need arises
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9128990173339844;but that is not today
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9454700350761414;question translation mr duisenberg you will be travelling to the g7 meeting in tokyo on 22 january
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9875105619430542;the japanese ministry of finance is already spreading the word that the exchange rates between the dollar the yen and the euro will specifically be discussed there
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9090980887413025;what principles will you establish at this conference in respect of exchange rate policy and your role in the global economy this year
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9761442542076111;duisenberg the japanese have not yet been in touch with me nor with others about what they want to discuss in tokyo on exchange rates
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9044803977012634;so i have not given them a reaction and i am not giving you a reaction either
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9742075800895691;i think that the attitude of the monetary authorities of europe and the united states will remain  that we will closely watch the exchange rate developments between the three major economic areas but that for us these developments do not give rise to a change in our attitude or policies
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Negative;0.8463728427886963;question translation mr president you have constantly warned against excessive wage settlements in view of the inflation risk
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.8654263615608215;could you give us a rough indication of the mark at which a wage settlement might be excessive
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.38492482900619507;thank you
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.788830041885376;the teething problems that you mentioned for target can you describe what the main problems have been even if they are teething problems exactly what form they have taken
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9508683085441589;duisenberg no it is different for the various areas and industries in the euro area
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9381915330886841;generally speaking we would hope that any wage settlement going in excess of the rate of productivity increase could be avoided
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Negative;0.8728811740875244;question before the switchover to the year 2000 it was said that uncertainty over the liquidity situation during the switchover somewhat limited the room for manoeuvre for monetary policy
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Negative;0.535714328289032;do you now feel that the switchover went smoothly do you now feel that monetary policy has gained room for manoeuvre again
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.7820737957954407;noyerwe have never said that
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9290252327919006;some of you maybe or other commentators have said so
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9907675385475159;but i think all central banks were concerned about the liquidity situation
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.8628913760185242;we have focussed on that and have avoided making big changes in the last days of the year so that is obvious
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9589431881904602;but all i have explained in our assessment is that we were concerned that sufficient liquidity would be available over the turn of theyear
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Negative;0.8640587329864502;we have ensured that this has been the case
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Positive;0.7503900527954102;this transition has gone smoothly
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.7506275773048401;now we have to return to a normal liquidity situation
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9204591512680054;that means not a tight liquidity situation
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9560791850090027;it means a more or less neutral liquidity situation
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9779157042503357;and this is how you have to interpret the fact that we have given a ceiling of 3 to interest rates in our finetuning operation to indicate that this was consistent with more or less neutrality that it is a normal liquidity situation in which the interest rates in the market can hover around the 3 benchmark that we are giving
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.843032717704773;question can i have a followup on that
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Negative;0.7390588521957397;are you disappointed about the relatively small interest in that finetuning operation
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.7006716728210449;you aimed to drain eur 33 billion from the market and achieved a drain of eur 14 billion from the market
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.5256761312484741;is that too little in your view
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.6219403743743896;what are the reasons
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Negative;0.5977054238319397;noyer we are not disappointed
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9712284803390503;what we had proposed to the market in a very transparent way was the size that for us seemed to be consistent with the immediate return to what i call a neutral liquidity situation
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Negative;0.9163334965705872;now the fact is that the market participants have been more cautious and asked for less
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9382570385932922;that is their judgement and we do respect this
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Negative;0.7589161396026611;it means simply that the return to a neutral liquidity situation will take a little longer
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9874359369277954;it will have to be achieved through our regular refinancing operations starting next week
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9700435996055603;but this will come naturally and we will see how the market behaves

2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.8187687993049622;question mr president
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9409452676773071;in november when you raised interest rates you called it a precautionary move and it seemed because of the rising trend in inflation
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.8707737922668457;it seems so far that your estimate at that time your forecast has not changed and is developing as you expected
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.556358277797699;can we infer from that that if it really will develop like that in the coming months that it will stay below 2 and then decline a bit that this is taken care of by your precautionary move and would not give you a reason to raise interest rates again
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.8308128118515015;duisenberg well you can infer from that anything you want
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9717991352081299;what we have tried to make clear also in my introductory remarks is precisely that this is our expectation of today regarding inflation

2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Negative;0.561862587928772;are you concerned or pleased or whichever by the fact that some formal fiscal competition might develop between different euro countries in the sense of lowering taxes also with the purpose of attracting investmentherr duisenberg that is not a concern i have
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.6914273500442505;an observation which i want to make is that in europe you will see a tendency toward a greater harmonisation of fiscal structures in all areas of fiscality let me call it that
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9450141191482544;but that is a process that has nothing to do with the euro
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9191545844078064;it probably has to do with the phenomenon of the completely free single market in goods services people and capital
2000-01-05;2000;January;REPORT;Neutral;0.9623677134513855;and it is a process which will take if not decades well then maybe even longer
