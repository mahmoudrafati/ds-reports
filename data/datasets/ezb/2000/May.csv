2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9922897219657898;all available indicators and forecasts seem to point to a phase of continued economic growth following the upturn observed in the second half of 1999 industrial production rebounded in february and this together with further increases in capacity utilisation and industrial confidence up to april suggests an ongoing strengthening in industrial activity

2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9047651886940002;however what matters for monetary policy are the trends underlying the outlook for price stability in the medium term
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9580442905426025;in this respect the depreciation of the exchange rate of the euro until it is reversed will increase the risks to price stability in the medium term
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9796525239944458;these risks have to be taken seriously in the light of the current strong upswing
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9674620628356934;other important factors which will have a crucial impact on the outlook for price stability over the medium term are a continuation of currently moderate wage developments a further fiscal consolidation in line with the stability and growth pact and the further implementation of structural reforms in product and labour markets
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9662094116210938;the governing council would like its message to be very clear price stability in the euro area will be maintained and as i already said last week the citizens of europe can be confident that their savings and pensions will keep their value over time
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9886084794998169;price stability will help to turn the current upswing into a long period of high economic growth and falling unemployment and it will strengthen the currency

2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9318070411682129;we are now at your disposal should you have any questions
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.8925783038139343;transcript of the questions asked and the answers given by dr willem f duisenberg president of the ecb and christian noyer vicepresident of the ecb question i have two questions if you will allow me
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Negative;0.8154119253158569;do you think or maybe agree that there is a connection or correlation between the current weakness of the euro and the lack of economic reform in europe
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Negative;0.7524660229682922;the second question would be if that is the case how do you feel about the current strength of the japanese yen visàvis the euro given the even greater lack of economic reform in japan
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9344108700752258;duisenberg first of all as far as structural reforms are concerned almost day after day and press conference after press conference we urge the people the social partners and governments of the euro area to continue to carry out and implement further structural reforms in the labour and product markets
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Positive;0.5915198922157288;and it is a process which is taking place  we do not deny that  but it should be persistent and should take place at a determined and hopefully faster pace than is currently the case
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9618381857872009;to the extent that it does not take place it does have an impact on the views of the outside world visàvis the euro area and with that on the exchange rate of the euro  there is no denying that
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9612724184989929;with regard to japan i would advise you to ask my japanese colleagues that question
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.6921324729919434;and as many things in japan are difficult for us to understand and even more difficult to explain such is the case with the exchange rate of the japanese yen
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Negative;0.8110979795455933;question with the euro hitting some new lows there have been some calls  not too loud  for you perhaps to step down
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Negative;0.7464295625686646;and i want to know how serious this pressure is and how you feel when these rumours hit the markets and the euro actually rises
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.8754445910453796;and the other question i had duisenberg may i answer that question first
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9816626906394958;i have read those rumours just as you have and i am inclined to do the same as the markets are apparently doing ie
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.934711217880249;shrug them off
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.89984530210495;question and the other question i have is could you tell us a little bit about the conversations you have had with the us authorities about the exchange rate
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.5636355876922607;it is clear you want a stronger euro but do the united states want a weaker dollar and what arguments are they presenting
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.917344868183136;duisenberg i cannot tell you anything about the conversations i had with my us colleagues when i met them last weekend in basel
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.8643989562988281;i am not prepared to pursue that conversation further in public
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.91568922996521;question mr president could you please elaborate a little bit more on greece and the position the eu is taking on the membership of greece in the eurosystem
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9554237127304077;the markets do not seem to be very much in favour of greece entering the eurosystem
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.5379067063331604;will this be a consideration for you in the near future or should you perhaps take a stronger stand against greece
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9828804135322571;duisenberg the ecb has issued its convergence report on greece and my colleague mr noyer has presented it to the european parliament
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.884628176689148;and that should say enough
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9714834690093994;that is the judgement that the ecb has given in advising the council of ministers on the state of convergence of the greek economy in the light of the greek request for entry into monetary union
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.8938009738922119;and i really have nothing to add to what has been said in that convergence report
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.8748223185539246;question mr duisenberg as you are aware i am sure there were a lot of rumours in the market yesterday that you may switch to a variable rate tender
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Negative;0.6337834596633911;is that a possibility
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.8882125616073608;how seriously are you considering this and if you are for what reasons
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.6157748699188232;and you have obviously not done so today what is holding you back
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9514440298080444;duisenberg we have obviously not done so today and i will not exclude as i have said before the possibility of our switching to that technique at some time some day
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.7509545087814331;i do not know when
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Negative;0.965857982635498;why we have not done so today is due mainly to the fact that in the very volatile and virulent markets we are experiencing these days we did not want to instil a new element which would again increase uncertainty or volatility or virulence
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.8471644520759583;so let us remain calm
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9453535676002502;question mr president have you discussed the idea of interventions with your colleagues today
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.5169174671173096;have you spoken about it and is this a possibility for you
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.8136176466941833;or is it not possible to go into the markets
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9732166528701782;duisenberg interventions are always a possibility and the only time you will hear me speak about interventions and the deliberations concerning them will be at the time we intervene
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.95772784948349;and i will not comment on that issue at any other time not even on whether discussions have taken place
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.8523455858230591;question mr president looking at the differing remarks of mr fabius and mr schröder lately about the euro there seems to be a vision at the heart of europe about how to treat this question
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9734223484992981;is it a cause of concern to you that the political side has not come up with a clear message visàvis the euro
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.5660731792449951;and my second question mr president given the drop of eur 33 billion in the escb reserves which we have seen over the past five weeks can you deny that this represents covert interventions by escb members and if so are we to expect these reserves to rise again
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9097428917884827;duisenberg last question first yes i would deny that
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.6784330606460571;they were not covert interventions
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.8391721248626709;so the very last question i do not have to answer
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.8096903562545776;returning to the first question on the statements made by mr fabius and mr schröder i have seen them
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9584570527076721;i have listened to them
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9750422239303589;but let me say that those statements were not unwelcome nor were they welcome
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9725651741027832;i would advise you to listen only to me
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.944046139717102;question sorry one more thing i asked if you deny it are we to expect that these reserves are going to rise the next few weeks
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.7455648183822632;duisenberg i do not know
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9595236778259277;if these were  and they were  normal commercial transactions then you should not expect anything from this phenomenon in coming weeks
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Negative;0.550926685333252;question you have already told us that you are not inclined to resign
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.7777814865112305;but i have two questions
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Negative;0.760959804058075;one is does the european central bank share any blame at all for the decline in the euro
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.824463427066803;and secondly what is your view of the proposal that the euro11 need more cohesive economic government as a counterbalance to the european central bank
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.6999315023422241;duisenberg first of all i am not prepared to take any blame for the decline in the euro although i realise that markets may do so
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.5582282543182373;but i do not share that blame
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.8074074983596802;and do we need an economic government
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.5548797249794006;i think not
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9470700025558472;i think cooperation between the responsible euro area ministers of finance and economics in the context of the euro11 and their continuing dialogue with the european central bank are a very acceptable even agreeable situation which does not to my mind point in the direction of institutional political developments which would be different from those in progress
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9637651443481445;question mr president do you expect that the current exchange rate of the euro will have any effect on the enlargement process of the european union
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.8146440982818604;duisenberg i do not
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9730396866798401;question translation last friday you said that you understood that the citizens of europe were concerned about the weakness of the euro
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9167859554290771;people who read that text consider that you do not feel responsible for that
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.6349194645881653;and there is internal stability
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.7821559906005859;but do you think political factors within the european union are responsible for this
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9069486856460571;and why do you not point the finger more clearly at what you consider to be political responsibilities
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9582690000534058;duisenberg i did not wish to engage in a debate on the whys and ifs of the developments in the exchange rate
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9535571336746216;what i merely wished to do was to convey the feeling to the citizens of europe that they should not be concerned about these exchange rate developments as they increasingly tended to be in view of the value  the intrinsic value  of their money the euro and of the intrinsic value of their savings and pensions
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9438660740852356;because we are achieving the main thing that we at the ecb have been hired for  it is to maintain price stability and to pass that price stability on to future generations to people who are saving or building up a pension and to their children
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9389091730117798;that is our main goal and it is a goal which we are capable of achieving
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.7232436537742615;question i have just two brief questions for you
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9300062656402588;first of all without actually going into detail on the meetings with your american colleagues could you just say whom you met with if that is possible
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9356666207313538;i was also wondering whether you could give us some kind of guidance on how you can stop the different european ministers from saying something different about the euro
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.7476801872253418;is there anything you could do to shut them up
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.8789861798286438;duisenberg whom did i meet over the weekend
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9221199154853821;we had a regular meeting as we have every month of the g10 central bank governors to which i am grateful to be invited as the 11th representative of the g10
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9235926866531372;so i met all the colleagues i meet every month including the american ones
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9529224634170532;and these are mr greenspan mr mcdonough mr hayami mr trichet mr welteke mr wellink  and to rephrase your last question in a slightly less antagonistic way we make every effort we can to let those ministers and ourselves all governors speak in a choir with one voice
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Positive;0.929468035697937;and i think that mr noyer did a great job in achieving just that last monday when he was in brussels attending the euro11 ministers of finance meeting while i was attending the g10 meeting in basel
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9615283608436584;mr noyer succeeded as you will all have noticed in getting the ministers to speak with one voice and not to point in different directions
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.7170110940933228;question mr duisenberg you have stressed again that you think the current exchange rate is not in line with the fundamentals
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.6318710446357727;why and where have the markets lost the ability to come to the right judgement or conclusions
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.965440034866333;or is it possibly true that the current exchange rate does reflect beyond gdp forecasts the prospects for the euro area
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Negative;0.5679948329925537;duisenberg well if the current exchange rate is compared with the exchange rate for the euro over the period  let us say  two years before the euro came into existence a period in which growth forecasts unemployment figures and inflation figures were far  i dont want to say worse  less good than at present then the fact that the exchange rate has clearly fallen below that level for some time now indicates to me that it may well be that the markets have overshot the level which would be appropriate for an economy which has such a strong growth potential which is actually realising that potential which will realise a healthy balance of payments surplus for the foreseeable future and which is realising a climate of price stability  in terms of price increases in the foreseeable future ie
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9451506733894348;over the next two years  which will remain below the ceiling we have defined as the limit for acceptable price movements namely 2
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.8464738726615906;question since i am new in frankfurt  i have just come from tokyo  please forgive me if i am too rude or irreverent
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9693854451179504;in the tokyo market an intervention is regarded as a sort of convenient manoeuvring tool for the central bank
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Negative;0.6872202157974243;it is surprising for me to see how reluctant and careful the ecb is
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9756794571876526;and would you kindly reiterate the basic stance of the ecb in order to explain when and under what conditions you basically think an intervention is possible

2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9005762338638306;duisenberg it is good to see that you realise that there are differences between tokyo and frankfurt
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9556474089622498;but i would not be very consistent in my stance if i were to answer your question when i did not answer the first question which was put to me
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.8871259689331055;no further comments on interventions
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9187790751457214;question mr duisenberg i still have some problems with your statement on the euro
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Negative;0.5539777278900146;you just said  i am trying to look at it through the eyes of a citizen of an ordinary citizen and not as an economist  you just pointed out and i quote i am not prepared to take any blame for the decline in the euro
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.8885965347290039;and then you said what i merely wished to do was to convey the feeling to the citizens of europe that  i summarise  you are keeping prices stable
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.640873372554779;so to me looking at it as a citizen there is contradiction
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.8363766670227051;because when you read the statement as a citizen you try to have confidence in mr duisenberg that he is also trying to get and keep the exchange rate more or less stable
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.698318362236023;that is my first question do you see a contradiction
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.8718124032020569;second question how great is the effect of a low or falling exchange rate on import prices and how do you calculate that
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9329044818878174;do you work with models or what is the procedure
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.8709186911582947;duisenberg well the most important question if i may call it that is the first one of course
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.8018180131912231;there is no contradiction
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.6336714625358582;but what has been happening over the last couple of weeks
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9939829707145691;across europe people at large have become concerned about all they have read and heard about their having a weak currency
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9511456489562988;what i wished to convey to the public at large was that if you talk about a currency and its weakness you also have to look at in technical terms the internal value of the currency
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9735950827598572;and so how can one call a currency which is characterised by stable prices a weak currency
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.8480527400970459;i do not
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9552615284919739;it is only the external value which you refer to
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9406797885894775;but i wanted to impress on the people who were becoming concerned about the value of their property their savings and their pensions that there was no danger at all
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Negative;0.5312389731407166;and as long as the ecb is there  may i say as long as i am there  there will be no danger
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9325305223464966;the second question is very simple to answer
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9825209975242615;we have models we have good reasoning so that we know what the proportion of imports in our gpd is euro areawide
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9869992136955261;so we can calculate what impact a persistent exchange rate level as compared with a previous period will have on import prices
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.8567046523094177;and that is i must say rather limited
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9579768776893616;question and the figure  10  of the exchange rate
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9034544229507446;how much will that be
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.7734507918357849;duisenberg that depends on how long it lasts
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9819485545158386;if it persists it would add to inflation  a few decimals of a percentage point
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9433784484863281;question translation president duisenberg the german stock exchange is now merging with the london stock exchange

2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9620323181152344;that is the way things look at the moment
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.5164136290550232;now how do you feel about this
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.6882320642471313;are you happy with this
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.8323655128479004;that is the first thing
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9033143520355225;and the second question is has the european capital market not come to a halt because international investors and us investors if they buy shares in euro want to have the same securities supervision and so on
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9743276238441467;duisenberg first of all i was not aware that the merger between the london and frankfurt stock exchanges meant that everything would go through london
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Negative;0.5291202664375305;i thought not
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9803910255432129;and i think that the merger of the amsterdam brussels and paris stock exchanges will not mean that everything will go either to amsterdam or to brussels or to paris

2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9478239417076111;what is true is that the unification of the market into one big european capital market is taking place at a slower pace than the unification at the short end of the market in the money market
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.8676393628120422;in the money market we have seen within days of the introduction of the euro the development of one large european money market

2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.8458113670349121;that is still dividing the capital market up into segments but there is development
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9420531988143921;it may take another decade before we can speak of one large european capital market
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.6030537486076355;it will be denominated in euro there is no doubt about that
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9836904406547546;it already is but it will take time before the instruments traded in the capital market are completely comparable and tradable anywhere in europe or anywhere in the world on the same footing

2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.8409687876701355;do you think that could challenge the compromise that was arrived at in may 1998 and if there were to be a change would that change your own personal plans
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9515965580940247;duisenberg i will not in any event comment on my personal plans or on the position of president of the ecb as i had promised the press that i would not do so at any time in the future
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9041363000869751;so i will not do that
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Positive;0.9178085923194885;as far as mr trichet is concerned i will simply say at the time when the judicial investigation started and was made public the comité monétaire in france published a communiqué of three lines stating that it continued to fully support and have confidence in governor trichet as the chairman of the committee
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9687336087226868;if they had asked me to do so i would have joined them in that communiqué

2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.6788360476493835;we are concerned but may i ask mr noyer to express our concern noyer we are in fact concerned  not about a certain level but about certain developments which have occurred and about the fact that there may be fewer automatic stabilisers in that respect than may have existed in various financial centres before
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9556326270103455;we have studied this quite extensively
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9900380373001099;we have studied a number of tools that could permit us to rule out any excessive developments in the same direction

2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.7565544843673706;but the question was are you concerned and can you do something about it
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Negative;0.9580411314964294;yes we are concerned
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9834158420562744;we are monitoring the situation very closely and we are developing tools that could be used in due course if necessary
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.8758270144462585;question i have come from even further away than tokyo
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.7874125838279724;the question i have because i find it quite interesting is it was reported that your statement on friday was quite unprecedented and i realise that there are not really many precedents in the history of the ecb it is fairly young
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.959572970867157;i was wondering because of the nature of that statement in that it was directed to the public to the citizens of europe whether you had any conversations with the constituent national government leaders before releasing that statement on what its content should be or indeed did they suggest to you perhaps even pressure you  however gently  to make this statement at this time
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Negative;0.8527550101280212;given the political implications all the risks seem to be greater than the economic ones

2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.7895026206970215;question it just occurred to me that perhaps surprisingly no question has yet been asked about interest rates
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.9332846403121948;so i guess i am going to play devils advocate and ask that question
2000-05-11;2000;May;REPORT;Neutral;0.4894959628582001;the question is simply are you still on a tightening path are any animals still creeping or running at this point
