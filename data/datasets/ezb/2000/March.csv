2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9465429186820984;ecb press conference introductory statement willem f duisenberg president of the european central bank christian noyer vicepresident of the european central bank frankfurt am main 2 march 2000 with the transcript of the questions and answers ladies and gentlemen the vicepresident and i are here today to report on the outcome of todays meetings of the general council and the governing council of the ecb
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9873831868171692;the governing council conducted its regular examination of the outlook for price developments in the euro area
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.991431713104248;after reviewing the evidence available from both the first and the second pillar of the monetary policy strategy of the eurosystem the governing council decided to maintain the interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the eurosystem at 325 and the interest rate on the marginal lending facility and that on the deposit facility at 425 and 225 respectively ie
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9716970324516296;at the levels determined a month ago
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Positive;0.7940931916236877;the governing council also concluded that the balance of risks to price stability in the medium term remains on the upside
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9538695216178894;these upside risks will need to be monitored and assessed continuously in order to ensure that timely action can be taken if and when required
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9703153371810913;the main elements of our assessment of the latest information on monetary financial market and other economic developments are as follows
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9571731686592102;starting with the monetary indicators covered under the first pillar of the monetary policy strategy the threemonth average of the annual growth rates of m3 for the period from november 1999 to january 2000 was 57 compared with 60 in the last quarter of 1999 the reduction was determined by a base effect since the monthly increase in m3 in january 1999 was exceptionally strong reflecting the special environment at the start of stage three of economic and monetary union
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Positive;0.8977624773979187;at the same time the annual growth rate of credit to the private sector remained high at 95 in january 2000 overall the prolonged deviation of m3 growth from the reference value of 4Â½ especially when seen in conjunction with the dynamic growth of credit indicates that liquidity conditions in the euro area remain generous
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.985139787197113;with regard to the second pillar as usual the governing council examined a broad range of indicators
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9666633605957031;starting with longterm nominal interest rates there was little change in the course of february
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Positive;0.992760419845581;the yield curve remained relatively steep thus indicating expectations of strong economic growth in the period ahead
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9034537672996521;such expectations are partly based on the favourable outlook for the world economy
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9911852478981018;a key element underlying this positive outlook is the fact that the us economy is continuing to grow at a high rate but the strong recovery and the acceleration of growth in other areas also support this view
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9855947494506836;the strongest level of performance is currently being recorded in emerging market economies in southeast asia while the broad outlook in japan remains uncertain
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9920107126235962;there is also further evidence that economic activity in the euro area continued to expand strongly after the third quarter of last year
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9916133880615234;while euro area estimates for the fourth quarter of 1999 are not yet available data for individual member states point to continued robust output growth
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9770920872688293;in addition areawide industrial confidence increased further around the turn of the year and consumer confidence remained at the high level reached in the last two months of 1999 the cyclical upswing should extend well into 2000 and continue thereafter
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9502091407775879;this is also confirmed by available forecasts which point to real gdp growth of slightly over 3 in 2000 as for 2001 the economic expansion in the euro area is generally expected to continue at a similar pace
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9918975830078125;developments in the exchange rate of the euro which do not reflect the underlying strength of the euro area economy remain a cause for concern
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9899594783782959;their upward impact on import prices is having a negative effect on the price climate and is thereby increasing the risks to price stability in the medium term
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9093982577323914;with regard to most recent developments in consumer price inflation as measured by annual increases in the harmonised index of consumer prices hicp the upward movement has continued
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9873499274253845;in january 2000 the annual rate of hicp inflation was 20 up from 17 in december 1999 as in earlier months the latest upward movement is the result of the increase in energy prices which on an annual basis reached 120 in january
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9457018375396729;excluding the more volatile components namely energy and seasonal food hicp inflation in january increased slightly to 11 on account of somewhat higher price increases for nonenergy industrial goods
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9774659872055054;while it is likely that annual inflation rates will fall again in the course of 2000 owing to base effects related to the price of oil monetary policymakers need to look beyond developments over the next few months ie
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8970147967338562;policy will need to focus on the risks to price stability in the medium term
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9858654737472534;indeed whereas most forecasts still point to average inflation of below 2 in 2000 and 2001 they are based on rather favourable assumptions and generally seem to imply a pattern which is characterised first by decreasing rates of inflation in the course of this year and then by more fundamental upward tendencies later on
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9206011891365051;against this background the governing council concluded that vigilance is required and pointed to several factors
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9817410111427307;first developments in monetary and credit aggregates will need to be analysed continuously in order to assess upward risks to price stability
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Positive;0.5081111788749695;second in view of the improving economic conditions the potential spillover of large and protracted increases in import and producer prices into consumer prices will need to be assessed carefully
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8417840003967285;in this context developments in the exchange rate and in oil prices will play a major role
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Positive;0.8292945623397827;it will be essential both for maintaining price stability and for reducing the high level of unemployment that wage settlements remain moderate and do not themselves contribute to inflation expectations which would also endanger the sustainability of the current upswing
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9846411347389221;fiscal policies can make a substantive contribution to maintaining favourable economic conditions by using the current upswing as an excellent opportunity to proceed swiftly towards fulfilling the objectives of the stability and growth pact
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9869412779808044;economic conditions and perspectives in the euro area appear to be better at present than at any time in the past decade
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9780703186988831;growth is strong employment is expected to increase further and the still very high level of unemployment should continue to fall
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9899559020996094;remaining vigilant to counter upside risks to price stability and pursuing structural reform is the foundation for a sustained period of strong economic growth and a lasting process of job creation
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.973990261554718;finally i should like to draw your attention to two items not directly linked to todays meeting of the governing council
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9763678312301636;first i should like to inform you that on 30 march 2000 the governing council will meet for the first time outside frankfurt namely in madrid
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9654665589332581;the meeting will be followed by a press conference
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9890151619911194;it is our intention that governing council meetings will be held in other euro area member states twice a year
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9492184519767761;in the second half of this year it is envisaged that the governing council will meet in paris
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9727264642715454;second on 2 and 3 november 2000 the ecb will hold its first central banking conference
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.7555724382400513;the topic of the conference will be why price stability
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9598937034606934;and it will take place in frankfurt
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9495037198066711;the ecbs central banking conference which will be organised biennially will bring together invited participants from central banks international and european institutions academia and the press
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9634443521499634;as of today regularly updated information including a preliminary programme will be provided on the ecbs web site
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9693331122398376;the final programme for the conference and all the papers comments and a summary of the discussions will be made available on the ecbs web site in due course
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9318070411682129;we are now at your disposal should you have any questions
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.7234246134757996;transcript of the questions asked and the answers given by dr willem f duisenberg president of the ecb and christian noyer vicepresident of the ecb question mr duisenberg when you last moved up interest rates in early february you said  or you explained in newspaper interviews afterwards  that you moved and did the move earlier than you would have otherwise due to the weakness of the euro against the dollar
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Negative;0.7194445133209229;now you explained all these dangers to price stability once again
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8955922722816467;you mentioned the exchange rate again
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9248785972595215;why do the same reasons that applied in early february not apply now
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Negative;0.5607130527496338;duisenberg well let me say this on the basis of the statement i have just made there can be no doubt in anyones mind as to the direction in which monetary policy will be moving in the near future
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.922405481338501;on the precise timing of the move i have as little information as you have
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Negative;0.6050719022750854;question translation first of all mr president how do you explain the continuing weakness of the euro on the exchange markets
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9036360383033752;do you have an explanation for that
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8651915192604065;and then a question for mr noyer if i may
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Negative;0.8758131265640259;the anglosaxon press mr noyer accused you of weakening the euro last week because of an interview
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.789673924446106;what do you have to say to those accusations
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.737529993057251;duisenberg i have a partial explanation
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9672864675521851;and it is mainly of course the differential between the economic performance in the united states and that in europe
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9706231951713562;in the united states there are a surprisingly and fantastically high continued rate of growth and very low unemployment but no signs of any inflationary pressures
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9471761584281921;in europe we have an economy that is picking up strongly due to the oil prices and the exchange rate itself with some indications that the risks for inflation are on the upside
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9800884127616882;those differences are the main explanations for the development of the exchange rate
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9589253664016724;but of course you can explain anything with the benefit of hindsight
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9784852862358093;i would like to repeat as i explicitly did in my statement that we are of the conviction given the prospects for both the european and the us economy that the euro has the potential to strengthen in the future
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9334944486618042;but do not ask me when ask me why
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8963047862052917;the why i have answered the when i cannot answer
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.7782530784606934;noyer what i said i can repeat today
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9008596539497375;it is extremely simple
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.989862322807312;we have already said it 100 times namely that the monthly bulletin which is issued approximately one week after the statement of the president ie
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9729019999504089;a statement of the kind the president has just made is not sending and will never send messages differing from that in the introductory statement
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9664875268936157;it elaborates on the same message
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9796292185783386;and actually there is one single message coming from the governing council the message that you have just heard from the president
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9788570404052734;and all the members may elaborate on that give explanations in their own words but the message is the same
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9444357752799988;i never understood why here and there attempts are made to set off what was said by one against that said by another
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9829810857772827;there is one single message coming from the governing council
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8706997632980347;and you have just heard it
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.7377466559410095;question mr duisenberg i have never really heard you as hawkish as i have today
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Negative;0.5544527173042297;and i have to wonder why the ecb did not perhaps move today
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9494878053665161;and if perhaps there is a feeling that the ecb was afraid of being perceived as acting on a weaker exchange rate
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Negative;0.8558358550071716;and the other question i have is there are some signs that the oil supply is going to increase
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8844420313835144;what does that mean for your outlook
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.5418523550033569;duisenberg on the last question i have not seen those signs yet
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.711617648601532;but it may well be that if the supply increases the upward movement in oil prices could be reversed
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Positive;0.7431158423423767;that would be a very welcome signal and indicator for us
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9577599167823792;as to your argument that you have never heard me so hawkish well the signs are increasing that risks to price stability are growing
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.981745183467865;this also applies to our forecasts and to those of others which stated that price developments will settle just below the 2 level
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9849420785903931;the risks to these forecasts are increasing
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9547949433326721;and then you have to remember that we raised rates by 50 basis points only four months ago and by another 14 percentage point only one month ago
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.6456741094589233;so altogether this increase of 34 of a percentage point in rates still has to work its way through into the economy and we are not under the illusion that we can finetune either inflation developments or real economic developments by pursuing an activist policy
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Negative;0.7169294357299805;but i would just like to give the warning that the risks seem to be increasing
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.7406477928161621;that is why i say that there cannot be any doubt in anybodys mind as to the direction of future monetary policy
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.7205667495727539;question i have two questions
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Negative;0.8364946842193604;one concerns m3
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9154759049415588;what is your estimate of the m3 overhang from last year
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9578529596328735;could you give us a percentage in relation to the whole aggregate
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9250019788742065;and the second question concerns financial supervision in the union
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9483534097671509;is there any intention on the part of the ecb to play a more active role in financial supervision and would you think it necessary to create a unified authority for a comprehensive supervision of securities banking and insurance companies
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9053658843040466;duisenberg christian do you have any idea about the first question
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9758936166763306;noyer i would not dare to give a precise figure but you cannot simply base assumptions on the difference between the actual outcome of m3 at the end of 1999 and the reference value because there were special factors at the beginning of the year
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.979873538017273;so in order to answer your question properly we should base our reasoning on special calculations which i do not have with me now
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9547661542892456;so i am sorry for not being able to answer but what is important is that it is not as simple as it may look
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9638692140579224;duisenberg as far as supervision is concerned you know that the treaty gives the ecb only a rather limited role namely that of promoting sound supervisory practices in the individual member states
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9886288642883301;but supervision itself explicitly falls under the principle of subsidiarity and will be executed at a national level
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8942996859550476;the ecb has no aspirations to change that situation
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9385636448860168;we are actively involved in the further development of supervision but in a coordinating role and in the interests of financial stability at large
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9364637136459351;so i do not see any tendency towards creating a supranational supervisory body nor a body encompassing all the financial activities you mentioned in the sphere of security settlement banking and insurance
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9671851992607117;as to how that should be organised i have my personal views on that
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9527704119682312;but we follow developments in the various countries with great interest
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9852559566497803;what we do feel is that it would be wise for national central banks to remain closely involved in whatever way in the entire process of supervision
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8986020088195801;question i would like to follow up on the issue of comments from the central bank
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.7498855590820312;there has been major confusion in the markets when members of the central bank comment on your policy  whether you are looking backwards to explain or whether you are looking forwards to prepare the market
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9838663935661316;and i think there is some confusion even today
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8543673157691956;are you explaining what you have been doing or are you trying to prepare the market
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9589559435844421;is there not a need to clarify the direction on which the central bank is commenting
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Negative;0.6108868718147278;duisenberg well i do not think that my statement of today  as i have said before  can leave any doubt about what we have been doing
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9663424491882324;i gave you a report on what we have been doing in a forwardlooking manner explaining what we think the future will have in store for us and what our policy reactions to that future development are going to be

2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.4769836664199829;and if so what exactly would you mean by a stronger euro
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.7998189330101013;how much more does it have to rise
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9009689092636108;second question is there anything else that we journalists from the economic press should know today that was said in the council but that we do not have in your statement
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.912912905216217;duisenberg as to a percentage  i cannot give you one
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Positive;0.8809088468551636;what we are strongly interested in what we do believe is that  may i paraphrase my american colleague  a strong euro is in the interests of europe
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Positive;0.8890625834465027;so we are interested in a strong euro
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9891757369041443;we are concerned about the recent development of the euro for two reasons
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.882519543170929;first because of the potential impact it can have on domestic ie
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Negative;0.7411513924598694;european inflation and the psychological impact it can have on the credibility of and the confidence in our currency
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9606427550315857;we are therefore interested mostly in a stable euro
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.7276483178138733;whether you call it strong or weak i do not really care all that much
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.5497382879257202;but stability is what we care for most and then a strong euro  i repeat myself  is in the interests of europe
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8495693802833557;the second question are there any other matters which would interest you
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.7608951330184937;i do not think so
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Negative;0.5960508584976196;question to the extent that not much has really changed between the two meetings in terms of economic fundamentals
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.6882142424583435;to what extent were you able to focus on other issues today
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8226375579833984;i am thinking more about communications policy
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9570903778076172;duisenberg our communications policy has not changed
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9480850100517273;we did notice that we were widely reported  as reflected in the last but one question  as seeming to create diverging views and confusion in markets
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9893053770065308;we are concerned about that
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9226381778717041;and there was strong urging from all sides in the governing council that we should see to it that  if we could not speak with one mouth preferably with one mouth we should at least let only one voice be heard
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9328545928001404;question the two reuters correspondents are teaming up so i have got three questions if you allow  two people though
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9422816634178162;first of all you said earlier in a response to a question that the 075 percentage point rate hike you conducted in the last few months still needed to work its way through into the economy
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8247506618499756;do you have any idea how long that takes
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9149430990219116;second question the euro fell to a historic low on monday in asia then recovered sharply after that
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.5304937362670898;markets speculated that maybe the ecb was intervening in the markets
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8843638896942139;can you give us an indication whether the ecb actually was in the markets as far as the euro is concerned
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.7387698888778687;and the third question is whether you see  relating to asset prices to equity prices in particular  whether you see a bubble there that is about to burst possibly
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9810498356819153;duisenberg the first question as to how long the lags are with which monetary policy measures work their way through into the economy it is generally estimated that the lags are in the order of six to eight quarters
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9687801003456116;so let us say around one and a half years
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9531108736991882;those are the lags we reckon with in formulating our monetary policy
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9556900858879089;i cannot give you any specific information on monday
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8914499282836914;the ecb was not in the market in the hectic developments last monday
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8313896059989929;we know that one party in tokyo was in the market precisely at lunchtime and that caused some turbulence but it was not a central bank i can assure you
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9246758818626404;and your third question question asset price bubble duisenberg yes asset price bubble
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.851183295249939;i did not forget this question i did not want to answer that question
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9398802518844604;question mr duisenberg earlier this week the oecd published reports on the first year of monetary union and it made the point that in its view one of the main reasons for the dissonance in voices was that some national central bank governors had been making public statements based on the interests of their own particular country rather than the interests of the 11nation area as a whole
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Negative;0.6388239860534668;is that a criticism that you regard as fair
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8736963868141174;duisenberg i do not regard it as fair
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Positive;0.9438676834106445;i must confess that it did strike me from the conclusions that one newspaper close to your heart drew from the same oecd report you referred to that the oecd was very critical of the ecbs first year while another newspaper namely le monde concluded from that very same oecd report that the oecd had been extremely gracious that the oecd had been very positive about the ecb
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9739358425140381;so there you see once again it is the same message which may be interpreted differently in practice
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9529692530632019;noyer if i may add much the same to what you have just mentioned for le monde also appeared if i remember correctly in the handelsblatt les echos and probably in other sources
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.7172350883483887;question since last december i believe you have been sending warning signals about the wage deals that were and are under way and so did mr noyer and practically all of your colleagues
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.913963258266449;now that some agreements have been finalised have been closed this season do you have any comments to make
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.5398617386817932;do you think they took notice of your warning signals
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9742497801780701;duisenberg so far actual wage settlements as concluded do not give rise to concern
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8197534680366516;the major contracts still have to be concluded
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Negative;0.9659856557846069;and there are signals at least in the demands that the contracts could be excessive
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.915232241153717;but then i want to emphasise wage demands are not wage contracts yet
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Negative;0.4453046917915344;but it would be fine to say so far so good
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9575352072715759;question the swedish ruling party is deciding to join emu this coming weekend and there has been discussion as to whether this erm rule ie
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.7788395285606384;twoyear erm membership will apply or whether it will be enough that there has been a stable exchange rate or will be it held against sweden that the kroner has been stronger than the euro
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9773479700088501;duisenberg well the erm rules or the criteria prescribe that a currency should  apart from membership in the erm  have been stable and should certainly not have depreciated in the two years preceding actual entry into monetary union
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8825514912605286;so that could not be held against sweden in any way
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9877614974975586;when a country applies for membership of the european union the european central bank will have to draw up a convergence report and make an assessment of the extent to which that particular country fulfils the entrance criteria as have been formulated in the maastricht treaty
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9868870377540588;and certainly for the european central bank membership in erm ii which is clearly prescribed as one of the criteria to be fulfilled will be used in the convergence report of the ecb as one of the yardsticks for our advice
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.983509361743927;but i want to point out in addition that it is not the ecb that will take the ultimate decision but the european council on the advice of the european central bank and of the european commission
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8283112049102783;questions but there have been exceptions to the twoyear rule earlier duisenberg yes but that was a political decision
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9336729645729065;they were only tiny exceptions only a matter of months
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9213813543319702;you are talking about italy i assume
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8783827424049377;that is the only exception i can remember
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9902004599571228;it was only a matter of months and the political decision was based on the duration of membership and the period of stability preceding actual membership in the erm
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.6262898445129395;so i hope for this weekend that it is enough
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.6863309741020203;question mr president coming back to financial supervision

2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.7078577280044556;now have you changed your mind or might it just  duisenberg if i was quoted that way i was wrongly quoted
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9816276431083679;what my personal opinion was and what it has always been is that banking supervision should be in the hands of or closely associated with the national central banks
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Negative;0.5927278995513916;and i am still of that opinion
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8700145483016968;question translation mr duisenberg does the ecb support mr kochwesers candidacy for the imf
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.7129616737365723;and there is rumour that mr tietmeyer may be put forward
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.7455564737319946;what do you think of that
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8539784550666809;duisenberg the european central bank is not a member of the imf so we have nothing to do with the issue

2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.9498617649078369;question translation but you surely have an opinion on that
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.8486253619194031;question translation i had the same question
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Neutral;0.65361088514328;i would nevertheless like to ask it again in another way if the euro exchange rate has an upward potential would you not agree that global factors are what is impeding a come back of the euro as is for instance the confrontation between the united states and europe on this issue and on other fundamental issues of global policy
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Negative;0.7804872393608093;duisenberg well whenever there are uncertainties and risks for a certain currency area  in this case europe  that have the tendency to weaken a currency  and this goes for the united states and for europe  there could certainly be a political impact
2000-03-02;2000;March;REPORT;Negative;0.8383991718292236;but when the image presented is one of disunity of uncertainty of a lack of strong and unified will that is never good for a currency
