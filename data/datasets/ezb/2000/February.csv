2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9442322850227356;ecb press conference introductory statement willem f duisenberg president of the european central bank christian noyer vicepresident of the european central bank frankfurt am main 3 february 2000 with the transcript of the questions and answers ladies and gentlemen the vicepresident and i are here today to report on the outcome of todays meeting of the governing council of the ecb
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9878984093666077;at todays meeting the governing council decided to increase the ecb interest rates by 25 basis points
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9901204109191895;as a consequence the forthcoming main refinancing operations of the eurosystem will be conducted as fixed rate tenders at an interest rate of 325 starting with the operation to be settled on 9 february 2000 in addition the interest rate on the marginal lending facility will be increased from 40 to 425 and that on the deposit facility from 20 to 225 both with effect from 4 february 2000 these decisions were taken on the basis of an assessment of the risks to price stability in the medium term in the context of the eurosystems monetary policy strategy
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9557408094406128;considering the first pillar of this strategy both monetary and credit growth continue to signal generous liquidity conditions
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9356774091720581;monetary growth has consistently been above the reference value and credit to the private sector is continuing to grow at more than 10
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8110060095787048;these developments are indicative of upside risks to price stability in the medium term
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9426972270011902;as for the second pillar of the monetary policy strategy price and cost increases  including oil and nonenergy commodity prices as well as producer prices  have been larger and more protracted than foreseen earlier and hence indicate risks of second round effects
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9871600866317749;such risks which are of a more enduring nature are further increased by the fact that the international environment is showing continuous signs of improvement and the prospects of a cyclical upswing in the euro area are very strong
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Positive;0.8073262572288513;indeed internal and external factors reinforce one another and thereby contribute to intensifying the growth of the real gdp of the euro area
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9333194494247437;the depreciation of the euro which we have witnessed is contributing to increases in import prices
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.6250178217887878;timely and appropriate monetary policy adjustments should ensure that these risks are kept under control so that risk premia in financial markets will be diminished
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Positive;0.46896034479141235;the governing councils determination to counter threats of inflation should assure wage negotiators that the prospects for price stability remain favourable
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9575138092041016;in fact it will be important to ensure that wage settlements themselves do not constitute a threat to price stability in the medium term
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.91566401720047;allow me to give you a more detailed overview of the main elements of our assessment of the latest information on monetary financial market and other economic developments
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9767405390739441;starting with the first pillar there has been an upward movement in most recent monetary developments in the euro area
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9804644584655762;base effects have largely contributed to the fact that the threemonth average of the annual growth rate of m3  covering the period from october to december 1999  rose to 61 after having stood at 60 in the threemonth period ending in november 1999 at 105 the annual growth rate of credit to the private sector continued to be high in december 1999 considering the prolonged deviation of m3 growth from the reference value of 4 12 throughout 1999 as well as the ongoing strong expansion of credit monetary and credit developments observed remain an important factor contributing to the upside risks to price stability
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Positive;0.6666953563690186;turning to the second pillar longterm nominal interest rates signal increased expectations of a lasting upswing in the euro area economy
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9919655323028564;between the end of december 1999 and the end of january 2000 tenyear government bond yields in the euro area increased further to reach the highest level observed since late 1997 developments in the exchange rate of the euro are becoming a cause for concern with regard to future price stability
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Negative;0.8921791911125183;at the end of january the nominal effective exchange rate of the euro stood approximately 11 12 below its level in the first quarter of 1999 given both the magnitude and the duration of this development import prices can be expected to rise further thereby increasing the risk that upward pressures on consumer price inflation might materialise in the medium term
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Positive;0.988756000995636;it is all the more important to take such risks into account given that the outlook for the world economy has improved further
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9561457633972168;there are increasing signs that the upturn in world growth has become more broadly based across economic areas
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9923269152641296;in addition to the us economy continuing to enjoy robust growth activity is also accelerating in other industrialised countries and the recovery is strong in both asian and latin american emerging market economies
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.978581964969635;euro area growth developments are in line with global trends
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9923770427703857;following the acceleration in real gdp growth from the second to the third quarter of 1999 economic activity in the euro area can also be expected to have seen a strong expansion in the last quarter of 1999 inter alia the high level of industrial and consumer confidence reached in the last quarter of 1999 and the prospect of ongoing employment growth and further falling unemployment as reflected in most recent data all point to ongoing improvements
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9816678762435913;with regard to consumer price developments the rate of inflation  as measured by increases in the harmonised index of consumer prices hicp  has moved up further
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9687256217002869;the rise in the annual rate of change in the overall hicp from 15 in november to 17 in december 1999 was almost entirely due to an annual increase in energy prices
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Positive;0.6321663856506348;our expectation is that we shall see higher inflation rates in the next few months
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9715713262557983;inflation rates are now approaching higher levels than expected earlier and larger and more protracted commodity and producer price increases are heightening the risk of second round effects
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.6471502184867859;against this background it is crucial for wage negotiators to be able to rely on the maintenance of price stability in the medium term
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Positive;0.741191029548645;in conclusion it is the responsibility of the governing council to maintain price stability thereby contributing to ensuring sustainable growth in the euro area
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.6567122936248779;in order to maintain price stability monetary policy needs to act in a forwardlooking manner counteracting external and domestic risks in a timely fashion
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Positive;0.6588041186332703;growth in the euro area is now robust and in order to maintain favourable conditions for a lasting economic expansion social partners will need to keep wage increases consistent with price stability as well as compatible with continued growth in employment
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.5656293034553528;governments will have to enhance the structural reform process in order to strengthen the economy in a durable manner
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9566069841384888;such reforms will not only make a great contribution to the euro area remaining attractive for domestic investors but will also contribute to increasing its attractiveness for investors located abroad
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9792967438697815;overall consistently acting in line with these responsibilities appears to be most conducive to maintaining price stability at the domestic level and to ensuring robust growth
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Positive;0.4909626245498657;this will lead to a strengthening of the euro
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9884918928146362;indeed a strong economy goes along with a strong currency
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9318070411682129;we are now at your disposal should you have any questions
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.5343103408813477;transcript of the questions asked and the answers given by dr willem f duisenberg president of the ecb and christian noyer vicepresident of the ecb question translation mr president why did you not believe it advisable to wait a little longer to see whether the increase in interest rates of november leads to lower m3 growth rates
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.7850412130355835;duisenberg because what we expect regarding the movements in m3 in the coming months is that they will be very much influenced by base effects and that they will be very difficult to interpret
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8357153534889221;that is one thing
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9482142925262451;we expect  just for statistical reasons  to see lower figures in the coming months
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.5645454525947571;and why wait
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Negative;0.7480311989784241;if you are convinced that all indicators as well as the two pillars on which our monetary policy strategy is based are already now pointing towards increased risks to price stability  and that does include recent developments in the exchange rate which cannot be ignored and which is one of the main indicators we look at  then we were afraid to wait
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Negative;0.5556633472442627;if we had waited we would have run the risk honestly of being forced to do more than we are currently doing in the future
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.6755130290985107;question mr duisenberg it seems to me that there is a danger here  and the big picture is  that the euro area could have its policy mix dictated by what is going on in the united states
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9384422898292542;in other words we are importing inflation but a great deal in fact the major part of what is happening in commodity prices and producer prices as a result is happening as a result of the fact that commodities and raw materials etc leaving aside the oil prices for a minute are denominated in us dollars
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.960421085357666;my question to you is this if commodities were not denominated in us dollars we would not have those import price rises of above 8 that we have at the moment
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.939978837966919;would you have raised rates today if commodities were denominated in euro
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.706247091293335;duisenberg well that is a very hypothetical question
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Negative;0.5053713917732239;my mother always said if the skies are falling down all the birds would be dead
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9296066761016846;so i would rather not comment on that
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.7571709156036377;question we have been pulled along by the united states
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9512049555778503;duisenberg pulled along by the united states
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.730603814125061;no
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9388256669044495;we are of course influenced by developments in the united states we are being influenced by the startling phenomenon of a continued extremely and even surprisingly high rate of growth in the united states which helps to underscore the strength of the us dollar visàvis the euro
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Positive;0.8841003179550171;of course that is an influence with which we have to cope but  as i indicated in my introduction  we have the feeling that we are rapidly getting into step with the us economy and that could and it even should lead to a  let me call it  more balanced development of the exchange rate as well
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.891144335269928;question the rate rise was very moderate compared with your hawkish introduction
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.6299055218696594;so does it mean that you still think that there is a prominent tightening bias left or was this mostly a warning to labour markets
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9281343221664429;duisenberg well as for the future it is on the one hand a signal to the labour markets
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.5432754755020142;on the other hand it is also an assurance to the labour markets that we are here to maintain price stability
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8844012022018433;and that is our goal
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9491623044013977;that is what underlies our considerations for todays increase
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.925803542137146;the size of the increase  i do not know how you want to qualify it  but you should not see it as a bias in any direction you might think of
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.6241147518157959;question until now you have had a policy of making substantial interest rate rises but not too often and of signalling them well in advance to the markets
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9724422693252563;all of these things you have publicly stated as being your policy
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Negative;0.6917264461517334;by departing from that practice on this occasion are you not giving the impression that this rate rise and this action is a panic reaction to what has just happened
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Negative;0.8484815359115601;duisenberg well listening to the statements i made on behalf of the governing council a month ago and to the statements i made only a week ago i think that they do not in any way point to a panic reaction
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Negative;0.6122258901596069;at least that is not the feeling we have
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.6469139456748962;i believe we have prepared markets well enough in their as it so happens justified expectation that something would happen
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Negative;0.6915340423583984;and i do not think that todays decision will have come as a big surprise to any of you here
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9346451759338379;question could you tell us if there was any discussion today of making the increase a 05 percentage point increase
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9810872673988342;and also whether the vote was taken by consensus by unanimous consensus or whether there was a formal vote
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8935815691947937;duisenberg first there was no formal vote
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8979206085205078;again as i had hoped and as it was it was a consensus decision
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9786681532859802;of course we did discuss the size and the timing of the increase
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9588122367858887;there was no discussion of the direction
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9661465287208557;but of course we discussed the size and the timing
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9667138457298279;well with regard to the timing the outcome of the discussion  by consensus  was that it was to be today rather than later
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9665646553039551;and with regard to the size the outcome of the discussion  also by consensus  was that a ï½ percentage point ie
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9851763248443604;25 basis points was by far the preferable option
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8337618708610535;question to what extent was your decision coordinated  if at all  with the us federal reserve
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9617853164672852;and also as far as the euro goes is it the euro  or the development of the euro  that tipped the scales for the ecb in this decision
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.968397319316864;duisenberg it just so happens that the fomc meets once every six weeks
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9669874310493469;we meet once every two weeks
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9782339930534363;and the schedule is known in advance
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9268836975097656;so it is pure coincidence that the decision by the federal reserves fomc yesterday came one day before our decision
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.7683882117271423;i can assure you that there were many contacts in the weeks that have passed and that the development of the exchange rate was not a decisive move that tipped the scales
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9726428389549255;but of course as i indicated in my introductory remarks in our decision today we carefully looked at the recent developments in the exchange rate as one of the main indicators which could have a lasting effect on future price developments and which we wanted to counteract
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9151091575622559;question translation mr duisenberg you have referred to what you have said previously on your attitude in the past months
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8160457015037537;but clearly you were somewhat obscure no more or less than mr greenspan because  following the ecofin meeting in brussels  the ministers of finance thought that there was no risk to price stability and they thought there would be no increase in interest rates after that ecofin meeting
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9540442824363708;so clearly your communication did not get through to the 11 ministers of finance
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8151839375495911;and it does not seem to me that they got your message
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9157015085220337;duisenberg well even though i had hoped to relay this question on to mr noyer this time i have to answer it myself
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9590609669685364;may i refer you to the statement i made after the meeting in brussels last monday which admittedly i prepared rather carefully
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9831258654594421;it did give an indication that we did see increasing dangers to price stability and i can assure you that it was in the same way in the same words and the same message i gave one hour earlier to the ministers of finance
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8306154608726501;and they understood it perfectly well
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9672921299934387;question mr president according to all external accounts that i am aware of the whole of the european system of central banks is holding far more us dollar reserves than they would need for monetary policy purposes
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9364414811134338;now given that you are so firmly convinced that the us dollar should depreciate against the euro again can the public expect of its asset managers at the central banks that they will sell their assets when they are likely to depreciate
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8505346179008484;duisenberg the reserves that the eurosystem holds are a legacy of the past
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9593879580497742;we have them and we hold them as a responsible head of household
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9348652958869934;so you can assume nothing about efforts on our part to try to spend them
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8801891207695007;there is no need for it
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.7251026630401611;it would even be dangerous if we did that
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9553983807563782;question mr duisenberg i have not yet understood to what degree you base your decision on real economic data and monetary data and to what degree you look at the markets
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.6448860168457031;how important was what has happened on the financial markets for your decision
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8282668590545654;duisenberg i cannot quantify it precisely
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9802412986755371;we make an assessment of developments in all markets of the development of real economic data of all those data that belong to the broad range of indicators we look at alongside the purely monetary developments
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Positive;0.5964885950088501;and what we try to achieve  given that europe has entered into a phase of strong economic recovery which has even led us to the statement that we are now experiencing robust growth  is a period of prolonged noninflationary growth in the years to come
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Negative;0.6442126035690308;question mr duisenberg can we take it from this decision that you are feeling less confident now that the depreciation we see of the euro would in fact be a shortterm phenomenon
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8399771451950073;duisenberg no you cannot take this from that
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9776936769485474;i will be quite honest with you  of course we have our explanations with the benefits of hindsight about why the euro exchange rate is where it is
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Positive;0.9773938655853271;we did and we do believe that the euro has a strong upward potential for the reasons which i have given to you so often
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Negative;0.8155953884124756;i am no less confident now that that expectation will materialise at some point
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.7509545087814331;i do not know when
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.864603579044342;question mr duisenberg you underlined in your statement the importance of wage settlements twice
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9929475784301758;but in the great majority of european countries we already have very reasonable wage settlements and quite slow wage growth
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8018952012062073;why did you send this signal
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9750300645828247;duisenberg because i do not agree with your statement that we already have wage settlements in the great majority of the euro area countries
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9738361239433289;the process is still very much underway and we are not just looking at one country we are looking at 11 countries simultaneously
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9191443920135498;and with a view to this process our decision is on the one hand giving a warning to the social partners
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9789856672286987;on the other hand by our actions we are also giving assurance to the social partners that they can  so to speak  rely on the european central bank to deliver price stability over the medium term and that they should also take that into account in their wage negotiations
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9856297373771667;question mr duisenberg greece is expected officially to apply to join the euro area in early march
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Negative;0.5142456889152527;how do you judge the convergence process of greece so far and what do you say about the still very high interest rates
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9440183043479919;duisenberg i will not in any way make a judgement now which we have to make some time in april as  i think  is our timing
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9879095554351807;on the state of the convergence process of greece so far i must say we do expect  we have to expect  that convergence will continue in the course of this year so that interest rates in greece will be virtually in line with euro area interest rates at the time greece actually endeavours to enter
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9473729133605957;question mr duisenberg your goal is an inflation rate of below 2 the goal of the ecb
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Negative;0.7516351938247681;now you see price risks
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9820237755775452;can inflation will inflation rise above 2 in the next few months
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.832429051399231;what are your expectations and what are your expectations for the whole year
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.6865627765655518;duisenberg as higher oil prices are working their way through and as import prices are higher due to the exchange rate we do expect inflation in the coming months to continue to increase somewhat and to taper off a few months later so as to remain  on average  well below the maximum of 2 in the year as a whole and in the next year
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9771333932876587;and that time horizon is what we are looking at when we take monetary policy decisions today
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9522278904914856;question but there may be some months in which we could have more than 2 inflation
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8278061747550964;duisenberg well there are some countries where it is above 2
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Negative;0.765790581703186;and there are other countries where it is still far below that
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.5335234999656677;but looking at the whole of the euro area i doubt whether your prediction will come true
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8709230422973633;question mr duisenberg you said there is no bias left
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.7601977586746216;but your statement reads as if there is still a strong upward potential
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8955501317977905;can we expect another step very soon
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9804038405418396;duisenberg you can expect that we will act appropriately whenever the circumstances give rise to do so
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8166532516479492;questioni have two questions
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8920643925666809;the first one goes back to what you said about the benefit of hindsight and the reasons for the euros erosion
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Negative;0.7668728828430176;could it be partly political such as the diplomatic situation with austria within the eu or the financing scandal in germany
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8953444957733154;that is one question
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Negative;0.9555953741073608;the other question is do you have any concerns that the euro which fell more than most people expected could have an effect on public confidence
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.38492482900619507;thank you
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9753491282463074;duisenberg i am repeating myself but  with the benefit of hindsight  you can find many factors that explain the movements in the exchange rate
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8666442036628723;the main factor is still i believe the different cyclical situations in the euro area compared with the united states which make it quite normal for the exchange rate to move as it has
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9238277077674866;but then of course in modern financial markets political factors like those you have mentioned do not fail to have their impact on the exchange rates either
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Negative;0.7196248769760132;question and about the public confidence
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8817638158798218;can you say anything
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.5732967257499695;duisenberg we hope to underscore public confidence by our actions and by an appropriate policy to preserve the peoples confidence in their currency to the maximum extent possible
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.875690758228302;question mr duisenberg i am sorry i think you will not like my question
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.937541127204895;when you justified when the ecb justified the last two policy decisions each time you were proud to have been very clear in your step and to have taken the expectations out of the market and you said so
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9761469960212708;and this time you say we act whenever we think it is appropriate
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Negative;0.7459697127342224;to the outside what you did convey was a little of the impression of uncertainty of not really knowing
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8133255243301392;and certainly you did not do anything to take the expectations out of the markets
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8082631230354309;could you please comment on this
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9474691152572632;i mean there is a difference between the two first policy decisions and this one here
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.5408175587654114;certainly there will be expectations in the markets for higher rises now
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.7205314636230469;could you just comment on this
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9571020603179932;duisenberg well i believe that regarding our last move of 4 november last year we deliberately let me say massaged the markets in that direction between 15 july and 4 november
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9207406044006348;again with the benefit of hindsight we are now of the opinion that that period may have been on the long side
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8208531141281128;this time nobody can say that we did not give indications or warnings that something was going to happen to the public at large and the markets in particular
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9063984751701355;of course we cannot say precisely when it is going to happen and by how much
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9787346124649048;this is decided at the time of the decision at the last minute
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8842878937721252;but i cannot agree with your statement that this time we did not prepare the markets at all
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.6689178943634033;i think the opposite is true
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Positive;0.40015915036201477;if you listen carefully to or read the statement i made last monday the statements the vicepresident and some of my colleagues made in the weeks before that even the statement we delivered together a month ago then there were many signs that you could expect something
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9521996974945068;question translation to what extent have you moved your views on the publication of forecasts
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9764659404754639;you have not published any forecasts yet but you have said that you agree with the inflation forecasts of the european commission  15 for this year and next year  which has led to the fact that the ig metall for instance has referred to this 15 and has referred to your press conference
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.776847243309021;have you considered this further
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9683947563171387;and when are you actually going to make a public ecbforecast for inflation
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.6936269402503967;duisenberg i think in the second half of this year
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.8877251744270325;we are not discussing this in the governing council at the moment
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9852487444877625;we are actively preparing it inside the ecb with our staff preparing for what and how we shall publish forecasts
2000-02-03;2000;February;REPORT;Neutral;0.9500974416732788;but i can assure you they will come
