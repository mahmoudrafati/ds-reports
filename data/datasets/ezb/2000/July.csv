2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9671448469161987;overall the outlook for price stability will be affected by several factors which will need to be monitored carefully
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9777711033821106;first strong monetary growth and ample liquidity conditions call for continuous monitoring
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9876655340194702;in addition it will be important in the current phase of strengthening economic growth for wages to continue on average to grow at rates compatible with the objective of price stability
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9698002338409424;this together with structural reform in the labour market will be important to sustain the process of noninflationary growth and to reduce unemployment in the euro area

2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9856989979743958;finally i should like to stress that a procyclical loosening of the fiscal policy stance could also add to upward risks to price stability
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9827326536178589;in this respect when looking at the euro area as a whole on a consolidated basis current fiscal budget plans are not sufficiently ambitious in view of the favourable economic prospects
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8538966178894043;let me now give the floor to the vicepresident to say a few words about other issues discussed by the governing council
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.910660445690155;first i should like to address the euro banknoterelated issue concerning the determination of the number of banknotes to be printed before the launch date of 1 january 2002 the latest forecast shows that there will be a need to put 14 billion euro banknotes into circulation compared with last years estimate of 13 billion
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Negative;0.8259080648422241;the increase can be attributed to three main factors a higher than expected figure for national banknotes in circulation which forms the basis of estimates of the launch stocks a higher forecast for the use of lowdenomination banknotes and a somewhat slower than previously expected development in the use of electronic money
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9848337173461914;second the governing council also had an exchange of views on recent developments in the eu banking industry
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9869300127029419;the discussion was based on preparatory work by the banking supervision committee
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9152990579605103;the governing council is well aware that the current process of consolidation is no longer confined to small and mediumsized banks  as it was in the past  but that now it also covers the larger banks at the national level and crossborder mergers and alliances are on the increase
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.5608615875244141;the role of the euro as a factor encouraging this process of consolidation via further integration of money and capital markets is important
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Positive;0.5686644315719604;the consolidation process is welcome in general since it allows efficiency gains to be achieved in the banking sector
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9093955159187317;on the other hand it affects the competitive environment in which banks operate as well as their risk profile
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9675077795982361;therefore a careful monitoring on the part of the public authorities responsible for prudential supervision and financial stability is required
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9851495027542114;the governing council decided that a report on mergers and acquisitions involving the eu banking industry be prepared for publication in the autumn
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9318070411682129;we are now at your disposal should you have any questions
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9836592674255371;transcript of the questions asked and the answers given by dr willem f duisenberg president of the ecb and christian noyer vicepresident of the ecb question euroland has been on the verge of an upswing a couple of times in recent years once in 1994 and 1995 and the second time in 1998 at both times external shocks derailed the recoveries
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.6441582441329956;the first time it was the mexican crisis and higher us rates the second time it was the emerging market crisis
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9404885768890381;we now all appear to be  sort of  in that situation again
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9914970993995667;the external shock this time would come from a slowdown in the us economy
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Negative;0.703818678855896;what i would like to know is will the euroland recovery be derailed once again
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9687818884849548;can euroland growth survive a us slowdown or not
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9846998453140259;duisenbergall indications are indeed that developments in the united states are slowing down somewhat but i would certainly not qualify this as an external shock because all indications are that the us economy is in for what we had all hoped for namely a soft rather than a hard landing
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Negative;0.8503159880638123;so i would not call this an external shock and i think the euro area economy will be able to weather this storm or  as i would prefer to call it  this weak wind with ease
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9047131538391113;question mr president last monday you met the chancellor of austria
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.5948277711868286;did he mention his referendum project about the socalled eu sanctions against his country and are you afraid of the possible consequences of this referendum on the exchange rate of the euro in autumn
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.7503358125686646;and on your side do you think that the sanctions should be lifted
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8988293409347534;duisenberg he did not mention the referendum issue
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8802797198295593;so i can also forget about your second question
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.969543993473053;with regard to your third question as to whether the sanctions should be lifted i would like to emphasise that the european central bank is totally independent of political influence and that is not only a right but also an obligation
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8339369297027588;we too should not try to exert any political influence
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9787499308586121;that is what we give in return for being independent ourselves
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9710118174552917;so the issues you have raised do not in any way have an influence on our cooperation with the austrian national bank which is an integral part of the european system of central banks nor on that with its mother state so to speak
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8802915215492249;question mr duisenberg we are just ahead of the g8 finance ministers meeting in fukuoka
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9907788038253784;the bank of japan has started to prepare the markets for an end to its nearzero interest rate policy
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9049489498138428;do you regard the japanese economy as being stable enough already to conclude such a step and secondly i would like to know  assuming that japan lifts its policy  how would it affect the euro exchange rates
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9130228161811829;duisenberg first of all i would prefer to leave a judgement and an evaluation of the japanese economy to the relevant authorities and i would like to limit myself to commenting on the european economy
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9173296093940735;and the second question is a very hypothetical one on a change in the monetary policy stance in japan and well let me say that i never give answers to hypothetical questions
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Positive;0.5796063542366028;question mr president we have seen two variable rate tenders and we have gained first experience therewith
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.913227379322052;we have seen bidding up to 49
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9096852540969849;can you give us an idea of whether this bidding will rise further and whether the markets expect higher rates to accompany this bidding
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9603230357170105;will you still try to stay close to your 425 level or would you allow a stepwise upswing of the marginal lending facility
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.7963453531265259;duisenberg first of all we are extremely satisfied with our experience of the first two tenders of the variable rate type combined with the minimum bid which we allowed and announced
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Positive;0.7550695538520813;this experience has been very satisfactory
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9786540865898132;the reason for changing to this new system as you may know was the practice of everlower allotment rates which we had to accept which made the whole system assume grotesque features
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.6796323657035828;we believe  or rather can observe  that this phenomenon has disappeared and in the first two tenders where market expectations were not moving in any particular direction the effective rates and the marginal rates have stayed very close to the minimum bid rate
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.6615551710128784;we expect this to remain the case as long as market expectations do not change significantly and we see no reason why they should
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9277188181877136;question the french president the other day called for the appointment of what one might call an alternative mr euro to coordinate the economic policies of the euro 11 you have already said that you do not think such a figure is necessary and i would like to ask you how strong your opposition to such an appointment is
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Negative;0.6373881697654724;and second i would like to ask you where the exchange rate is concerned whether the euros recovery on the foreign exchange markets appears to have faltered or are you expecting to see the euro exchange rates recovering further in the coming months
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9716885685920715;duisenberg on the first issue of the appointment of another mr euro or an extra mr euro i am not in opposition to it nor am i in favour of it and i take note of what has been said
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9837592840194702;on the exchange rates i can only repeat that it is still our firm belief given economic developments in both europe on the one hand and the united states on the other that the euro has a strong potential to appreciate over time
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Negative;0.9868268966674805;and looking at the developments of the past few weeks or even months i would not go along with your statement that the recovery seems to have faltered
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9327408671379089;question mr president producer prices rose by 65 on an annualised basis in may
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Negative;0.8439342975616455;is this a serious problem or how immediate or how strong is the impact of producer prices in the euro area
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9574341177940369;duisenberg well it is one of the indicators which we carefully watch in the context of the second pillar of our monetary policy strategy but only one
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9795715808868408;and the precise relationship between increases in producer prices and their translation ultimately into consumer prices is a rather loose one
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9562729597091675;so it being only one of a wide range a broad range of indicators and the relationship being a loose one i cannot give a precise answer to the question as to what precisely the impact will be in the future
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8998805284500122;it is one of the things we look at
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Negative;0.6225312352180481;and it is one of the reasons why we still think that the risks to price stability are on the upside rather than on the downside
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9811806678771973;question translation mr president yesterday in strasbourg speaking at the european parliament you said that the promised forecasts would become available towards the end of this year
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9819040894508362;that is also going to be the time probably when the governing council establishes the reference value
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9593608379364014;are you going to combine those decisions
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9679057598114014;because at that time you will have to decide whether you will stick to your rate of less than 2 as meaning that we continue not to have inflation
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8505256772041321;what are your plans please
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9826474785804749;duisenberg we will review as we have announced our reference value for monetary growth in december which we do once a year
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.980004608631134;one thing is almost as certain namely that we will publish forecasts probably towards the end of the year
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.984524667263031;of course these forecasts will then be one of the inputs but only one used in coming to a judgement on what the reference value will be
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9685880541801453;however if i already knew the forecasts now i could just as well publish them now
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9655080437660217;but i do not know them yet so i can do no more than answer your question in these vague terms and certainly not in quantitatively precise terms
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9348485469818115;question it is reported that mr welteke kind of implied that until september there would not be any change in policy and you mentioned earlier that the ecb has cleared a horizon or something like that
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9404181838035583;i am just wondering what we should do with this  i mean my wife would like to go out of germany and would like to take a vacation
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Negative;0.606855034828186;so i wonder when would be a good time
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8855780363082886;duisenberg i recommend august
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8869276642799377;because that is when i take my vacation
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.7627815008163452;question president duisenberg one followup question with respect to the forecast
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9503623247146606;have you already decided on whose behalf or who will be responsible for the forecast
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9906398057937622;will it be the ecb staff will it be the executive board or will it be the governing council
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8438637256622314;and a different question you have talked about banking supervision and i am sure you are aware of the discussions about the restructuring of the deutsche bundesbank
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.98680579662323;from your point of view how important is it for central banks to be part of or responsible for banking supervision
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9691174626350403;duisenberg the precise responsibility for the forecasts
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9714372158050537;we are preparing that
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9454048871994019;a decision has not been taken yet
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9176561832427979;the complication as you very well know is the following
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9862920045852661;many institutions publish forecasts but not many institutions which publish forecasts are at the same time responsible for policies
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.920690655708313;and we have to make it understood by the public and by everybody also by you that forecasts have great benefits but that they also have limitations
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9589807391166687;they normally become outdated very quickly
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.981624186038971;they are based on certain hypotheses regarding socalled exogenous variables or exogenous factors
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.991124153137207;and they are only one of the inputs for the subsequent taking of monetary policy decisions
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8962860107421875;so we have to be very careful in explaining that
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8993940949440002;and as to who will take responsibility for them  we are still discussing this
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9822723865509033;we certainly do not want at least i do not want to make the governing council as such responsible for the forecast and therefore also accountable for the forecast
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9911057353019714;because the governing council has in making monetary policy decisions to take many many more factors into account than only a forecast which will be produced as a combined effort by ecb staff and staff of the national central banks
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9647539258003235;so in a way to put it fairly honestly we would like to keep our hands free and we have to explain why
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9193490743637085;i think that this explanation has to be very extensive and very well understood
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9107117652893066;as for banking supervision  as you know the ecb as such has only a very limited mandate in the area of banking supervision
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9869772791862488;it is our view that a close connection between banking supervision and central banking is of the essence both for supervisors and for the central banks
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9248932600021362;so that is a close connection
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9764553904533386;i am not saying that it always has to be done by central banks
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9642500281333923;but the very close connection as i have said is regarded as very important for both policies for supervisory policy and for monetary policy
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8517940044403076;question have any of the new economic data that have come out since the last press conference since you last raised interest rates surprised you in any way
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.7631763219833374;or have things gone pretty much the way you would have expected
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9414342045783997;duisenberg matters have developed pretty much the way we expected them to
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Positive;0.9913253784179688;and all the data we have received have confirmed or strengthened our view that europe is well under way in and into a period of robust economic growth with inflation  although close to the edge  being kept under control
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9613004922866821;but all the data that have come out also confirm our assessment that the risks are on the upside rather than on the downside
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8193061947822571;question would we journalists be right if we left the room today and said that the horizon is still clear for a little while
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8345639705657959;would you be happy with that
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8105890154838562;duisenberg yes if i look outside it is beautiful
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.855817973613739;question but seriously though
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8531737923622131;is that the message you would like to get out today
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9407056570053101;duisenberg yes but there is no other message than that which i have just given
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9855369925498962;we believe that our decision of 8 june 2000 to raise interest rates was and still is appropriate in the light of the circumstances and the economic developments as we see them and as we evaluate them
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Negative;0.8630203604698181;question translation president duisenberg introducing a new currency is a great challenge
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Negative;0.4993404448032379;therefore a halfsporting halfmonetary question  you know that the dutch have lost against the italians in particular
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.6869617700576782;what should one do in order not to lose such important matches in europe
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Negative;0.8983688354492188;duisenberg on this question because i was there when the penalty kicks were taken i must confess that i am still angry
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8324078321456909;and it is better not to comment in an emotional state
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.7567639946937561;question mr duisenberg there is a lot of discussion about centralising banking supervision at the european level that there is a need for that
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9708404541015625;what would you prefer an independent authority for coordinating banking supervision at the european level or a strengthening of the supervisory committee that already exists
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.7239610552787781;what is your vision on this
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9726301431655884;duisenberg we prefer as i said earlier central banks to be closely involved in the process of banking supervision
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9688374400138855;closely involved means closely connected to or associated with  question  that is not very precise
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8772732615470886;duisenberg oh that is very precise
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9808822274208069;there are various models available to achieve this
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9761543869972229;in a number of countries it is the national central bank which is responsible for banking supervision
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.8447432518005371;question i know i am not talking about the national level
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9435672163963318;i am talking about the european level
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.755159318447113;duisenberg we have no interest in doing that
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.7865180373191833;we are perfectly happy with leaving actual supervision in national hands
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9755800366401672;and the ecb or the eurosystem is not part of a movement to europeanise or centralise banking supervision or other ways of supervision
2000-07-06;2000;July;REPORT;Neutral;0.9741247296333313;what we are doing at the european level is to contribute to a close coordination of the supervisory regimes in the various member states and to contribute to making the playing field level
