2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.984363853931427;the governing council today conducted its regular examination of the outlook for price developments and the risks to price stability in the euro area
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9912362098693848;following this review the governing council decided to maintain the interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the eurosystem at 35 and to keep the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and on the deposit facility at 45 and 25 respectively
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9340673685073853;allow me to give you an overview of the main elements of our assessment of the latest information on monetary financial market and other economic developments
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9732832908630371;let me start with information in relation to the first pillar of our monetary policy strategy
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9583526253700256;no new monetary data have been released since the last meeting of the governing council which was held in madrid on 30 march 2000 the annual growth rate of m3 in february 2000 was 62
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9418158531188965;this implied a small increase in the threemonth moving average of annual m3 growth to 59 from 58 recorded for the threemonth period from november 1999 to january 2000 m3 growth thus remained around 1 12 percentage points above the reference value of 4 12
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9914785027503967;the picture of generous liquidity conditions in the euro area is also confirmed by the continued strong annual rate of growth of loans to the private sector which stood at 105 in february
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9901121258735657;with regard to economic developments in the euro area following strong growth of real gdp in the second half of 1999 most recent production and survey data suggest that the economic expansion also remained strong in early 2000 in particular both consumer and industrial confidence have now reached levels which are close to the highest observed since the mid1980s
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9882357120513916;this picture of strong growth of domestic demand supports the favourable outlook for economic growth in the euro area as depicted in recent forecasts
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9928261041641235;the positive prospects for euro area activity also benefit from the strong cyclical upswing in the world economy which has become more broadly based across industrial and emerging economies and which is expected to continue in the years to come
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9533058404922485;the exchange rate of the euro does not reflect the ongoing improvement in domestic fundamentals in the euro area economy
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Negative;0.7602770924568176;in nominal effective terms the euro was around 4 lower in midapril than at the beginning of the year and approximately 14 below its level in the first quarter of last year
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9196828007698059;until reversed this development will put upward pressure on import prices and will continue to affect the risks for price stability in the euro area
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8414332866668701;as i have already noted on previous occasions the rise in the harmonised index of consumer prices hicp which we have observed over recent months stems to a large extent from the combined effects of both oil price and exchange rate developments
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9883240461349487;the annual rate of change in the hicp rose to 20 in february 2000 from 19 in the previous month
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8217382431030273;the rate of inflation on producer prices also rose further in february 2000 mainly in connection with rising prices for intermediate goods
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9923075437545776;in the course of the past few weeks oil prices have declined
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9823868274688721;this has been in line with the assumption underlying currently available economic forecasts namely that the oil price increases which we observed until march will partially unwind in the course of the year
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9633974432945251;at the same time it is most likely that the complete upward impact on consumer prices via import and producer prices of the oil price and exchange rate developments in recent months has not yet materialised
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8559150695800781;against this background the possibility cannot be ruled out that the figure for annual hicp inflation will slightly exceed 2 in the spring of this year before falling back to lower levels
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8708537220954895;what matters for monetary policy however are the trends underlying the outlook for price stability in the medium term
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Negative;0.763902485370636;in this context the governing council again stressed the need for the continuation of wage moderation in the euro area
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9631288647651672;as noted earlier monetary and credit developments confirm that liquidity in the euro area is ample
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Negative;0.993845522403717;developments in the exchange rate of the euro also remain a cause for concern with regard to future price stability
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9758448004722595;in the light of the favourable prospects for strong economic growth the impact of these developments on inflationary pressures will need to be monitored closely
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9865125417709351;the eurosystem will remain vigilant in assessing upside risks to price stability and will take appropriate action if and when required
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8006734848022461;a forwardlooking monetary policy which responds to risks to price stability before they materialise will avoid the need for a costly stabilisation of inflation at a later stage
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Positive;0.6797606348991394;such a forwardlooking approach is clearly also the best contribution monetary policy can make to ensuring the sustainability of the process of economic growth
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9887363314628601;this phase of economic growth in the euro area will offer a great opportunity to make further progress in bringing down the high level of unemployment in the euro area
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Positive;0.8589780926704407;an important means of achieving this will be continued wage moderation which in turn will also help to contain inflationary pressure
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Positive;0.987351655960083;this notwithstanding as i have stressed repeatedly in the past the key to achieving a sustainable reduction in the level of unemployment will be structural reforms in the euro area including a lowering of the tax burden and an improvement in the fiscal expenditure structure
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9076047539710999;only when labour markets are more flexible and competitive pressures are high will it be possible to prevent bottlenecks from triggering upward pressures on prices at a relatively early stage of an economic recovery
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9696011543273926;fiscal policy has to play its part in this context
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Negative;0.8051196336746216;the favourable economic prospects will lead to higher tax revenues
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Negative;0.7447543144226074;in line with the stability and growth pact it is not opportune to use these extra revenues for higher spending
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.866041898727417;now is the time to speed up fiscal consolidation in order to help to reduce further the debttogdp ratios in the community and to approach more quickly fiscal budgetary positions in surplus or balance
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9686721563339233;let me now give the floor to the vicepresident to present some of the additional topics discussed today by the governing council
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9537251591682434;i should like to draw your attention to two items the first reflects the eurosystems growing involvement in the eu accession process and relates to the governing councils position with regard to the appropriateness of eurobased currency board arrangements cbas as a strategy to be used by accession countries with regard to adopting the euro the second relates to a further enhancement of the ecbs transparency policy
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9542311429977417;let me start with the governing councils deliberations on cbas
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9859787821769714;we concluded that the appropriateness of cbas will be assessed on a casebycase basis
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9583565592765808;therefore the governing council neither encourages nor discourages the adoption of eurobased cbas
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9766317009925842;in any event such arrangements cannot be regarded as a substitute for two years participation in erm ii
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9622394442558289;accession countries which have operated a eurobased cba deemed to be sustainable might not be required to go through a double regime shift in their strategies to adopt the euro
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9901694655418396;thus such countries may participate in erm ii with a cba as a unilateral commitment augmenting the discipline within erm ii
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9892260432243347;however it should be clearly understood that a common accord would have to be reached on the central parity against the euro
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9888797998428345;with a view to further enhancing the ecbs transparency policy the governing council has today decided to publish all nonconfidential legal instruments governing the relationship between the ecb and the euro area national central banks in the official journal of the european communities
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9028457403182983;the release of these legal instruments in all 11 official community languages will give interested members of the public an opportunity to gain firsthand knowledge about the internal operation of the eurosystem
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.5560868382453918;the members of the governing council regard the transparency of the decisionmaking process as an appropriate means by which to strengthen the democratic nature of the institution and to increase the publics confidence in its administration
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9788763523101807;this decision is in line with the general policy towards increased transparency in the decisionmaking process currently being pursued at the community level
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9318070411682129;we are now at your disposal should you have any questions
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.916706919670105;transcript of the questions asked and the answers given by dr willem f duisenberg president of the ecb and christian noyer vicepresident of the ecb question how do you interpret the recent wage settlements
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9123746752738953;are they on average better or worse than what you had expected and are you worried about divergence in the euro area
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.831477701663971;duisenberg let me answer the last question first
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Negative;0.7751693725585938;we are generally speaking not worried about divergencies within the euro area
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9256910085678101;they are normal and natural
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.7006783485412598;the wage negotiations are still going on in full force
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9873079657554626;we have only incidental or anecdotal information on the outcome of wage negotiations in the various parts of the european union
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8244341611862183;and they sometimes diverge
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9754573106765747;there are some encouraging signs particularly here in germany
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9934631586074829;there are also signs which give more cause for concern in other areas of the european economy
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9376250505447388;so the process is still going on but  as i said in my introductory statement  we cannot stop emphasising the high importance of moderate wage settlements in the interests of the allencompassing fight against unemployment
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.7615536451339722;question mr vicepresident
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.6890619397163391;you have mentioned the eu enlargement process
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9540282487869263;have you also discussed any institutional changes that might be required with respect to the decisionmaking bodies of the ecb
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9689096808433533;for example could you imagine a governing council consisting of about 30 members
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8931564092636108;noyer well the answer is no we have not discussed that
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9595947265625;but perhaps the president would like to add something
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9589662551879883;duisenberg we have not discussed it today but we have discussed it many times before
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9312102198600769;and we do not see the need for institutional changes in the organisation of the european system of central banks including the ecb
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.5046825408935547;question obviously there is a feeling in some central banks as we could read in the press in the netherlands for instance that the cooperation between eastern europe and lets say the euro area is going at too high a speed
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.67267906665802;on the other hand it is clear that some other countries would not be able to wait until lets say 2007 and 2006 to get into the euro area
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9682406783103943;so what exactly has been discussed in this respect  the speed of lets say coming into the euro orbit
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9441171288490295;is there any thought of lets say changing the legislation in connection with article 109 so that nonmember countries too could join erm ii
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9217798709869385;and if i may a second short question duisenberg if you would allow me to answer the first one first
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9533904790878296;i happen by chance to have read what was published in the dutch newspapers
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9834797382354736;i would like to emphasise that in the process of accession you have to clearly distinguish between i would say three phases
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9550419449806213;first there is the accession to the european union
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9893004298210144;second sometimes years later there will be the required entry into the european exchange rate mechanism
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9123243689537048;and third again years later there will be the possibility  provided all the convergence criteria both quantitative and qualitative have been met  of entry into monetary union and also of adopting the euro as their currency
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9852277040481567;so all in all we are talking about a process  i do not want to give the idea that we have a precise figure in mind  but we are talking about a process which to my mind will take at least a decade to be fully completed
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9093934297561646;question  maybe just a short question do you realise that a lot of citizens in central europe hold large amounts of deutsche mark which  because they are not certain of what is going to happen in 2002 and for how long they could exchange them into euro  they are now changing into us dollars
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9398305416107178;and this is a rather duisenberg well i do not have figures on that but let me give some consolation or some confidence to those outside the euro area who hold private reserves in deutsche mark
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9847871661186218;the fact is that about 30 of the deutsche mark in circulation is supposed to be circulating outside germany
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9659879207611084;of that 30 most is circulating in central and eastern europe
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.7667068839073181;they will have to be swapped for euro banknotes as from 1 january 2002 they will not lose their value for a long time after that
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9854618310928345;there will be a long period after that in which they can still be exchanged for euro banknotes but only at the central bank and no longer in the private sector
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9832049012184143;so the exchange with banks in the private sector will be possible for a period of approximately one to two months
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9743157029151917;those who are still sitting on german banknotes after that will have to go to the central bank if they want to get rid of them and change them
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9656587243080139;and this may take a period  well it differs from country to country  of say up to 30 years
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9757438898086548;question mr president a few days ago the american vicepresident and maybe the next president of the united states said that the euro is not going to be any threat for the role of the us dollar until the euro countries have separate fiscal policies until there is no single fiscal policy in europe
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9119212627410889;do you agree with this statement
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8962458968162537;duisenberg well i have not read the statement so i cannot say that i have understood it
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9593251943588257;but because it was the vicepresident who said it i will ask the vicepresident to answer
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8745718598365784;noyer i have not read it either but  as you report it to us  i can hardly understand it
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.875436007976532;i think this is a completely different topic
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.7071837782859802;i cannot understand the relationship you mention
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.5280050039291382;duisenberg i could not agree more
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Negative;0.8074409365653992;question mr president with regard to the article 4 report that came from the imf or that  at least  was published last week the majority of the directors on the global board see no danger of inflation
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Negative;0.8974947333335876;they see very loose output labour markets in the euro area
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Negative;0.5749955773353577;and therefore they think there is no real reason at the moment for a tightening of policy and that you should allow output to grow perhaps not least with a view to the unemployment problem
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.6942718625068665;i wonder if that has had an influence on your decision today
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8776005506515503;your rhetoric certainly does not reflect the absence if you like of concern about inflation at the present time
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.5994588732719421;duisenberg no it is true and if i may take this opportunity what you are referring to is the recently published world economic outlook of the imf in which it was said  as far as monetary policy in europe is concerned  that admittedly monetary conditions were ample but  given the economic situation and the likely development of inflation  there seemed to be no need to tighten monetary policy
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.934390127658844;let me simply say that we the governing council do not agree with that assessment
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8175861239433289;question and nonetheless you did not tighten it today
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Negative;0.8324498534202576;perhaps there is some suspicion you might have been influenced
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9142536520957947;duisenberg well if that suspicion is there it is unfounded
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.6390677094459534;question two questions
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8953622579574585;what will your message on the euro be at the g7 table this weekend and what do you think about the eu forecasts that were released this week
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9509017467498779;are they in line with yours
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9777993559837341;duisenberg at the g7 table the euro will undoubtedly be one of the topics for discussion and so will the yen and the us dollar
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8054705262184143;what i am going to say there is that indeed as i have just said in my introductory statement the continuous  let me call it  depressed level of the euro exchange rate puzzles us
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8082523345947266;it will have an impact if it perseveres but we are not sure that it will and we do not expect it to persevere
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9913355708122253;if it perseveres it will have an impact on inflationary developments in the euro area and in that way it will be one of the factors we will be taking into account in future monetary policy decisions
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9532607793807983;as far as the forecasts that have recently been published by the european commission are concerned our analysis has led us to the conclusion that  in general terms  we concur with the contents of the forecasts
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.58802729845047;we are not entirely sure which hypotheses underlie these forecasts
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9194476008415222;let me put it this way we share the optimism on economic growth as it has been expressed by the commission in that we also believe that growth in 2000 and 2001 will be well in excess of 3
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9762954711914062;whether the high figures that the commission quotes will materialise gives us some reason for hesitation or doubt
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9787918329238892;as far as the inflation forecasts are concerned however where the commission expects inflation to average out at 18 in 2000 and 2001 we have  as i have just said in my introductory statement  now reached a level of 2
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Negative;0.8508120775222778;we will not be surprised  on the contrary to the extent that oil price and exchange rate developments work their way through in the coming months we do expect for a brief period in the coming months that the figure might even slightly exceed that of 2 before dropping back to 2 or less so that on average we are somewhat less comfortable than the commission seems to feel
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9406808614730835;question  so more than 18
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9765134453773499;duisenberg i will not put it in precise figures but we regard both the growth forecasts and the inflation forecast of the commission as being on the optimistic side from an economic point of view
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9258614778518677;the difference is not very large but  let me leave it at that judgement
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Negative;0.8458377718925476;question by optimistic you mean a little bit too high on the growth side and maybe a little bit too low on the inflation side
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8272042274475098;duisenberg that is correct
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9683544635772705;question mr president against the background of the remarks you have just made on inflation and against the background that you repeated the statement today that we can also find in your annual report  namely that the ecb acts with a forwardlooking perspective before inflation takes off in order to avoid larger and sharper rate hikes later  against that background would not today have been the right time to move
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.6540183424949646;duisenberg well apparently it was not
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.7267835140228271;question why not
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9705143570899963;duisenberg for that  in our assessment  you also have to remember that it was only four weeks ago that we raised interest rates by one quarter of a percent
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9271714687347412;and that was only four weeks after we had raised interest rates in february
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8072966933250427;to do so now would not create the impression of a very calm stable and forwardlooking policy
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8021456599235535;on the other hand all the indications we have given  and i will repeat them again today  are such that i believe that there cannot be any doubt in anybodys mind as to the direction in which the next move will go
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.5571503043174744;question mr duisenberg you have just made clear again that there is no doubt about the direction of the policy
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9858694076538086;so it can be assumed from todays discussions that it was really only about timing and presentation rather than about substance or direction of the policy
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9450278878211975;may i also ask  duisenberg but timing is important
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8121680021286011;direction is of course important
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.7027053833007812;magnitude is important
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9629155397415161;question  so you discussed timing today
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.849615216255188;duisenberg we discussed everything but we did not come to a decision
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9883715510368347;question mr president in the annual report of the ecb the depreciation of the euro against the us dollar was attributed largely to the better than expected performance of the us economy and to differentials in the cyclical outlook for the united states and the euro area
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9560021162033081;now it appears from a whole range of forecasts including those of the imf and the commission that the united states will once again outperform the euro area economy in terms of growth this year
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9325602650642395;does this mean in your view that there remains a fairly large obstacle in the path of the euro going upwards because of this continued superior performance of the us economy
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9779573082923889;duisenberg all forecasts that i am aware of indicate that in the course of this twoyear period and most likely towards the end of this year or early next year  which is later than expected earlier i admit  the euro area growth performance will overtake this still remarkably good growth performance of the united states
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9634202718734741;so that is linked to the timing of the reversal of exchange rate movements which we expect to happen with virtual certainty
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.902834951877594;but i am not a prophet and i cannot predict precisely when
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8966639637947083;if i could i would not tell you
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9148368835449219;if i knew i would be rich
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8710712790489197;question governor i would like to have your judgement on the japanese economy today again
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8636936545372009;the latest comment from boj governor hayami shocked the market yesterday by mentioning the future monetary policy change in this year
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.7320888042449951;but on the other hand the imf and the united states are clearly and strongly claiming that japan should retain the superlow interest rate
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.7793055176734924;how do you judge the japanese economy and what is your opinion about it
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9270706176757812;duisenberg it is a small question which would require a big answer  which i am not in a position to give
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9762136936187744;but there are encouraging signs of a recovery of the japanese economy finally taking hold after so many years of hesitation
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Positive;0.9870713353157043;the signs are encouraging
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9469252228736877;and the words of governor hayami as i know them and he will undoubtedly repeat them the day after tomorrow at the g7 meeting i can fully understand and support
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.7340673804283142;question i want to go back to the structural reforms
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9673994779586792;it is obvious that it has been discussed between the german and french governments the other day  the need to discuss with an enlarged emu that not all countries can participate in the governing council
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9336135983467102;would you think that it is inappropriate to have such a discussion on the emu structure or is it so to speak already prepared for the enlargement
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9665580987930298;and the second question is in your annual report you repeat this we must use the upward trend now to have more structural reforms
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9575957655906677;and you repeat this at nearly every press conference
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Negative;0.4868021607398987;but do you really see signs that there are real structural reforms going on
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8958892822265625;duisenberg first on the structure of the organisation and the institutional process i am not aware of what was discussed because i was not there
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8928127884864807;i do not know whether and if the french and german governments have discussed this matter
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9738574028015137;all i can say is that the governing council of the ecb in the context of the intergovernmental conference which is currently in progress and which has to be concluded by the end of this year sees no need to change the decisionmaking structures of the various bodies of the european system of central banks
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9667125940322876;so we will not take any initiative to that effect
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Negative;0.5438805222511292;and i doubt whether anybody else would take an initiative to that effect
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.6444175243377686;well the second part of your question was on structural reforms
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Negative;0.5009983777999878;we do see signs of structural reforms in various parts of economic and monetary union
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9665179252624512;but then one has to remember that the structural reforms necessary in the labour markets in the product markets in the goods and services markets in government finance in social security systems may  and do  differ from country to country and from region to region
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8931689262390137;so it is not easy it is even impossible to make a general statement about how these structural reforms are proceeding but our constant and consistent hammering on the need for structural reforms the need for greater flexibility in the markets in particular the labour markets will continue  from press conference to press conference and from monthly bulletin to monthly bulletin
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.951184868812561;and i did so again today because it is so necessary
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.5411247611045837;but this should not create the impression that nothing is happening anywhere
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9868386387825012;many things are happening but sometimes at a very slow and  occasionally  at an even disappointingly slow pace
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9342451691627502;question mr president in your introductory statement you said that the euro currently does not reflect the fundamentals and that if that were not to be rectified it would cause a problem
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Negative;0.6190240383148193;does that imply that you would be willing to act with interest hikes solely on the basis of a weak euro
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9439470171928406;duisenberg it does not imply that
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9106159806251526;i can repeat it again the position the level of the euro as it has now been for a rather prolonged period is a position which  over time  contributes to the upward risks to price stability
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9545672535896301;and it is that factor  if those upward risks become stronger or if they do not abate  that would induce monetary policy reactions not the exchange rate as such
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9681017994880676;the exchange rate as such is not our target
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8908177614212036;question so a sequence of higher import prices would be such a case
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Negative;0.9390448927879333;duisenberg well they contribute to the upward risks to price stability together with the prolonged period of high oil prices
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8876602649688721;and it is all these factors together with a few others which will ultimately lead to a conclusion
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9693869948387146;question mr president last year you promised a couple of times that the ecb will publish forecasts this year
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8538357019424438;are you going to do this already this spring
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8776004314422607;and second what kind of forecast will we see
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9791104197502136;will it be a broad and detailed analysis or just some dull figures or numbers or scenarios
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.8763526678085327;duisenberg i promised it this year
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9324410557746887;so i will not bring it forward to the spring
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.5769607424736023;and i hope to keep my promise that it will be this year
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9285873174667358;as to the precise form we are still considering it
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9678020477294922;it is very important  the form and the degree of detail it will include
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9796488881111145;and whenever we come to the publication of forecasts we do want to supplement it with you might say an educational explanation of what forecasts mean and what they can be used for making clear that they are certainly not the only determinant underlying certain decisions to be taken
2000-04-13;2000;April;REPORT;Neutral;0.9804022312164307;we therefore want to apply the laws of relativity also to the publishing of forecasts
