2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.986096203327179;let me first report that the governing council decided to reconfirm the existing reference value for monetary growth namely an annual growth rate of 4 12 for the broad aggregate m3
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Negative;0.805203914642334;this decision was taken on the grounds that the available evidence continues to support the assumptions underlying the initial derivation of the reference value in december 1998 and its confirmation in december 1999 namely those for trend potential output growth and the trend decline in m3 income velocity in the euro area
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.5546282529830933;with regard to the assessment of trend potential output growth there is still no decisive evidence that measurable and lasting increases in productivity growth in the euro area would warrant a significant upward revision in the assumption for trend potential growth
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Negative;0.5165539383888245;this notwithstanding the uncertainties surrounding estimates of the mediumterm development of potential output growth in the euro area have become skewed to the upside
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9862491488456726;against this background the governing council will carefully monitor further evidence with regard to an acceleration of productivity growth in the euro area
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9640504717826843;the governing council also wishes to emphasise that potential output growth could be strengthened by further structural reforms in the labour and goods markets
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9895660877227783;naturally the ecbs monetary policy will take such changes appropriately into account

2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Negative;0.8512936234474182;starting with the first pillar it is fair to say that m3 growth rates have shown signs of moderation over the past few months
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Negative;0.8629682660102844;however taking into account the protracted upward deviation of m3 growth from the reference value of 4 12 and the still robust growth of credit to the private sector caution continues to be warranted with regard to the upside risks to price stability stemming from the monetary side
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Negative;0.9721086025238037;as for key indicators related to the second pillar the assessment is currently complicated by increased uncertainty

2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.7064869403839111;what do you think
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9416131973266602;will this have as an impact on euroland
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9169303774833679;and the next question is how do you feel about the exchange rate of the euro
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.6307234764099121;are you happy with the way things have gone
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.7874791026115417;duisenberg usually i think that a central banker should not comment on speeches of other central bankers so i will refrain from commenting on the speech presented by my colleague greenspan last week
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9373319149017334;the development of the exchange rate of the euro is  i must say  completely in line with what we have said and expressed all along as our opinion namely that the euro had a strong potential to appreciate from the levels it had reached in earlier months so that has not been a surprise but rather an expectation that has come true
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.928712010383606;question translation a followup on that mr president could you tell us the extent to which alan greenspans statement has indirectly had a soothing effect on euroland
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9354344010353088;duisenberg it was not discussed in the governing council so i that have nothing to report in this respect
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9605627655982971;but i think that the speech made by mr greenspan has itself contributed to the tendency of the euro exchange rate to appreciate which had already set in some time earlier
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Positive;0.6808188557624817;so in that way it has had a positive impact
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.8599955439567566;question translation two questions if i may my colleague introduced the question
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9701265692710876;the first question mr president is that i would like to have your view of the results of the european council in nice
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9085044860839844;do you think that the results of the european council in nice which are not great will have an effect on the euro exchange rate
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.8059199452400208;and the second question as we are now coming up to the second anniversary of the single currency how do you feel about the year that the euro has experienced
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.8542060852050781;has it been a good year or has it been an annus horibilis for the euro
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.745116651058197;duisenberg first of all if the european council meeting in nice were to affect the exchange rate it would already have had that effect because exchange rates happen to react very quickly to events be they political or economic in nature and  as you will have seen  the euro exchange rate has hardly been touched by the outcome of the european council meeting which  i think  is a good thing in itself
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9798810482025146;if i reflect on the past year i am always inclined to reflect on the period since the birth of the euro ie
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9390231966972351;a period of almost two years
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.7693030834197998;on that basis i am filled with a feeling of satisfaction in many areas namely the smooth introduction of the euro the rapid development of a single money market in the euro area the rapid developments  which are still going on  in the capital markets in the euro area and i could go on and on with phenomena like that
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Negative;0.9170587658882141;i will not deny that in the past i have been somewhat dissatisfied or  how should i say that in english  disappointed with the actual development of the exchange rate of the euro
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Negative;0.9893882274627686;that feeling of dissatisfaction has disappeared now that the euro seems to have turned the corner
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9219750761985779;question mr president although you said that you are not very fond of commenting on other central bankers i will cite sir edward george governor of the bank of england who welcomed the slowdown in the united states a few days ago
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Negative;0.9926097989082336;he said that the fears of a hard landing were exaggerated
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.8332660794258118;do you share his opinion and how do you see the global economy the situation in japan and so on
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9491190910339355;duisenberg well i can only report on what the governing council discussed today
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Negative;0.966892659664154;this of course also included the risks of a hard landing and the outlook for the world economy as a whole
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9136661291122437;and as i had said in my introductory statement all available evidence is pointing towards the fact that a period of robust economic growth be it at a somewhat slower pace than we have seen in recent months still lies ahead of us in what we regard as the foreseeable future
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9711127877235413;we therefore anticipate that a growth rate in the order of 3 per year will be maintained in the euro area for at least the next two years
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Negative;0.9752189517021179;question in june you said that the us slowdown would be a weak wind that you could easily withstand
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Negative;0.9043750762939453;is there any reason to believe that europe would not be able to withstand that slowdown as well today as it would have in june
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Negative;0.6946271657943726;and the other question i have is how serious are these upside risks to price stability
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.8535912036895752;i am asking this because in the last few weeks a lot of banks have been scaling down their interest rate increase projections and now think that rates will remain on hold for some time and that the next move will be a cut
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Negative;0.96778404712677;are the markets a little bit premature
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.8598001003265381;duisenberg well on your first question i cannot see any reason to change that judgement
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Negative;0.920690655708313;on the second question i cannot quantify how serious the upside risks are but there are always risks to price stability  in one direction or another
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.83659428358078;the main thing i said was that the risks as we see them are on the upside rather than on the downside but i cannot quantify the degree
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9676806926727295;question mr president greece will be a member of monetary union in now two weeks time
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Negative;0.655805766582489;two questions on that obviously greece does have a tendency to inflation
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.5765870809555054;how much work do you think does greece have to make sure that inflation remains under control
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.8873801827430725;and the other aspect is of course that this is the first big expansion the first expansion of the single currency area since its birth
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9289050698280334;how you see that in historic terms greeces membership
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.6461055278778076;duisenberg could you expand a little on your second question
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.8912066221237183;question i mean that this is obviously a historic moment
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.6668044924736023;it is the first time that the single currency area has expanded since its birth
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.7668238282203674;in historic terms how do you see this greek entry
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.8928241729736328;duisenberg to answer the last question first
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9624215960502625;it is indeed a historic and a both very satisfying and gratifying moment for a member of the european union to be able to comply with all the criteria relating to entry to the euro area to participation in monetary union
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Positive;0.8794435858726501;and i think we have to say that greece has made great and commendable efforts in order to reach this stage
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Positive;0.8838808536529541;it shows the extent to which entry into monetary union and therefore complying with the maastricht criteria have acted and are still acting as a catalyst for moves towards more sound public finance policies an environment of low inflation and appropriate monetary policies
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Positive;0.8926109671592712;so that is all gratifying and sound
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.863784909248352;as to your first question  question  how much work now do you think greece has to undertake to make sure that it keeps inflation under control because it has had a tendency towards inflation in the past
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Negative;0.5289241075515747;duisenberg it still has a lot of further work to do
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.8941929936408997;but i would also like to mention that greece is going through a period which we all having to go through  a period in which oil price increases are working their way through in the domestic economy
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.5149464011192322;and in the case of greece the oil dependency or energy dependency of the economy is significantly higher than in other areas or in the rest of the euro area
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Positive;0.8456953763961792;so it still has to undertake great efforts to make the position it had reached upon entry a sustainable one
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9536036252975464;question talking about inflation and in spite of the beneficial effects of the maastricht criteria of which you were talking there are countries such as spain which have an inflation rate which is double that of germany
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Negative;0.654397189617157;what risks do you see in this situation in the long run
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9118406772613525;and what could these countries do to try to keep inflation under control
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9797858595848083;duisenberg well what countries outside the spectrum cannot do is use monetary policy to fight inflation
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9728713035583496;they will therefore have to revert to all other areas of policy and behaviour
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9226394295692444;and this is not only a call for government action
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9878007173538208;it is also a call for social partners to try to get back in line with the average for the euro area and ultimately to get back in line with the goal that monetary policy has set for itself namely keeping inflation below 2
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.5028108954429626;question mr duisenberg in the light of your decision to leave the m3 reference rate unchanged and also in the light of the comments you have just made about the risks to price stability do you think that there is any danger that in the minds of the markets you will only serve to underline the differences between a very activist progrowth federal reserve and a more conservative more priceorientated european central bank
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Negative;0.8545781373977661;i also wanted to ask about the following there does seem to be some slowdown at least in the reversal of capital flows between the united states and the euro zone and since you were trumpeting this some time ago i wonder if you could comment on this issue
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.94647616147995;duisenberg i do not see that much of a difference if at all between the degree of activism of the federal reserve system on the one hand and the european central bank on the other
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.8779594302177429;it is true that we have a welldefined primary target a primary mandate in our policy namely maintaining price stability whereas the mandate of the federal reserve is much broader in scope
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9879205226898193;it includes the promotion of economic growth an equitable income even balance of payments behaviour as well as of course inflation
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9620640873908997;but as different as the circumstances of their respective economies may be i cannot really see any difference in the actual behaviour of the two central banks
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.945656418800354;so this is also something the markets should understand
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.8734179139137268;as regards the second question could you christian say something on this 
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9495384097099304;noyer  on this slowdown in capital flows or on capital flows in general
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9655120372772217;we do not have any new figures compared with what we had discussed before
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.8728874325752258;i apologise for this but i do not think we have released much in the meantime
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9187008738517761;so this is probably a question which should be raised at a later occasion once we have new evidence
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9502409100532532;question mr president what kind of information what kind of knowledge can the financial community gain from the publication of the macroeconomic projections in the next monthly bulletin and how do you expect the financial markets to react to their publication
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9286777973175049;how are they supposed to handle them
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9840711355209351;duisenberg they will see that we will publish some macroeconomic indicators in terms of ranges of projected developments
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9863877296447754;the public will have to understand and we will make it very clear that these projections are based on certain hypotheses concerning in particular interest rates and exchange rates which will supposedly remain unchanged in the future
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9824983477592468;thus the projections will be based on hypotheses which to be honest will in all likelihood not turn out to be true in the future
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9853723645210266;thus the projections to put it differently are likely to move out of line with real developments in the future
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9615440964698792;but as a central bank we will never as some other institutions do create expectations or formulate certain hypotheses about underlying variables which are crucial to us like the exchange rate or shortterm interest rates
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Negative;0.5782568454742432;we will never make them into a selffulfilling prophecy
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9509192109107971;so we have to base these expectations on these hypotheses in public
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9601680636405945;and the media and academia will have to understand that and i think they will
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9730186462402344;if everyone understands them in this way they will make our deliberations even more transparent by showing on what hypotheses our deliberations  those of the governing council are what i am now talking about  are basically wellfounded
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Negative;0.6655179858207703;question mr president one of the big issues in nice was the attempt to streamline the decisionmaking process in the european union with a view to the accession of new countries from eastern europe
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9690222144126892;do the decisions that have been reached there have any bearing on your thinking or maybe even decisionmaking process or on your own institution and the decisionmaking process in the governing council since the situation seems to be similar to the situation in the european commission for example
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9846652150154114;duisenberg no but what the intergovernmental conference has done is take a decision to propose a change to article 10 of the statute of the european system of central banks and of the european central bank which relates to the voting procedures
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9825698733329773;this would consist of including in the treaty an enabling clause
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9723308086395264;this clause would make it possible in the future if the number of members of the eurosystem  not of the european union but of the eurosystem  were to increase significantly to change the procedures of the decisionmaking bodies of the eurosystem
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9892873764038086;this change could then be enacted by a decision of the eu council in the composition of the heads of state or government on a recommendation of the governing council of the ecb which would in that case have to be made unanimously and after having consulted the european commission and the european parliament or on the recommendation of the european commission after having consulted the european central bank and the european parliament
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9810705184936523;so it is an enabling clause which is to be included in the treaty
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9767391681671143;the enabling clause itself has  as do all other decisions  to be ratified by all parliaments of the eu member states and this is expected to take some time  i believe that it is expected that the ratification procedure may take up to two years
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.8348333835601807;question mr president you mentioned the seminar tomorrow in vienna
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.7050550580024719;but are you worried by the changes in the heads of some central banks in the european union accession countries namely in the czech republic and to a lesser extent in poland
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.6279563903808594;how do you view this issue
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.38492482900619507;thank you
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9690461158752441;duisenberg well in both cases the governors of the central banks concerned have left of their own free will and fully independently
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9628798365592957;one has taken on a position in london the other is taking up a position in basel
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9075143337249756;so i do not see that as being of any relevance to the accession process as such
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Negative;0.6359929442405701;question translation a question mr president if in euroland you see a potential growth of between 2 and 25 and if you assume that economic growth is over 3 this year and will probably be over 3 next year and perhaps in 2002 the simple question is are there going to be bottlenecks
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Negative;0.878001868724823;are there going to be capacity bottlenecks and do you think that this may have a negative impact on price stability
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9261363744735718;then with regard to the enlargement process a second question president welteke from the deutsche bundesbank has said over and over again that it is a question of real convergence not nominal convergence of the maastricht criteria but real convergence in terms of the maturity of an economy legislation and privatisation
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Negative;0.8176010251045227;is this a concern for the ecb if these countries join the eu and then soon after the euro area
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Negative;0.9557689428329468;duisenberg first we do not see the likely or expected development of the real economy for the foreseeable future as in itself being a danger to price stability as we define it
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.6325335502624512;alongside the expectation of a continuation of what we call a robust pace of economic growth we also expect the level of inflation to come down gradually over the medium term to within the limits we have set ourselves which define price stability namely to under 2
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Negative;0.9779329299926758;however we have to cope with the in principle temporary effect of the huge increase in oil prices which is permeating the economies
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Negative;0.9124669432640076;as far as the convergence process for the accession countries is concerned when the time comes ie
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.991337776184082;after having become a member of the european union the accession countries will have to demonstrate that they are converging in the direction of the average performance of the euro area and we will assess this when the time comes at the time when they actually want or desire to participate in monetary union as well which is more than just the european union
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.970421314239502;we will write a convergence report at that time but not at this point
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.990822434425354;but that convergence report will then be based on  or will use  the same criteria as those that are currently being used and that have been used for all present and future members of monetary union
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9073449969291687;question i would like to come back to the question of the m3 reference value
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9494248628616333;you have stuck with the estimate of trend potential growth in the euro zone of 225 
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.7528337240219116;is it your view that trend potential growth in the united states is higher than that which you have stuck with in the euro zone
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9381074905395508;and i would also like to know whether at the council meeting today there was anybody at all any council member who ventured to suggest that trend potential growth was in fact higher than 225  in the euro zone
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9086980819702148;duisenberg we discussed this extensively
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.8623626232147217;of course we discuss the question has the new economy arrived in europe
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9582630395889282; because that is basically your question  extensively almost every two weeks 
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9173044562339783;we sometimes feel that it has arrived here and there but taking a euro area perspective for the euro area as a whole on all the available evidence we cannot as yet conclude that a decisive shift in the trend rate of productivity growth is discernible
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.7860461473464966;we hope it will come we may even think it will come but it has not come yet
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.957255482673645;question mr noyer you mentioned in your introductory statement that legal acts were adopted concerning the allocation of monetary income of the euro area
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9305768609046936;does that mean that there were any changes made to the current regulation
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9805662631988525;noyer i hope i said  and if i did not i will correct myself  that it was for the years 19992001 so that covers the period in which we do not have euro banknotes only national banknotes
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9771562814712524;in the governing council we did take decisions on a number of small issues for tiny amounts where we had already pooled the monetary income but they were not material
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9641566276550293;and you will see when the text is published that it is just to be in line with our principle of transparency and clarity about the rules we have adopted that we progressively publish in all official community languages the previous decisions when they are consolidated but there is nothing new
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.8122574090957642;i mean the issue you may have in mind has not yet been decided
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.6628175973892212;question a second question on this
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9696394801139832;here in germany there is a discussion among academics on the redistribution effects of the seigniorage and when mr welteke was asked about this issue he answered that yes negotiations are already under way with regard to the redistribution effects after these three years ie
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9852290749549866;after 2001 in order to alleviate these effects for another period which is possible under the treaty
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9094827771186829;so could you say something about this point please
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9878708720207214;noyer i can only say that the governing council needs to take a decision in order to implement one of several articles of the statute concerning the issuance of the banknotes and the precise features of income distribution or redistribution whether there will be any need  in the judgement of the governing council  for smoothing and if so how the features of this smoothing will be based on provisions contained in the statute and the treaty
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9900738000869751;such decisions have to be taken before the end of next year ie
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9756209254264832;before the issuance of euro banknotes
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9752798080444336;for issues other than banknotes the decision was already taken earlier and will be published shortly in a consolidated version but this is not material as i have said
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.8803973197937012;i cannot say anything more for the moment
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9814901947975159;the governing council will take decisions in good time before the end of next year
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.8798906207084656;that is all
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.6893617510795593;question president duisenberg two brief questions
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.9291132688522339;the first one is could you please elaborate a bit on the added value that you think the publication of the projections will bring about in terms of transparency
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.5260878205299377;the second question is when you switched to the variablerate tender in summer you said that you were thinking of ways to overcome the problem of overbidding in the fixedrate tender
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.8358951210975647;has there been any solution or has there been any discussion about switching back to the fixedrate tender yet
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.7324806451797485;duisenberg last question first
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Negative;0.610933780670166;the discussions on finding a solution to the overbidding phenomenon if we were to return to the fixedrate tender procedure are still going on
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.936174750328064;so we are still looking but it seems that it would be feasible to at least largely overcome that problem if it were to arise again with the available solutions
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Neutral;0.8136674761772156;the publication of projections which will take place for the first time next week will in itself simply enhance the transparency of and therefore the insight that the outside world has into the internal deliberations of the ecb
2000-12-14;2000;December;REPORT;Positive;0.9820384979248047;it will make our decisionmaking process more readily understandable and that i think is a great added value
