2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.948810338973999;ecb press conference introductory statement willem f duisenberg president of the european central bank christian noyer vicepresident of the european central bank frankfurt am main 8 june 2000 with the transcript of the questions and answers ladies and gentlemen the vicepresident and i are here to report on the outcome of todays meetings of the general council and the governing council of the ecb
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9570582509040833;the governing council took the following monetary policy decisions the interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the eurosystem will be raised by 050 percentage point to 425 and applied in the two operations which will be conducted as fixed rate tenders to be settled on 15 and 21 june 2000 the interest rate on the marginal lending facility will be raised by 050 percentage point to 525 with effect from 9 june 2000 the interest rate on the deposit facility will be raised by 050 percentage point to 325 with effect from 9 june 2000 starting from the operation to be settled on 28 june 2000 the main refinancing operations of the eurosystem will be conducted as variable rate tenders applying the multiple rate auction procedure
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.986283540725708;the governing council has decided to set a minimum bid rate for these operations equal to 425
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9881603717803955;this is the same rate as that which will prevail for the two fixed rate tenders to be implemented following todays decision
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9691699743270874;let me start by commenting on the reasons for this rise in interest rates before the vicepresident says a few words about the move to a variable rate tender procedure
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9784422516822815;over recent months the risks to price stability in the medium term have clearly continued to increase
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9867086410522461;this assessment has been supported by the information from both the first pillar and the second pillar of the eurosystems monetary policy strategy
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9900566935539246;with regard to the first pillar strong growth of money and credit throughout 1999 and the pronounced expansion of money and credit aggregates over the first four months of 2000 have strengthened the view that liquidity conditions are ample
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9845063090324402;as for the second pillar in a phase of strong growth upward risks to price stability currently relate mainly to the spillover of rising import prices to consumer prices owing both to the lagged effects of the exchange rate depreciation and to rising oil prices
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9895329475402832;in fact most inflation forecasts have been revised upwards over recent months
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Negative;0.882501482963562;this is a matter of concern
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9828868508338928;todays increase in ecb interest rates is a decisive step to address these upside risks to price stability and it will contribute to the continuation of noninflationary growth in the euro area
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9053657054901123;allow me to give you a more detailed overview of the main elements of our assessment of monetary financial market and other economic developments
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9543340802192688;let me start by addressing the latest monetary developments in the euro area
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9837903380393982;the threemonth average of the annual growth rates of m3 covering the period from february to april 2000 was 63 ie
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9680854082107544;significantly above the reference value of 4 12
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Negative;0.5125011205673218;thus the most recent m3 data confirm that the liquidity situation in the euro area continues to be very generous
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9357748627662659;m3 growth deviated from the reference value in 1999 and growth rates increased further in early 2000 this picture of very generous liquidity conditions in the euro area is complemented by the rapid expansion of credit to the private sector which remained close to or above 10 throughout 1999 and exceeded 11 in april 2000 taken together such developments would clearly point to upside risks to price stability over the medium term if not counteracted in time
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.979303240776062;turning to the second pillar we have to consider economic and financial market developments as well as consumer price developments
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9920233488082886;looking at economic developments the outlook for growth in the euro area has improved markedly over the past few months
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9888423681259155;overall indicators for economic activity released since the end of last year point to continued strong growth following the upturn in real gdp growth in the second half of 1999 all the forecasts currently available from major international organisations and private institutions now project real gdp growth to be above 3 this year and next year which is significantly higher than expected at the end of last year
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9908972382545471;this positive outlook reflects favourable domestic and external conditions for growth
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9922717809677124;on the domestic side expansion of private consumption and investment should benefit in particular from ongoing employment growth and higher rates of capacity utilisation
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9907006025314331;domestic demand is also supported by high business and consumer confidence
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9922099113464355;on the external side the upturn of growth in the world economy appears to be stronger faster and more broadly based than was expected at the end of last year
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9892276525497437;hence euro area exports should remain strong
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9780009984970093;financial market developments also support the view that the economic expansion in the euro area is set to continue at a fast pace
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9928258657455444;moreover the exchange rate of the euro appreciated at the end of may and in the first few days of june also reflecting expectations that robust economic growth will continue in the euro area
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9875456690788269;notwithstanding the recent appreciation of the euro the extent and duration of its previous depreciation will still exert upward pressure on consumer prices
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Negative;0.7406430244445801;against this background the outlook for consumer price developments had become less favourable prior to todays meeting
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9903846979141235;in april 2000 inflation  as measured by the harmonised index of consumer prices hicp  was 19 following 21 in march
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9838539958000183;in the immediate future the strong rise in oil prices in may 2000 is pointing to renewed shortterm upward pressures
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.8453576564788818;looking further ahead all available forecasts for consumer price inflation for this year and next are now higher than they were at the end of 1999 current projections of a rate of inflation of around 2 in 2000 and 2001 are clear warning signals
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.727675199508667;in conclusion with todays decisions the governing council has acted in a forwardlooking manner in order to contribute to the maintenance of favourable conditions for a lasting noninflationary economic expansion
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9610578417778015;this should help other economic actors to rely firmly on the maintenance of price stability in the medium term
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9767867922782898;they are also called upon to contribute to price stability and growth by means of appropriate wage settlements compatible with employment growth structural reform and fiscal consolidation
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Negative;0.7119418978691101;at the current juncture they are especially encouraged to press ahead with structural reform and governments are particularly urged to avoid a procyclical loosening of fiscal policies
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9729024171829224;this is particularly important in those countries where there is a risk of overheating
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9839771389961243;let me now give the floor to the vicepresident to say a few words about the decision to implement a variable rate tender procedure as from the main refinancing operation to be settled on 28 june 2000 the switch to variable rate tenders in the main refinancing operations is not intended as a further change in the monetary policy stance of the eurosystem
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.952011227607727;the new tender mechanism is a response to the severe overbidding which has developed in the context of the current fixed rate tender procedure
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9939508438110352;for the purpose of signalling the monetary policy stance the minimum bid rate is designed to play the role performed until now by the rate in fixed rate tenders
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9897364377975464;this change does not in any way rule out the option that in the future the main refinancing operations of the eurosystem may be conducted in principle as fixed rate tenders
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9682323336601257;a press release setting out a comprehensive description of the new tender procedure will be issued during the course of next week
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9645622372627258;turning to todays other meeting the general council considered public finance developments in the eu
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9887443780899048;the general council also carried out its first annual review of the functioning of the erm ii in accordance with article 16 of the erm ii agreement
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9287391901016235;finally let me draw your attention to the calendar for meetings of the governing council and general council in 2001 a separate press release listing the dates as well as the related dates for the press conferences will be made available to you this afternoon
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.772260844707489;in this context i should also like to point out that the press conference previously announced for 3 august 2000 has been cancelled
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9318070411682129;we are now at your disposal should you have any questions
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9272608160972595;transcript of the questions asked and the answers given by dr willem f duisenberg president of the ecb and christian noyer vicepresident of the ecb question i have a question regarding your new method of allocating money to the markets in three weeks time
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9741154909133911;it appears that you will in a way have an american auction system from 28 june onwards
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9814057946205139;at the same time you are saying that the minimum bid level is your target rate basically
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.7681475877761841;is that a correct understanding
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9146499633789062;is that a target rate
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9689903855323792;are you combining an american system with a fedlike target rate system
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.8525595664978027;and second are you not afraid now given that you have not introduced a ceiling  no bidding range only a minimum bid level  are you not afraid that the markets will drive up rates way above 425
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9803186058998108;in other words that you have now increased interest rates by 50 basis points plus an amount of growth which we cannot determine today as from three weeks time
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9739853739738464;noyer well in answer to your first question no you cannot say it is a target rate because the tender procedure which we will then use is technically very different from the procedure that the fed uses to influence the market
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9908466935157776;the signalling effect of what was previously our refinancing rate in a fixed rate tender will now be provided by the minimum bid rate
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9441310167312622;but we will not be targeting that rate as such
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.986799418926239;now it is a fact of course and it is the experience of many national central banks which used different types of variable rate tenders before the euro that market rates normally come close to the minimum rate
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.949912965297699;it is the market forces that bring them down it is not a target in the sense that you could say the federal reserve has a target
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9594177007675171;on your second question normally there are binding mechanisms which mean that it cannot move very far from the minimum
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.757915735244751;but this is mainly due to market forces
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Negative;0.668062150478363;if you bid very high then it is very likely that market rates will be lower than the rate at which you will be allocated central bank money
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Negative;0.6647845506668091;so you risk losing money
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9633510112762451;a builtin mechanism brings rates closer to the minimum bid rate
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9567435383796692;question mr president or mr vicepresident why did you not add up the full allotment in fixed rate tenders instead of deciding to switch to variable tenders
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.5509958863258362;why do you think that the latter is the better system or is it just the current situation
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9167697429656982;noyer well there are many possible technical devices
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9493066668510437;this one was seen as closer to the one that we had wanted from the beginning
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9544970989227295;i should like to remind you that from the outset we had said that we had two possible tools
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.968966007232666;one was fixed rate tenders and the other was variable rate tenders
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9797273874282837;for the fixed rate tenders we started with the idea that we should be able to provide the market with approximately the liquidity that we thought it needed
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9847020506858826;this is very much how this was done before by most central banks in the euro area
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.985886812210083;if you move to a 100 fixed rate allocation system a fixed rate tender allocation system then you leave the amount of liquidity that it would draw from the central bank completely in the hands of the market
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9306257963180542;it is quite a different system and the consequences would have to be studied extremely carefully
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9585123658180237;it has of course worked in small countries whether it can work in a large area is difficult to assess but this is certainly something we have considered
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9894809722900391;for variable rates by contrast we had said from the beginning that we wanted to have that tool available and we have studied the various possible features of this variable rate system for many months
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9655017852783203;now finally we have found out that the best possible way to use it would be relatively close in terms of signalling procedure to the fixed rate tender so that we could shift from one to the other without blurring market players at all ie
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9821733236312866;a combination of the variable rate tender with a minimum bid rate
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9873062372207642;then you have a tool which provides the signalling effect that we had before in the fixed rate tenders
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9537120461463928;duisenberg and i would like to reiterate and reemphasise that this switch to the variable rate tender procedure in no way implies a change in monetary policy stance
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Negative;0.8732280731201172;it is purely inspired by the worsening situation in the bidding process whereby the last two allotment ratios were less than 1 each at 088 and 087 respectively which made it almost ridiculous
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9490965604782104;that is what triggered this move to the new system
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9526174068450928;but we still want to be as much in the lead in giving interest rate signals as we were under the fixed rate tender system
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.7787463068962097;however i should also add that this switch in no way rules out the possibility that we may at some point return to the fixed rate tender system
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.6711322665214539;question mr president in the past as recently as some testimony that you gave earlier this year in brussels you said that a halfpoint move by the european central bank could signal a hiatus in future moves
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.7888912558555603;i was wondering if that is the signal you are trying to give now
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9222107529640198;duisenberg no one of the motives to move by half a point is that in our view such a move will clear the horizon for some time to come
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.7439342737197876;we do not know for how long
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9562336802482605;we wanted to give certainty and clarity to the markets for some time to come
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9485328197479248;question so financial markets should not expect every six weeks
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9604933857917786;duisenberg well i do not know what financial markets will expect but we think with this move we have cleared the horizon although it may be a moving horizon
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.7049289345741272;question translation mr president i would like to have your feeling on a few things
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.8267050981521606;do you think that the previous rises in rates have had a favourable effect on the euro exchange rate which is now appreciating against the dollar
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9116002917289734;that is the first question
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9610432386398315;second question do you not think that we are going to accredit the idea that for the ecb a rate of growth of 3 is the maximum rate of growth that the euro area can support
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.8762389421463013;duisenberg the previous hikes in interest rates may have had an effect on the turnaround in the sentiment about the exchange rate
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9744638800621033;if that is so then it is only welcome
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9580734968185425;but those interest rate moves and the one of today were in no way a reaction to the exchange rate developments because we do not have as you know an exchange rate target
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.6659634709358215;yet as a side effect if they have helped to change the sentiment then we are only grateful
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9351691007614136;the current forecasts for growth for both years as i have said by many institutions and our own analysis point to a rate of growth in excess of 3 both in 2000 and in 2001 but there still is underutilisation of capacity  the output gap may be closing but i would not say that we would want to cap growth in any way at this stage and at this rate
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9348506927490234;on the contrary we believe that the interest rate move of today creates the conditions for a sustained period of noninflationary but high growth
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9844776391983032;question laurent fabius suggested making proposals at the end of the month or the beginning of july to reinforce the euro11
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9764854907989502;at the same time the euro11 through its declaration of 8 may 2000 seems to have influenced the level of the euro exchange rate
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.4581776559352875;in this respect are you in favour of strengthening this group or is it already strong enough
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.6194812059402466;and the second question in its annual report published at the beginning of the week the bis explicitly questioned the clarity of the two pillars of the monetary policy strategy of the ecb
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9470571279525757;what is your opinion in terms of how the public understands your strategy
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9691886901855469;duisenberg on the euro11 that is still an informal organisation with which the ecb is in a continuous dialogue
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9806345701217651;the organisation of the euro11 is a matter for ministers and not for the european central bank
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.664891242980957;the position of the european central bank is very clear and welldefined in the treaty of maastricht
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9661657810211182;so whatever way the ministers organise themselves it does not  i am inclined to say  affect the position or the cooperation of the european central bank
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9181681275367737;as for how the public perceives our twopillar strategy admittedly it is not a simple strategy
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Positive;0.6265875697135925;we do our utmost to explain our two pillarbased strategy and we have the impression that it is becoming better and better understood
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9813232421875;i recall that in the past days a few outside experts  basing themselves explicitly on the reasoning in our twopillar strategy  came to the conclusion that if you applied this strategy then there was no question but to think that the ecb would raise interest rates by 50 basis points
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.8971455693244934;well they at least had understood it
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.7681018710136414;question mr duisenberg i have a followup question on the euro11
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9182989597320557;where are you drawing the line and what is an acceptable development
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9820871949195862;they say that the euro11 chairman would regularly comment on monetary policy the exchange rate and so on
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Negative;0.7859033346176147;would that be a problem
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Negative;0.8533031940460205;or where do you think there could be a problem
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Negative;0.7013989090919495;duisenberg i do not really see a problem
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9840064644813538;the competence for exchange rates is also clearly defined in the treaty
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.981787919998169;for daytoday business and if there are no specific exchange rate arrangements there is only one institution competent for exchange rates  and that is the european central bank
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9782688021659851;what ministers can do and may do at some point perhaps is to give general orientations
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.980273962020874;they can only do so in consultation with or on a proposal from the european central bank
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Negative;0.717315673828125;so i do not see any problem there
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.8348158001899719;i must say that in the continuous dialogue which the european central bank has with the euro11 we have managed to an ever greater degree let me put it that way to restrain ourselves both governors and ministers from making comments about monetary or exchange rate developments
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Positive;0.6012558937072754;admittedly we may not be 100 successful but to my mind we are increasingly successful in speaking with one voice  both ministers and governors
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9740007519721985;question mr president did you vote today or did you reach your decisions through discussions
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.8858027458190918;duisenberg you will be aware that i never comment on that
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9593201279640198;we had an intensive discussion a prolonged discussion which was very useful and in the end resulted in a consensus on what we had to do

2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9666407704353333;question mr milton friedman the nobel prizewinning economist has said that the euro is up to 25 undervalued against the dollar
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.8994506001472473;is that something you could adjust to
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9299538731575012;duisenberg i know that the exchange rate of the euro even after the recent appreciation does not yet reflect the fundamentals whatever they may be
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9160094857215881;but i am not in a position to declare a certain value to be the right value
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9579333662986755;that is what the markets decide
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9260194301605225;and when it does reflect the fundamentals you will not hear me saying anything either
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9789177775382996;question the european finance ministers are expecting huge revenues from auctions of mobile licences and privatisation and possibly also higher tax incomes
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9608100652694702;do you have any advice on how they should spend that income  for instance on reducing the deficits or debt
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.7295638918876648;duisenberg yes i already implicitly gave that advice in my introductory statement as we urge governments in this high growth period not to exert procyclical impulses through tax reductions which would endanger the inflation performance of the euro area economy
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9507784247398376;so by implication that means that we hope these extra revenues as they come in be they from privatisation or licensing of gsm features or from cyclically higher tax revenues will be used to the maximum extent possible to strengthen the process of consolidation of the public finances in other words to reduce the deficit and to reduce the burden of debt
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9133945107460022;question i was wondering whether the ecb is just mirroring the fed and also whether there is a risk that this sort of rate rise is overkill given that there are still 18 million unemployed in europe
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.6848921179771423;duisenberg on the first question i do not think that we are mirroring the fed
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Negative;0.5623924136161804;on the question of overkill we had of course thought of that but we did not see that danger
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9291577339172363;i would like to point out that even after the increase of today  and now i am talking about shortterm interest rates  rates are still at a level which should encourage growth given the prospects of the noninflationary environment promoted by this move
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Positive;0.8018268346786499;it will promote growth rather than stifle it and i would also like to point out that the case of the united states proves that you can have a very high rate of growth with considerably higher interest rates than those prevailing in europe
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.8830515146255493;question may i just go back to the tender
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9718261361122131;mr noyer you have pointed out that we are to get more details on the tender next week
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.7217048406600952;could you go a little more into detail now
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9820727109909058;so say for example you get bids starting from 45 how would the allotment be effected
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9455634951591492;would you allot all the money down to 425 or are you intending to give quotas if there is a concentration of bids
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.6912729144096375;could you detail that a little more
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9861543774604797;noyer trying to answer your request and at the same time keeping matters simple at this stage it will be in the form of an american auction ie
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9876447319984436;all the banks will get the liquidity at the price that they have requested down to what we call the marginal rate
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9850904941558838;that is the rate at which we stop providing liquidity or the last rate at which we will provide liquidity
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9879657626152039;all the requests made at higher levels of interest rates will be served 100
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9819583296775818;at the marginal rate the ecb may allot either 100 or less
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9204238057136536;that depends on the global amount we want to provide
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9026312232017517;and how will this amount of liquidity be decided
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9813521504402161;well more or less exactly as it was or is being done under the fixed rate tender system
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9798563718795776;we compute the level of liquidity we think the banking sector needs and then allocate according to these needs taking into account all the various factors not only the minimum reserves but all the factors that influence liquidity
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9775277972221375;for the purpose of giving some clarity to all market players it is our intention when we announce the tender to signal what we believe the liquidity needs to be
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.8335723876953125;we will not say we will allocate x billion because this has to be finetuned until the last moment and we cannot  nobody can  know in advance exactly how much liquidity will be needed
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9538751840591431;our intention is to give some kind of forecast of the liquidity needs to the market so that it helps market participants to make their own computations of how they will make their proposals or requests in the tender procedure
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Negative;0.5652878880500793;this has been much simplified but i hope it clarifies matters somewhat
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9543866515159607;if it does not i am sorry you will have to wait another week unless you ask me more precise questions that ill forget to answer
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.6047658324241638;question mr president two questions for you
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9252676367759705;one you said the current level of interest rates still promotes growth
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.4961226284503937;would you say that the current monetary policy is still accommodative or have we reached a neutral stance
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9772376418113708;the second question is comparing todays moves with the last two interest rate hikes in february and march when you raised rates by 25 basis points whereas  today  you have raised them by 50 basis points something must have accelerated in the last six weeks
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.8940675854682922;can you be a little bit more precise on what exactly triggered todays 50 basis point move
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.5724000930786133;duisenberg
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.8964322805404663;on the first question not knowing what the neutral rate is i cannot answer the question whether or not we are still accommodative
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.7777895331382751;i think we are
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Negative;0.6649667620658875;but even after this interest rate hike one thing is certain we are less accommodative than we were before
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.724961519241333;on your second question well an assessment as i gave it to you of all recent indicators and comparing them with the assessment we had made towards the end of last year they increasingly point to significantly higher future inflation than we thought only four months ago
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9905828237533569;and these are the monetary indicators the forecasts made by others the development of the exchange rates up until two weeks ago the development of oil prices  there has been some decline but an immediate rebound after that  all make us increasingly concerned that over the medium term inflation might  if we did not act decisively  exceed the 2 limit which we have set for ourselves
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9637065529823303;we believe that with this move combined with the moves we have made since november last year we will avoid that danger
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.8287793397903442;question translation mr president a further question
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.8741104602813721;how long do you think you are going to need to raise the interest rates for them to bite
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9171708822250366;i mean there are american german dutch positions on that
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.8750505447387695;this was the first question
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.90944904088974;the second question is that the dollar is a yoyo
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9704388976097107;is the euro also a yoyo currency
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Negative;0.5688273906707764;you said that you were not quite happy with the current exchange rate
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.656725287437439;could you tell us exactly how unsatisfied you are
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9397509694099426;is it on a scale of 1 2 3
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Negative;0.7071186900138855;duisenberg to answer the last question first i said the exchange rate in my opinion has  in the past in recent months  clearly overshot a level which could be regarded as being more in line with the fundamentals
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Negative;0.6865190267562866;and the reversal which started about two weeks ago still leaves i believe some potential for further appreciation
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.7956982254981995;to what level as i already said earlier i cannot say
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.8896177411079407;the yoyo  no  the volatility is very high even in the course of a trading day
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9698758125305176;but a yoyo
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.7754301428794861;i would not say that
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9914010167121887;the euro has depreciated over the last 12 months at a steady almost continuous pace  there is nothing yoyo about that  and that trend now seems to have reversed
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9697985649108887;so if you call this a yoyo then at least it is a longterm yoyo
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9143662452697754;question translation i had asked whether the dollar being a yoyo currency means that the euro is one too
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9174558520317078;duisenberg i do not talk about currencies in terms of yoyos
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9022532105445862;question i have a question for each of you if i may
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9831485748291016;mr president was there anybody at todays meeting among the 17 members who thought that the rise would be possible by just going up by 025 basis points rather than a whole half percentage point
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9196321964263916;and for the vicepresident summing up the refinancing procedure that is starting at the end of this month could you say that it represents a decisive shift in favour of letting the market influence the interest rate more than the central bank
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Negative;0.593052864074707;i was struck by what the president said to the effect that the ecb still wanted to have quite a bit influence over this
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.8592631220817566;but on the face of it it looks like a move more toward the markets
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.8690676093101501;duisenberg if i may answer the question first
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9727703332901001;when we started the discussion there was more than one who was inclined more to go for 25 than for 50 basis points
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.966152012348175;but then you have a discussion which takes hours and you exchange all the arguments
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9872776865959167;and in the end as i said we reached a consensus that the measures would be what they are and as they have been decided
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9602130055427551;noyer on the second question i would not say that it is in any way a step towards giving the markets more influence on the decisions or monetary policy or actions  whatever you call it  of the central bank
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9883771538734436;i think you should consider what will be the average rate in the tenders or even the marginal rate as absolutely comparable to the market rates
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9902369379997253;so whatever difference there might be between the average rate of a tender the marginal rate and the minimum rate it should be considered in exactly the same way as you would consider the difference between overnight or oneweektwoweek rates as compared with the fixed tender rate
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9892536997795105;so really this is why i said the minimum rate has the same signalling effect as the fixed rate had in the fixed tender procedure
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9028477072715759;but of course there are technical differences
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.8658233284950256;we are not tightening or keeping the market at a certain given rate through constant interventions in the money markets
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.971549928188324;we will let the market play its role
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Positive;0.6767997741699219;and what the market does is actually interesting
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9817461967468262;it provides us with information that is part a small part of our global assessment of what is going on and how market players themselves analyse the same sort of economic indicators we are looking at
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.7602881789207458;question mr president i would like to take you up on the question of oil prices
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9539909958839417;first of all how do you see oil prices evolving and do you feel that the reversal in oil prices is something that will continue and is a worrying trend
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Negative;0.7570472955703735;you have obviously highlighted your concerns about inflation today that is quite clear
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9311822056770325;do you see that there is a longerterm average price for a barrel of crude that is acceptable in your eyes
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.8181976079940796;and third how do you see this evolving into price anticipation of consumers given many of the commercial interests which mean that falling prices tend not to be passed on to the consumers as quickly as rising prices
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9772307276725769;duisenberg when we look at the oil prices we of course also look at futures
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.938408613204956;and the futures indicate that the oil price may at some point fall but they have already done that for a long time
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Negative;0.7310892343521118;the oil price is not falling and has not fallen
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9691325426101685;so we try to assess to the best of our knowledge what is not always an accurate guide
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9592851400375366;and i have actually asked the same question you have just asked me i asked my colleague from saudi arabia that question last weekend and i got an answer which was as vague as that which i am giving you
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.8554637432098389;will it work its way through
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Negative;0.5746538043022156;will it push consumer prices up or down
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9582250714302063;i think the evidence indicates yes with a lag but in both directions
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.8332580327987671;when oil prices come down you will  after a while  also see petrol prices coming down for the consumer and you even saw that happening by a few cents this week and when they go up you see with a lag  which may be several months on average  that these prices work their way through to the consumer price level as well
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.8855758309364319;whether there is an optimum price  as was asked  i would not know
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9604516625404358;there probably is but not for the central bank
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9659894704818726;question mr noyer am i right in assuming that with a minimum bid rate you signal the market that the rates should go up and with a maximum bid rate you would signal the market that the rates should go down
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Negative;0.6462434530258179;noyer i think that very theoretically maximum bid rates can only work in a situation where there are strong expectations that the central bank might wish to cut rates
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9544159770011902;in that way yes
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9838613867759705;but in a normal stance where there is no great anticipation in one or the other direction  for very technical reasons but you may already have seen that with the fixed rate tender  money market rates are normally on average  that does not mean every day  a few basis points above the rate at which the central bank provides liquidity
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.6870533227920532;for that reason the system can normally work much better with a minimum rate than with a maximum rate
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9729253649711609;so it is just that the signalling effect  even if theoretically it could be provided by both systems  works well only with a minimum rate system
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.686528205871582;question mr president two months ago here at that point you said that inflation would come back to below 2
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.8813726902008057;now your projection is around 2 inflation for 2000 and 2001 what has changed since that time
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.6378399729728699;is the reason for your higher projection the oil price
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Negative;0.9514062404632568;is inflation pressure coming from imported inflation
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9406981468200684;is it coming from rate inflation
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.5075626969337463;or what has changed
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9392791390419006;duisenberg to answer the last question first i think you have to distinguish between two things
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9787107110023499;what i said two months ago was a statement about the monthtomonth path of inflation which was to be expected for the near future
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9610903263092041;and already then even earlier i gave an indication that it should not be excluded  as we saw the path developing  that temporarily it would even exceed 2 in the actual figures
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Negative;0.4990013539791107;and i forecast that that would be only temporary that it would come down
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9166468977928162;so far i have been proven right by the facts  the april figure being under 2 again although the march figure was 21
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9868482947349548;in a mediumterm outlook  i am now talking about the average inflation figures for the full years 2000 and 2001  the average inflation figure is now expected to be very close to 2
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9567450881004333;perhaps on the basis of some forecasts it could even go over that average figure
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.8319700956344604;and why is that so
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.7928831577301025;that is because of the many factors i have mentioned
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Positive;0.8767585754394531;and the main one is that the higher than expected import prices as a result of higher than expected oil prices other raw material prices and the prolonged depressed state of the exchange rate will work their way through more than could be anticipated two or four months ago
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.6684680581092834;and it is to counter that development that we have taken measures today to prevent the forecasts for 2000 and 2001 from becoming true
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.7467805743217468;question translation two questions
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.8652434349060059;is my impression right that the first pillar of your strategy is gaining more and more in importance because it is reliable
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9419215321540833;second question the reference level of 4 12
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9731907248497009;you have a trend rate of growth of 2 12 as being calculated into that
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9121491312980652;now does that mean that over 3 economic growth at the moment is the reason why inflation could be above 2
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.5710617899894714;or are you expecting a higher potential rate of growth
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9839773774147034;duisenberg there is no change in weighting since we have never weighted the first and the second pillars
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9880126714706421;and if we could give you a ratio a mathematical ratio between the weight of the first and that of the second pillar then we would also be in a position mathematically to reduce the two pillars to one
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9560051560401917;it is as simple as that
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9713929891586304;so there is no change in the weighting  which is a qualitative assessment
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Positive;0.9893463253974915;the strong growth we foresee goes along also with what we are observing  a rather strong increase in productivity
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.8349511623382568;and whether that will lead to a higher potential growth rate is something we do not know yet
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9909189939498901;the reference value of 4 12 was indeed based as you say on an estimate of the trend rate of growth or the potential rate of growth of output of about 2 14 which is the trend rate observed over the past 25 years
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9866586327552795;it is a reference value only something to use for comparison from which conclusions can be drawn
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9846066236495972;it will be reviewed every year
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9137428402900696;and then we have to come to a judgement on whether or not that 2 12 hypothesis can still be regarded as valid
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9633244276046753;but we will only do that in december this year
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9477076530456543;question mr duisenberg in may you said you will only talk about interventions when you do so
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9521583318710327;so did you do so today or in the last four weeks
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9436885714530945;the second question is about the horizon is the horizon cleared up to september given that you have cancelled the press conference in august
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.8082547783851624;duisenberg in answer to the first question i did not talk about intervention today
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.919407308101654;so you may conclude that we did not intervene
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.949457585811615;and i said that i would only talk about interventions ex post ie
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9641457796096802;after we have intervened and then immediately thereafter
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.7854469418525696;so no discussions about interventions
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.735842764377594;and the fact that we cancelled the press conference on 3 august has nothing to do with our decisions today
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9851639270782471;it has everything to do  i shall be honest enough to say  with the fact that it is an awkward date to have a meeting
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9831216931343079;because in many countries the summer holidays will already have started and we are doing our utmost to arrange the agenda for that meeting in such a way that we can hold it by way of a teleconference
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9001098275184631;but if we have a teleconference we cannot have a press conference
2000-06-08;2000;June;REPORT;Neutral;0.9545994997024536;that basically is the followup
