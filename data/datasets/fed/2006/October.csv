2006-10-25;2006;October;Minute;Positive;0.792779266834259;and strong growth in imports in july and august driven in part by a surge in oil imports suggested that net exports probably posed an arithmetic drag on economic growth in the third quarter
2006-10-25;2006;October;Minute;Positive;0.991166889667511;the ongoing adjustment in the housing market was likely to depress real activity in the near term but this effect was expected to wane gradually private final domestic purchases had held up well in recent months and looked set to expand at a reasonably good pace

2006-10-25;2006;October;Minute;Positive;0.9923809170722961;looking ahead a gradual reduction in the restraining effects of the contraction in residential investment and further solid gains in consumer and business spending were expected to lead to a pickup in gdp growth through 2007 and into 2008 these gains in spending were likely to be supported by past declines in energy prices and continued gains in payroll employment and labor income
