2016-11-02;2016;November;Minute;Negative;0.9951897859573364;among the factors cited were a persistent decline in the neutral federal funds rate and depressed term premiums likely owing to the elevated size of the federal reserves balance sheet as well as the reduced likelihood of high inflation relative to several decades ago
