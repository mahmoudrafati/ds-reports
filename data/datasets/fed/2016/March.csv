2016-03-16;2016;March;Minute;Negative;0.9917762279510498;members noted that inflation had picked up in recent months however they also noted that inflation had continued to run below the committees 2 percent longerrun objective partly reflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of nonenergy imports
2016-03-16;2016;March;Minute;Positive;0.9602399468421936;participants continued to anticipate that inflation would run below the committees 2 percent objective in the near term but that as the transitory effects of earlier declines in energy and import prices dissipated and the labor market strengthened further inflation would rise to 2 percent over the medium term
2016-03-16;2016;March;Minute;Negative;0.9929693341255188;several participants indicated that the persistence of global disinflationary pressures or the possibility that inflation expectations were moving lower continued to pose downside risks to the inflation outlook

2016-03-16;2016;March;Minute;Negative;0.975246250629425;several participants also argued for proceeding cautiously in reducing policy accommodation because they saw the risks to the us economy stemming from developments abroad as tilted to the downside or because they were concerned that longerterm inflation expectations might be slipping lower skewing the risks to the outlook for inflation to the downside
2016-03-16;2016;March;Minute;Negative;0.9358819127082825;many participants noted that with the target range for the federal funds rate only slightly above zero the fomc continued to have little room to ease monetary policy through conventional means if economic activity or inflation turned out to be materially weaker than anticipated but could raise rates quickly if the economy appeared to be overheating or if inflation was to increase significantly more rapidly than anticipated
2016-03-16;2016;March;Minute;Negative;0.7373429536819458;in their view this asymmetry made it prudent to wait for additional information regarding the underlying strength of economic activity and prospects for inflation before taking another step to reduce policy accommodation
2016-03-16;2016;March;Minute;Negative;0.983984112739563;for all of these reasons most participants judged it appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 14 to 12 percent at this meeting while noting that global economic and financial developments continued to pose risks
2016-03-16;2016;March;Minute;Positive;0.9866303205490112;a couple of participants however saw an increase in the target range to 12 to 34 percent as appropriate at this meeting citing evidence that the economy was continuing to expand at a moderate rate despite developments abroad and earlier volatility in financial conditions continued improvement in labor market conditions the firming of inflation over recent months and the apparent levelingoff of oil prices
2016-03-16;2016;March;Minute;Negative;0.990882933139801;in their judgment increasing the target range for the federal funds rate too gradually in the near term risked having to raise it quickly later which could cause economic and financial strains at that time
2016-03-16;2016;March;Minute;Negative;0.9579921960830688;many participants also noted that a somewhat lower projected interest rate path was one reason for the relatively small revisions in their mediumterm projections for economic activity unemployment and inflation

2016-03-16;2016;March;Minute;Negative;0.88173508644104;in light of this expectation and their assessment of the risks to the economic outlook several expressed the view that a cautious approach to raising rates would be prudent or noted their concern that raising the target range as soon as april would signal a sense of urgency they did not think appropriate
2016-03-16;2016;March;Minute;Neutral;0.5189580321311951;in contrast some other participants indicated that an increase in the target range at the committees next meeting might well be warranted if the incoming economic data remained consistent with their expectations for moderate growth in output further strengthening of the labor market and inflation rising to 2 percent over the medium term
2016-03-16;2016;March;Minute;Positive;0.8466055393218994;committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead members judged that information received since the committee met in january suggested that economic activity had been expanding at a moderate pace despite the global economic and financial developments of recent months
2016-03-16;2016;March;Minute;Negative;0.9869998097419739;a few others expressed the view that there were also risks that could lead to inflation running higher than anticipated for example overly tight resource utilization could push inflation above the committees 2 percent goal particularly if productivity gains remained sluggish
2016-03-16;2016;March;Minute;Negative;0.9943332672119141;they also agreed that household spending had been increasing at a moderate rate and that the housing sector had improved further however business fixed investment and net exports had been soft

2016-03-16;2016;March;Minute;Neutral;0.988284707069397;these participants saw their judgment as consistent with the committees datadependent approach to setting monetary policy it was noted that in this context the relevant data include not only domestic economic releases but also information about developments abroad and changes in financial conditions that bear on the economic outlook
2016-03-16;2016;March;Minute;Negative;0.9942384958267212;several participants also cited wider credit spreads as a factor that was likely to restrain growth in demand

2016-03-16;2016;March;Minute;Negative;0.9731364846229553;several participants noted that some of the softness in the marketbased measures likely reflected changes in risk and liquidity premiums and that some of the surveybased measures appeared to be excessively sensitive to movements in gasoline prices
2016-03-16;2016;March;Minute;Negative;0.9941098690032959;some participants concluded that longerrun inflation expectations remained reasonably stable but some others expressed concern that longerrun inflation expectations may have already moved lower or that they might do so if inflation was to persist for much longer at a rate below the committees objective
2016-03-16;2016;March;Minute;Negative;0.9897303581237793;many participants expressed a view that the global economic and financial situation still posed appreciable downside risks to the domestic economic outlook

2016-03-16;2016;March;Minute;Neutral;0.9878953695297241;participants discussed the implications of the global economic and financial developments of the past few months for the mediumterm outlook and they offered different characterizations of the risks to the us economy stemming from these developments
2016-03-16;2016;March;Minute;Negative;0.8705980181694031;nonetheless many participants indicated that the heightened global risks and the asymmetric ability of monetary policy to respond to them warranted caution in making adjustments to the stance of us monetary policy

2016-03-16;2016;March;Minute;Neutral;0.9871397614479065;taking these developments into account participants generally judged that the mediumterm outlook for domestic demand was not appreciably different than it had been when the committee met in december
2016-03-16;2016;March;Minute;Negative;0.9935152530670166;however most participants while recognizing the likely positive effects of recent policy actions abroad saw foreign economic growth as likely to run at a somewhat slower pace than previously expected a development that probably would further restrain growth in us exports and tend to damp overall aggregate demand
2016-03-16;2016;March;Minute;Positive;0.9850044250488281;in contrast a few noted that the actions taken by several foreign central banks in recent weeks to increase monetary accommodation likely had helped mitigate downside risks to the global outlook
