2014-03-19;2014;March;Minute;Negative;0.7787013053894043;however several participants noted that the increase in the median projection overstated the shift in the projections
2014-03-19;2014;March;Minute;Neutral;0.9533149600028992;several participants indicated that recent economic news although leading them to mark down somewhat their estimates of economic growth in late 2013 as well as their assessments of likely growth in the first quarter of 2014 had not prompted a significant revision of their projections of moderate economic growth over coming quarters
2014-03-19;2014;March;Minute;Neutral;0.9551982283592224;while there was general agreement that slack remains in the labor market participants expressed a range of views regarding the amount of slack and how well the unemployment rate performs as a summary indicator of labor market conditions
2014-03-19;2014;March;Minute;Negative;0.511265218257904;the staff viewed the extent of uncertainty around its march projections for real gdp growth and the unemployment rate as roughly in line with the average of the past 20 years
2014-03-19;2014;March;Minute;Negative;0.9852023720741272;a couple of other participants however saw reasons to believe that slack was more limited viewing the decline in the participation rate as primarily reflecting demographic trends with little role for cyclical factors and observing that broader measures of unemployment had registered declines in the past year that were comparable with the decline in the standard measure
2014-03-19;2014;March;Minute;Neutral;0.9655911922454834;a few participants suggested that new language along these lines could instead be introduced when the first increase in the federal funds rate had drawn closer or after the committee had further discussed the reasons for anticipating a relatively low federal funds rate during the period of policy firming
2014-03-19;2014;March;Minute;Negative;0.9826579689979553;several participants pointed to a number of factorsincluding the low labor force participation rate and the stillhigh rates of longerduration unemployment and of workers employed part time for economic reasonsas suggesting that there might be considerably more labor market slack than indicated by the unemployment rate alone
2014-03-19;2014;March;Minute;Negative;0.9921900629997253;in particular participants cited higher precautionary savings by us households following the financial crisis higher global levels of savings demographic changes slower growth in potential output and continued restraint on the availability of credit
2014-03-19;2014;March;Minute;Negative;0.9918442368507385;participants observed that a number of factors were likely to have contributed to a persistent decline in the level of interest rates consistent with attaining and maintaining the committees objectives
2014-03-19;2014;March;Minute;Neutral;0.9930933713912964;most participants also believed that as part of the process of clarifying the committees future policy intentions it would be appropriate at this time for the committee to provide additional guidance in its postmeeting statement regarding the likely behavior of the federal funds rate after its first increase
2014-03-19;2014;March;Minute;Neutral;0.9916089177131653;most participants therefore did not favor adding new quantitative language preferring to shift to qualitative language that would describe the committees likely reaction to the state of the economy
2014-03-19;2014;March;Minute;Negative;0.9860675930976868;other participants however judged that it was already well understood that the committee recognizes that inflation persistently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance
2014-03-19;2014;March;Minute;Neutral;0.9849338531494141;a few participants proposed adding new language in which the committee would indicate its willingness to keep rates low if projected inflation remained persistently below the committees 2 percent longerrun objective these participants suggested that the inclusion of this quantitative element in the forward guidance would demonstrate the committees commitment to defend its inflation objective from below as well as from above
2014-03-19;2014;March;Minute;Neutral;0.9931631088256836;another participant favored introducing new quantitative thresholds of 512 percent for the unemployment rate and 214 percent for projected inflation
2014-03-19;2014;March;Minute;Negative;0.9918579459190369;one participant however favored retaining the existing threshold language on the grounds that removing it before the unemployment rate reached 612 percent could be misinterpreted as a signal that the path of policy going forward would be less accommodative
2014-03-19;2014;March;Minute;Neutral;0.9935508966445923;most participants preferred replacing the numerical thresholds with a qualitative description of the factors that would influence the committees decision to begin raising the federal funds rate
2014-03-19;2014;March;Minute;Neutral;0.9858942031860352;almost all participants agreed that it was appropriate at this meeting to update the forward guidance in part because the unemployment rate was seen as likely to fall below its 612 percent threshold value before long
2014-03-19;2014;March;Minute;Neutral;0.9886963367462158;in their discussion of monetary policy going forward participants focused primarily on possible changes to the committees forward guidance for the federal funds rate

2014-03-19;2014;March;Minute;Neutral;0.6468528509140015;for example the statement could indicate that the committee currently anticipates that even after employment and inflation are near mandateconsistent levels economic conditions may for some time warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the committee views as normal in the longer run

2014-03-19;2014;March;Minute;Positive;0.9246982336044312;a number of participants noted that a pickup in nominal wage growth would be consistent with labor market conditions moving closer to normal and would support the return of consumer price inflation to the committees 2 percent longerrun goal
2014-03-19;2014;March;Minute;Negative;0.9931500554084778;however a couple of other participants suggested that factors other than economic slack had played a notable role in holding down inflation of late including unusually slow growth in prices of medical services
