2014-09-17;2014;September;Minute;Neutral;0.9900924563407898;however it was noted that the current formulation of the committees forward guidance clearly indicated that the committees policy decisions were conditional on its ongoing assessment of realized and expected progress toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation and that its assessment reflected its review of a broad array of economic indicators
2014-09-17;2014;September;Minute;Neutral;0.9931424856185913;it was emphasized that the current forward guidance for the federal funds rate was data dependent and did not indicate that the first increase in the target range for the federal funds rate would occur mechanically after some fixed calendar interval following the completion of the current asset purchase program

2014-09-17;2014;September;Minute;Neutral;0.6277308464050293;it was generally agreed that when changes to the forward guidance become appropriate they will likely present communication challenges and that caution will be needed to avoid sending unintended signals about the committees policy outlook

2014-09-17;2014;September;Minute;Neutral;0.927632749080658;two members however dissented because in their view the statement language did not accurately reflect the progress made to date toward the committees goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent and they believed that ongoing progress will likely warrant an earlier increase in the federal funds rate than suggested by the forward guidance in the committees postmeeting statement
2014-09-17;2014;September;Minute;Positive;0.9915122389793396;the staff still anticipated that the pace of real gdp growth in 2015 and 2016 would exceed the growth rate of potential output supported by continued increases in consumer and business confidence the further easing of the restraint on spending from changes in fiscal policy additional improvements in credit availability and a pickup in foreign economic growth
