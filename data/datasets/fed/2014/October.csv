2014-10-29;2014;October;Minute;Negative;0.9895054697990417;however one participant pointed to mixed retail sales reports that likely reflected a continuation of restrained discretionary spending on the part of low and middleincome households

2014-10-29;2014;October;Minute;Neutral;0.9512287974357605;all but one member agreed that the committee should reiterate the expectation that it likely would be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time following the end of the asset purchase program in october especially if projected inflation continued to run below the committees 2 percent longerrun goal and provided that longerterm inflation expectations remained well anchored
2014-10-29;2014;October;Minute;Negative;0.9923638105392456;it was observed that if foreign economic or financial conditions deteriorated further us economic growth over the medium term might be slower than currently expected

2014-10-29;2014;October;Minute;Neutral;0.9861578941345215;in the end the committee decided not to include such a reference
2014-10-29;2014;October;Minute;Negative;0.9896785020828247;on the other hand including a reference risked the possibility of suggesting greater concern on the part of the committee than was actually the case perhaps leading to the misimpression that monetary policy was likely to respond to increases in volatility
2014-10-29;2014;October;Minute;Positive;0.9851416349411011;on the one hand including a reference would show that the committee was monitoring financial developments while also providing an opportunity to note that financial conditions remained highly supportive of growth

2014-10-29;2014;October;Minute;Neutral;0.9780069589614868;however a couple of participants thought that the language should be amended in light of the prescriptions suggested by many monetary policy rules and the risks associated with keeping interest rates below their longerrun values for an extended period of time

2014-10-29;2014;October;Minute;Neutral;0.8781723380088806;by keeping the committees holdings of longerterm securities at sizable levels this policy was expected to help maintain accommodative financial conditions
2014-10-29;2014;October;Minute;Negative;0.8941347599029541;it was noted that communication about postliftoff policy would pose challenges given the inherent uncertainty of the economic and financial outlook and the committees desire to retain flexibility to adjust policy in response to the incoming data
