a summary of the economic and financial information available at the time of the meeting and of the committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was approved by the committee and issued to the federal reserve bank of new york.the information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the growth of economic activity slowed substantially in the third quarter, and the limited information available for the period since then indicated continued moderate expansion.;negative
a marked softening in the growth of consumer expenditures accounted for much of the slowing in the third quarter, but slight weakening in housing demand, net exports, and federal purchases of goods and services also exerted retarding effects.;negative
on the other hand, a sizable increase in inventory investment, greater strength in business demand for durable equipment, and an upturn in spending on nonresidential construction helped foster moderate further economic growth in the third quarter.;positive
employment posted sizable increases over the third quarter and rose substantially further in october, but on balance the gains were somewhat below those recorded earlier in the year.;positive
industrial production had weakened somewhat recently.;negative
consumer price inflation had picked up this year because of larger increases in food and energy prices.;positive
increases in labor compensation, though moderating in the third quarter, also had been somewhat larger this year.private nonfarm payroll employment increased considerably in october after a small rise in september private payroll growth had moderated on balance since midyear but nevertheless had remained substantial.;positive
in october, job gains were large in services industries construction employment registered another moderate gain and manufacturing payrolls edged up after a sizable september loss.;positive
the civilian unemployment rate in october was unchanged at 5.2 percent.industrial production appeared to have declined appreciably in october after having grown briskly on balance over earlier months of the year.;negative
much of the slackening in october was due to work stoppages in the motor vehicles industry, but the output of other industries also apparently decreased slightly on balance.;negative
the drop in production was accompanied by a slight decline in capacity utilization in manufacturing.total retail sales rose appreciably in september after having changed little on balance over july and august for the third quarter as a whole, total retail sales edged higher after having expanded briskly in the first half of the year.;positive
september sales totals were boosted by strong spending at automotive dealers, food stores, and nondurable goods outlets.;positive
however, expenditures for furniture, appliances and other non-auto durable goods fell, and apparel sales weakened a little further.;negative
housing starts declined in september from the unusually high level recorded in august and permits moved lower for a second straight month.;negative
home sales were mixed, with sales of new homes well sustained in september while those of existing homes continued on a downtrend.return to topgrowth of business fixed investment surged in the third quarter.;positive
outlays for durable equipment picked up sharply, and new orders for business equipment remained on an upward trend.;positive
sales of computers and communications equipment increased rapidly, but demand for other capital goods was up only slightly during the quarter.;positive
in the transportation sector, expenditures on motor vehicles and aircraft strengthened while sales of heavy trucks continued to drift lower.;negative
spending on nonresidential structures more than reversed a second- quarter decline however, incoming data on contracts pointed to a continuation of the pattern of somewhat slower growth recorded thus far in 1996.the pace of inventory investment picked up markedly after midyear, but inventory-sales ratios nonetheless remained relatively low.;negative
in manufacturing, inventories rose moderately in the third quarter, more than offsetting a small rundown in stocks in the previous quarter stock-shipments ratios for most industries remained near the low end of their recent ranges.;positive
in the wholesale sector, inventories declined sharply in september after having edged down in the previous two months, and the aggregate inventory-sales ratio for the sector fell to the low end of its range over recent years.;negative
at the retail level, substantial inventory accumulation occurred over the july-august period (latest data).;negative
although stock-sales ratios rose slightly, inventories remained relatively well aligned with sales.the nominal deficit on u.s. trade in goods and services narrowed somewhat in august from a high rate in july however, for the two months combined, the deficit was considerably wider than its average rate for the second quarter.;negative
exports declined appreciably over the july-august period, with most of the decrease occurring in nonmonetary gold and aircraft.;negative
imports rose only marginally on balance over the two months.;positive
the limited available information suggested that, on average, economic activity in the major foreign industrial countries expanded moderately in the third quarter.consumer price inflation had picked up on balance this year as a result of sizable increases in food and energy prices.;positive
over august and september, however, increases in food prices were offset by a net decline in energy prices, and overall consumer prices rose more moderately.;positive
for the twelve months ended in september, the advance in consumer prices of items other than food and energy was a little smaller than it had been over the previous twelve months.;negative
at the producer level, price inflation also was moderate over august and september despite appreciable increases in the prices of food and energy items producer prices of items other than food and energy rose considerably less over the twelve months ended in september than they had over the previous twelve months.;positive
growth in the employment cost index for private industry workers slowed considerably in the third quarter after having trended up over the first two quarters of the year however, this measure of labor compensation was up slightly over the twelve months ended in september compared with the previous twelve months.;negative
average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory workers were unchanged in october, but the twelve-month rise in this index through october was a bit larger than the increase over the previous twelve months.at its meeting on september 24, 1996, the committee adopted a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions but that included a bias toward the possible firming of reserve conditions during the intermeeting period.;positive
the directive stated that in the context of the committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable and slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period.;neutral
the reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with moderate growth of m2 and m3 over coming months.with incoming information continuing to suggest moderate economic growth and subdued price inflation, open market operations during the intermeeting period were directed toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and the federal funds rate generally remained close to the level expected with an unchanged policy stance.;positive
market participants had anticipated some tightening of monetary policy at the september 24 meeting, and the announcement of an unchanged policy led to an immediate decline in interest rates, with the larger decreases occurring at the shorter end of the yield curve.;negative
interest rates, especially those at intermediate and longer maturities, dropped further over the remainder of the period in response to information indicating that price and labor cost pressures were lower than market participants had expected.;negative
equity markets responded to the declines in interest rates as well as to favorable earnings reports, and most major indexes reached record highs.in foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other g-10 currencies depreciated slightly on balance over the intermeeting period.;positive
interest rates in the foreign industrial countries fell somewhat less on average than did u.s. interest rates.;negative
the dollar changed little against the german mark and most other major continental european currencies, but it rose against the yen as prospects for a significant supplemental budget package in japan waned in the aftermath of the recent elections in that country.;negative
the dollar declined against the pound sterling in response to the release of favorable data on the u.k. economy as well as an unexpected increase in the bank of england's minimum lending rate.m2 grew at a slower pace in september and october than it had over earlier months of the year the weaker expansion resulted from a continuing rapid runoff in its liquid deposit components.;negative
nonetheless, m2 was estimated to have grown for the year through october at a rate in the upper half of the committee's annual range.;positive
by contrast, m3 expanded at a substantially faster rate in september and october than it had earlier in the year, reflecting a surge in its large time deposit and other managed liability components to meet business demand for bank loans.;positive
for the year through october, m3 was estimated to have grown at a rate around the top of its annual range.;positive
total domestic nonfinancial debt had expanded moderately on balance over recent months and had remained in the middle portion of its range.return to topthe staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the expansion would continue at a rate close to, or perhaps a little above, the economy's estimated growth potential.;positive
consumer spending was projected to rebound in the current quarter and subsequently to expand at a moderate pace in line with the projected increase in disposable income the favorable effect on household wealth of the rise that had occurred in stock prices and the ample availability of credit for most borrowers were expected to balance continuing consumer concerns about the adequacy of their savings and the restraining effect of high household debt burdens.;positive
homebuilding was forecast to decline slightly further in response to the previous backup in residential mortgage rates but to stabilize at a relatively high level in the context of continued income growth and a generally favorable cash-flow affordability of home ownership.;negative
business spending on equipment and structures was projected to grow less rapidly in light of the anticipated moderate growth of sales and profits.;positive
on balance, the external sector was expected to exert a small restraining influence on economic activity over the projection period.;neutral
a slight degree of fiscal restraint was anticipated over the forecast horizon.;negative
continued pressure on resources, especially in labor markets, pointed to a likely underlying tendency toward higher inflation over the projection period however, it was expected that improved supply conditions in food and energy markets, as well as planned technical changes, would damp increases in the consumer price index relative to the elevated 1996 rate.in the committee's discussion, members commented that most recent developments bearing on the outlook for economic growth and inflation had been favorable.;positive
the information on economic activity since the september meeting had confirmed earlier indications of appreciable slowing in the expansion to a sustainable pace close to the economy's potential.;negative
the outlook remained subject, as usual, to considerable uncertainty, but many of the members observed that underlying trends in key sectors of the economy along with generally supportive financial conditions seemed consistent with further moderate economic expansion.;positive
in this regard, several focused on what they saw as the promising prospects for a rebound in the growth of consumer expenditures following weak expansion in the third quarter the pickup would help sustain moderate economic growth over the nearer term despite some anticipated retrenchment in inventory accumulation.;positive
with respect to the outlook for inflation, members emphasized that despite widespread indications of tight labor markets, the increase in wages had been muted and somewhat less than anticipated, and there was no broad evidence of rising price inflation.;negative
indeed, many major measures of inflation had exhibited a slight downtrend since 1993. looking ahead, views differed to some extent regarding the most likely course for inflation.;negative
several members indicated that, while recent developments were encouraging, they continued to see the risks as tilted toward some rise, even assuming that the expansion settled into a pattern of growth near the economy's potential as they anticipated and resource utilization remained near current levels other members felt that the risks surrounding the forecasts for both economic growth and price inflation had become more evenly balanced, but more evidence was needed before a firm judgment could be reached.in their review of developments in key sectors of the economy, members said that they anticipated a pickup in consumer spending from its much reduced rate of growth in the third quarter.;positive
while the factors relating to the prospects for consumer expenditures did not all point toward greater strength, members tended to focus on those favoring an upturn.;neutral
these included persisting growth in employment and incomes and clearly upbeat consumer sentiment as evidenced by recent surveys and anecdotal reports.;positive
financial factors also seemed likely on balance to accommodate continuing growth in consumer spending, in particular the marked increases that had occurred in the value of stock holdings and a still-ample availability of credit to most households.;positive
supporting evidence included anecdotal reports from retailers in a numbers of areas who were experiencing sizable gains in sales and seemed optimistic about the outlook for the upcoming holiday season.;positive
among the developments that would tend to limit growth in consumer spending, members emphasized the level of consumer indebtedness which had strained the liquidity of many households.;negative
the growth of consumer credit was now exhibiting a moderating trend, possibly pointing to restrained spending by many households because of already heavy debt service burdens and generally tightening credit standards for consumer loans.;negative
other negative factors cited in the outlook for consumer expenditures were the possibility of a correction in the stock market and the probable satisfaction of much of the earlier pent-up demand for consumer durables.;negative
in balancing these conflicting influences, the members generally concluded that a pickup in the growth of consumer spending to a moderate pace was a likely prospect for this critical sector of the economy.business fixed investment was expected to provide further but diminished impetus to the expansion.;positive
this view took account of the continued availability of debt and equity financing on favorable terms but also of expectations of a more moderate growth trend in sales and the substantial buildup that had already occurred in stocks of equipment and structures.;positive
with regard to the latter, some overbuilding of commercial and other structures characterized conditions in a number of areas.;neutral
nonetheless, members reported considerable nonresidential building activity in several parts of the country, and nationwide such activity was expected to help sustain modest growth in overall nonresidential construction in coming quarters.recent data, supported by anecdotal reports from several though not all parts of the country, suggested that residential building activity was slowing somewhat, apparently in lagged response to earlier increases in mortgage interest rates.;negative
however, in the context of the partial reversal recently of the previous increases in mortgage rates and sustained growth in employment and incomes, the housing sector was viewed as likely to exert only a minor constraint on overall economic activity over the forecast horizon.;positive
another somewhat negative factor in the outlook for economic activity was the prospect of some widening in the nation's trade deficit over the projection period.return to topfiscal policy currently remained on a mildly restrictive course, but the range of potential developments was especially wide, injecting an element of considerable uncertainty in the economic outlook.;negative
legislation affecting the federal budget could have marked beneficial or adverse effects not only directly on spending and incomes but also on business and consumer confidence and financial markets.the growth of nonfarm business inventories in the third quarter had exceeded earlier expectations, but members commented that the sizable rise appeared to have been largely voluntary and the overall level of inventories was still historically low in relation to sales.;negative
against this background, inventory accumulation was likely to continue but at a slower pace in the current quarter.;negative
beyond the near term, inventory investment was expected to become a more neutral factor in the performance of the economy, given the absence of incentives to build stocks relative to sales in a period of moderate growth in projected demand.;neutral
the members recognized, however, that the prospective behavior of inventories remained subject to substantial uncertainties.in their discussion of the outlook for inflation, members again focused on developments in labor markets and the extent to which rising cost pressures in those markets might be passed through to higher prices.;neutral
the statistical and anecdotal information generally continued to point to tight labor markets and to a somewhat faster rise in labor compensation costs this year.;positive
even so, the increases in such costs were still falling short of those that would have been anticipated on the basis of historical experience under similar labor market conditions.;negative
moreover, the advance in the overall employment cost index in the third quarter, while perhaps understated to some extent, was appreciably below expectations.;negative
at the same time, business firms generally were not raising their prices sufficiently to compensate for faster increases in their labor costs, to the extent that the latter were occurring, evidently because of the persistence of intense competition in most markets.;negative
indeed, with the notable exception of the overall consumer price index, the rate of inflation as measured by various broad price indexes had tended to ease marginally or at worst to stabilize over the past two years.;positive
prices of farm commodities and industrial materials had declined considerably recently.despite the recent encouraging reports on labor compensation and prices, the members agreed that the risks of rising inflation could not be dismissed and several continued to view slightly higher inflation as a likely if not inevitable prospect.;negative
much would depend, of course, on the strength of the economic expansion and the associated degree of pressure on resources, notably in labor markets which appeared to have comparatively little slack in relation to other producer resources.;neutral
it was suggested in this regard that restrained increases in labor compensation in comparison with historical experience probably were a transitory phenomenon, though one could not predict when a more normal relationship would re-emerge.;positive
a related concern was whether the tightness in labor markets would ease sufficiently and quickly enough to prevent inflation pressures from escalating significantly.;negative
some members mentioned a number of favorable factors in the outlook for inflation that tended to attenuate such concerns, such as reduced pressures on food prices as a result of better-than-expected harvests and improved supply conditions in markets for energy.;positive
relatively restrained monetary growth in recent months also was cited as a development consistent with subdued inflationary pressures.;positive
moreover, the view was advanced that recent developments in bond markets could be read as suggesting some decrease in inflationary expectations.;positive
on balance, while the members expressed varying degrees of concern that tight labor markets and attendant increases in wages might at some point lead to rising price inflation, they agreed that there was little or no evidence of such a development at this point and the outlook was far from certain.in the committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all the members indicated that they could support an unchanged policy stance and the retention of a bias toward restraint in the directive.;neutral
the slowing of the expansion to a sustainable pace near the economy's growth potential and the recent surprisingly favorable inflationary developments suggested lower risks of strengthening price pressures and provided the committee with a desirable opportunity to pause and observe further developments bearing on the course of economic activity and inflation.;positive
indeed, to the extent that inflation expectations had declined recently, short-term interest rates, which had changed little in nominal terms, had edged higher in real terms, implying slightly greater monetary restraint and reducing the odds that inflation would pick up.with regard to possible adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period, all the members indicated that they could support a proposal to retain the current bias toward restraint.;positive
several viewed such a bias as desirable because they continued to believe that the risks remained tilted, at least to some extent, toward rising inflation over time.;positive
in the circumstances an asymmetric directive would best reflect their views even if, as seemed likely, intermeeting developments did not prompt a policy tightening adjustment.;neutral
other members commented that a shift to a symmetric directive might be viewed as more consistent with the apparently diminished inflationary pressures.;positive
they agreed, however, that such a shift would be premature in the currently uncertain environment and might signal, inaccurately, that the federal reserve was less concerned about the possibility of a a modest upward trajectory in price inflation.return to topat the conclusion of the committee's discussion, all the members indicated that they supported a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and retaining a bias toward the possible firming of reserve conditions during the intermeeting period.;positive
accordingly, in the context of the committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the committee decided that somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable and slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period.;neutral
the reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with moderate growth of m2 and relatively strong expansion in m3 over coming months.the federal reserve bank of new york was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the committee, to execute transactions in the system account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:the information reviewed at this meeting suggests that growth in economic activity slowed substantially in the third quarter, and the limited available information indicates continued moderate expansion more recently.;neutral
private nonfarm payroll employment increased appreciably on balance over september and october.;positive
the civilian unemployment rate remained at 5.2 percent in october.;negative
industrial production, which continued to rise in the third quarter, appears to have declined in october owing in important measure to work stoppages in the motor vehicles industry.;negative
total retail sales turned up in september after slumping earlier in the summer.;positive
housing starts fell in september from the exceptionally high level registered in august.;negative
outlays for business equipment were strong in the third quarter and new orders continued to trend upward business spending on nonresidential structures posted a moderate advance.;positive
inventory investment was substantial in the third quarter, but inventory-sales ratios remained relatively low.;negative
the nominal deficit on u.s. trade in goods and services widened considerably in july-august from its average rate in the second quarter.;positive
increases in labor compensation, though moderating in the third quarter, have trended up this year consumer price inflation also has picked up this year, owing to larger increases in food and energy prices.market interest rates have moved lower since the committee meeting on september 24, 1996, with the largest declines occurring in intermediate- and long-term maturities.;negative
in foreign exchange markets, the trade- weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other g-10 currencies has depreciated slightly over the intermeeting period.growth of m2 in september and october remained below its pace in the first half of the year, while expansion of m3 was substantially higher over those two months.;negative
for the year through october, m2 is estimated to have grown at a rate in the upper half of the committee's annual range, and m3 at a rate around the top of its range.;positive
expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt has been moderate on balance over recent months and has remained in the middle portion of its range.the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.;positive
in furtherance of these objectives, the committee at its meeting in july reaffirmed the ranges it had established in january for growth of m2 and m3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996. the monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 3 to 7 percent for the year.;neutral
for 1997 the committee agreed on a tentative basis to set the same ranges as in 1996 for growth of the monetary aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1996 to the fourth quarter of 1997. the behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.in the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions.;neutral
in the context of the committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve restraint would or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable in the intermeeting period.;neutral
the contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with moderate growth in m2 and relatively strong expansion in m3 over coming months.votes for this action:messrs. greenspan, mcdonough, boehne, jordan, kelley, lindsey, mcteer, meyer, mses.;positive
