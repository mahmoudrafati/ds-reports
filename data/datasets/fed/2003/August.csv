2003-08-12;2003;August;Minute;Negative;0.6261898875236511;while the committee could not commit itself to a particular policy course over time many of the members referred to the likelihood that the committee would want to keep policy accommodative for a longer period than had been the practice in past periods of accelerating economic activity
2003-08-12;2003;August;Minute;Negative;0.8528785705566406;reasons for such an approach to policy stemmed from the need to encourage progress toward closing the economys currently wide output gap and with inflation already near the low end of what some members regarded as an acceptable range to resist significant further disinflation
2003-08-12;2003;August;Minute;Negative;0.9835978150367737;in the view of these members appreciable added disinflation would potentially blunt the effectiveness of further policy easing in the event of strong adverse shocks to the economy
2003-08-12;2003;August;Minute;Negative;0.9035239219665527;at the same time maintaining an accommodative policy stance was seen as involving little risk of inducing rising inflation so long as high levels of excess capacity and very competitive markets continued to characterize economic conditions

2003-08-12;2003;August;Minute;Positive;0.7222287654876709;the potential for such a development constituted a sizable upside risk to current economic forecasts for the quarters ahead
2003-08-12;2003;August;Minute;Neutral;0.9907221794128418;several members commented that the nature of the committees communications had evolved substantially over recent meetings and that it might be useful to schedule a separate session to review current practices
2003-08-12;2003;August;Minute;Negative;0.9418125748634338;however cautious inventory policies generally had reduced stocks to very low levels in relation to growing sales and members saw inventory accumulation starting perhaps late this year as a plausible expectation
2003-08-12;2003;August;Minute;Negative;0.9303026795387268;indeed in the view of some members a normal cyclical swing in the accumulation of inventories that would bring the latter into a more usual alignment with growing sales could begin relatively soon and might well be markedly more pronounced than many now anticipated

2003-08-12;2003;August;Minute;Negative;0.9905941486358643;given the substantial ongoing slack in resource utilization some downward pressure on core price inflation was considered a risk in the staff forecast

2003-08-12;2003;August;Minute;Negative;0.6971752643585205;concerning the prospects for inflation members expressed the view that even if growth somewhat above the economys potential were to materialize over the next several quarters which many regarded as a likely scenario substantial excess margins of labor and other resources would remain and would continue to hold down overall inflation
2003-08-12;2003;August;Minute;Negative;0.9603583216667175;indeed a number of members saw merit in the staff forecast that some further disinflation was a likely prospect in such circumstances
