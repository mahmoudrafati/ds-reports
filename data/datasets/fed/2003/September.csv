2003-09-15;2003;September;Minute;Negative;0.8528785705566406;reasons for such an approach to policy stemmed from the need to encourage progress toward closing the economys currently wide output gap and with inflation already near the low end of what some members regarded as an acceptable range to resist significant further disinflation

2003-09-15;2003;September;Minute;Positive;0.9918152689933777;as a consequence improving sales and profits low financing costs and the temporary federal tax incentive for investment in new equipment and software were expected to boost business investment spending gradually
2003-09-15;2003;September;Minute;Negative;0.9905941486358643;given the substantial ongoing slack in resource utilization some downward pressure on core price inflation was considered a risk in the staff forecast

2003-09-15;2003;September;Minute;Negative;0.6971752643585205;concerning the prospects for inflation members expressed the view that even if growth somewhat above the economys potential were to materialize over the next several quarters which many regarded as a likely scenario substantial excess margins of labor and other resources would remain and would continue to hold down overall inflation
2003-09-15;2003;September;Minute;Negative;0.9603583216667175;indeed a number of members saw merit in the staff forecast that some further disinflation was a likely prospect in such circumstances
2003-09-15;2003;September;Minute;Positive;0.9926570057868958;members commented that current financial conditions remained a positive factor in the outlook for the economy even after the recent rise in longterm interest rates

2003-09-15;2003;September;Minute;Negative;0.9931538105010986;indeed mortgage refinancing activity appeared to have declined substantially according to some reports prospectively lessening the support for some consumer and other spending fostered by the extraction of equity from housing

2003-09-16;2003;September;Minute;Neutral;0.9785787463188171;to date businesses had displayed only limited signs of undertaking any investments other than for replacement and costcutting purposes
2003-09-16;2003;September;Minute;Negative;0.993058443069458;on the constraining side were the persistence of high levels of excess capacity and significant business uncertainty and caution regarding the extent and durability of the acceleration in final sales
2003-09-16;2003;September;Minute;Positive;0.8953595757484436;these included an appreciable acceleration in final sales since the first quarter sizable increases in business profits and cash flow this year the ready availability of business financing on attractive terms and the temporarily accelerated expensing provision in the tax code
2003-09-16;2003;September;Minute;Positive;0.9862204790115356;looking beyond the near term members mentioned a number of developments that supported an optimistic outlook for capital expenditures
2003-09-16;2003;September;Minute;Positive;0.9851560592651367;in this regard the secondquarter increase in expenditures for equipment and software was an encouraging sign and the available evidence pointed to a larger advance in the third quarter
2003-09-16;2003;September;Minute;Negative;0.9689592719078064;business fixed investment remained a critical factor and also a major source of uncertainty in the outlook for overall economic activity with the strength of such investment having a key bearing on the pace of the overall expansion
2003-09-16;2003;September;Minute;Positive;0.9895183444023132;even so the recent firming of orders and shipments along with somewhat more upbeat anecdotal reports and surveys of business spending plans pointed to a relatively brisk further advance in business spending for equipment and software at least over the near term
2003-09-16;2003;September;Minute;Positive;0.9922021627426147;the runup in mortgage rates since the latter part of june was expected to curb housing demand to a limited extent in coming months but the outlook for housing activity remained favorable given an overall economic performance in line with current forecasts of a robust expansion related growth in incomes and still relatively attractive mortgage interest rates
2003-09-16;2003;September;Minute;Negative;0.9920759201049805;a potential negative in this outlook was the possibility that weakness in employment if it continued would at some point exert a more pronounced negative effect on consumer sentiment
2003-09-16;2003;September;Minute;Positive;0.9913433790206909;some softening in motor vehicle sales from the exceptional pace in recent months seemed likely but overall consumer spending probably would be sustained at a high level by further anticipated gains in disposable incomes bolstered by the stimulus from recent federal tax cuts
2003-09-16;2003;September;Minute;Positive;0.9888017177581787;in their comments about prospective developments in the major components of aggregate demand members anticipated that the household sector would remain the mainstay of the expansion and that it would be significantly reinforced going forward by an acceleration in business expenditures and at least over the next several quarters by substantial further increases in federal government spending
2003-09-16;2003;September;Minute;Positive;0.98945552110672;in general financial markets were viewed as well positioned to support more vigorous expansion in economic activity
2003-09-16;2003;September;Minute;Negative;0.9881278872489929;members anticipated however that such business attitudes would give way to optimism at some point possibly quite suddenly as uncertainties relating to the outlook for final demand were replaced by concerns about missing profit opportunities in a strengthening expansion
2003-09-16;2003;September;Minute;Neutral;0.9888268709182739;the members agreed that inflation was likely to remain subdued for an extended period given current forecasts of economic activity and labor productivity trends
2003-09-16;2003;September;Minute;Positive;0.9886815547943115;in the housing area residential sales and construction stayed at elevated levels during the summer months with at least some portion of the strength reportedly stemming from efforts by many homebuyers to move ahead of further increases in mortgage interest rates
2003-09-16;2003;September;Minute;Positive;0.7844692468643188;nonresidential construction activity remained at a generally depressed level but appeared to have bottomed out with signs of an upturn in new or planned construction in some areas
2003-09-16;2003;September;Minute;Positive;0.9922522902488708;comments by many contacts in the banking sector were already quite upbeat with regard to the outlook for business spending and optimism in financial markets clearly had been improving for several months
2003-09-16;2003;September;Minute;Negative;0.9818082451820374;pointing to anticipated strength in inventory accumulation was the substantial drawdown in stocks that had occurred as final sales picked up this year a marked resulting drop in inventorysales ratios and expectations of accelerating final demand
2003-09-16;2003;September;Minute;Positive;0.9903994202613831;increasing business inventory expenditures to accommodate strengthening final sales were seen as a likely positive factor in the expansion of overall economic activity in coming quarters though the degree and timing of the impetus from a prospective buildup in inventories were subject to considerable uncertainty
2003-09-16;2003;September;Minute;Positive;0.9892983436584473;in their comments about the outlook for the foreign sector of the economy members referred to indications of some overall improvement in foreign economic activity which augured well for the growth in exports
2003-09-16;2003;September;Minute;Positive;0.9680309891700745;some members reported however that tax receipts recently had improved noticeably in a number of states
2003-09-16;2003;September;Minute;Negative;0.6921910643577576;the fiscal condition of many state and local governments remained severely stressed and ongoing efforts by these governments to curb spending and increase tax and other revenues provided a partial offset to the federal sector stimulus
2003-09-16;2003;September;Minute;Negative;0.9943019151687622;members commented that the current degree of fiscal stimulus was at its highest level since the world war ii period and some expressed concern in this regard that little legislative consideration was being given to reapplying fiscal restraint as changing economic conditions would warrant over time
2003-09-16;2003;September;Minute;Positive;0.9375549554824829;it was not clear at this point to what extent the partial expensing provision was boosting business investment in equipment and software but the high level of consumer spending clearly was playing a role in fostering such investment
2003-09-16;2003;September;Minute;Neutral;0.863856315612793;they also noted that the prospective performance of foreign economies would depend to a significant extent on the strength of the us economy
2003-09-16;2003;September;Minute;Neutral;0.5791182518005371;fiscal policy was likely to remain a key source of stimulus to the expansion
2003-09-16;2003;September;Minute;Negative;0.9942141175270081;at the same time however the persistence of business uncertainty and related caution were with some exceptions continuing to inhibit inventory investment
2003-09-16;2003;September;Minute;Positive;0.9903919696807861;federal spending was expected to increase substantially further albeit at a diminishing pace over the next year and beyond and reduced taxes should buoy both consumer and business expenditures
2003-09-16;2003;September;Minute;Positive;0.9893513321876526;moreover the trend toward improved communication and delivery systems was encouraging business firms to hold inventories at increasingly low levels in relation to expected sales
2003-09-16;2003;September;Minute;Negative;0.9907208681106567;with the latter displaying relative vigor the value of domestic imports was likely to continue to exceed that of exports by a substantial margin thereby tending to perpetuate the large current account deficits that had worrisome implications for the future
2003-09-16;2003;September;Minute;Negative;0.9890831708908081;against this background it seemed unlikely that businesses would seek to rebuild their inventories sufficiently to restore earlier inventorysales ratios
2003-09-16;2003;September;Minute;Positive;0.9911274313926697;even so further increases in sales would eventually lead to improved business confidence and induce efforts to accumulate inventories though probably to a lesser extent than had occurred in earlier cyclical recoveries
2003-09-16;2003;September;Minute;Neutral;0.859395444393158;according to anecdotal reports even service firms were now increasingly adopting advanced management techniques to hold down their inventories of items used in the process of providing their services
