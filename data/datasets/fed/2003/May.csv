2003-05-06;2003;May;Minute;Positive;0.9901177287101746;the successful prosecution of the war had served to reduce geopolitical uncertainties and in turn had helped to foster a marked strengthening of domestic financial markets a sizable decline in oil prices and an apparent upturn in consumer confidence
