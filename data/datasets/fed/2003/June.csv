2003-06-25;2003;June;Minute;Neutral;0.9841513633728027;beyond that a variety of nonconventional measures for further easing was available
2003-06-25;2003;June;Minute;Neutral;0.9094387292861938;an environment involving such interest rates could have adverse repercussions on the functioning of some sectors of the money market but the members agreed that the potential extent of such disruptions would not be sufficient to prevent the committee from taking advantage of the full scope of conventional easing of the federal funds rate should that become necessary

2003-06-25;2003;June;Minute;Neutral;0.8293251395225525;at least part of the acceleration was due to special factors related to strong mortgage refinancing activity and to the flow of funds associated with tax payments
2003-06-25;2003;June;Minute;Neutral;0.7215024828910828;some members noted that at the may meeting they had contemplated the need for an easing action at this meeting unless compelling evidence developed in the interim that the hopedfor acceleration in economic activity was clearly under way
2003-06-25;2003;June;Minute;Positive;0.8425453901290894;in the circumstances and given currently large margins of unemployed labor and other resources the members agreed that an easing move was desirable to provide additional insurance that a stronger economy would in fact materialize

2003-06-25;2003;June;Minute;Negative;0.7176663279533386;more importantly however the outlook for a strengthening expansion which might well materialize in the near future should limit any further disinflationary trend

2003-06-25;2003;June;Minute;Negative;0.9882829785346985;however in the view of at least some members recent developments had reduced the unwelcome prospect of substantial additional disinflation
2003-06-25;2003;June;Minute;Neutral;0.8955941796302795;the incoming information since the may meeting while mildly encouraging did not provide compelling evidence to warrant forestalling an easing action
2003-06-25;2003;June;Minute;Negative;0.9951397180557251;in this regard there was concern that inflation could be approaching a level that would begin to complicate the implementation of monetary policy if economic weakness unexpectedly persisted or the economy was subjected to another negative demand shock

2003-06-25;2003;June;Minute;Negative;0.9942017197608948;however downward revisions to foreign growth forecasts for the balance of this year implied continuing restraint on the expansion in foreign demand for us goods and services
2003-06-25;2003;June;Minute;Positive;0.9788895845413208;although current growth in demand from abroad was being held down by the relatively sluggish economies of major us trading partners the weaker dollar was expected to foster somewhat faster expansion in us exports

2003-06-25;2003;June;Minute;Positive;0.9901543259620667;the strong performance of the housing industry continued to be attributed in large measure to the lowest mortgage interest rates in several decades
2003-06-25;2003;June;Minute;Positive;0.9911187291145325;the members continued to report a high level of housing demand in numerous parts of the country with housing construction described as a notably robust sector in many regional economies
2003-06-25;2003;June;Minute;Negative;0.9757988452911377;with the economy thought likely to continue to operate below its potential for an extended period and productivity growth expected to remain robust the members believed that the current lowinflation environment would persist over the next several quarters and indeed that some further disinflation could be in store
2003-06-25;2003;June;Minute;Positive;0.9883572459220886;on balance while they acknowledged the risks of a weaker outcome the members generally expected the consumer sector to play a key role in their forecasts of a significantly strengthening expansion
2003-06-25;2003;June;Minute;Neutral;0.4890533685684204;members saw virtually no prospect that the proposed easing though it would reinforce an already accommodative monetary policy would incur any significant risk of contributing to rising inflationary pressures even if the strengthening of the economy proved to be somewhat greater than they had incorporated in their forecasts
2003-06-25;2003;June;Minute;Negative;0.9918761253356934;in this regard further disinflation seemed likely to be a more significant concern than rising inflation for a considerable period of time

2003-06-25;2003;June;Minute;Negative;0.8089447021484375;the vote encompassed the following statement whose substance would be included in the press release to be made available shortly after the meeting the risks to the committees outlook for sustainable economic growth over the next several quarters are balanced the risks to its outlook for inflation over the next several quarters are weighted toward the downside and taken together the balance of risks to its objectives is weighted toward the downside in the foreseeable future
2003-06-25;2003;June;Minute;Neutral;0.9605190753936768;to further its longrun objectives the committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with reducing the federal funds rate to an average of around 1 percent

2003-06-25;2003;June;Minute;Neutral;0.6743997931480408;during the discussion several members also stressed the importance of communicating clearly the reasons for the committees decisions thereby helping to assure the success of the committees policymaking efforts
2003-06-25;2003;June;Minute;Neutral;0.9702343344688416;the members also endorsed a general statement stating that taken together the balance of risks to the committees dual goals was tilted toward the downside for the foreseeable future
2003-06-25;2003;June;Minute;Neutral;0.9868822693824768;with regard to the committees assessment of the risks to be incorporated in the press release the members generally agreed that the risks to the goal of sustainable economic growth were about balanced for the next few quarters and that the probability of appreciable further disinflation from an already low level of inflation exceeded the probability of a rise in inflation
2003-06-25;2003;June;Minute;Neutral;0.4346831738948822;indeed the proposed reduction in the nominal federal funds rate would about offset the apparent increase in the real federal funds rate stemming from a recent decline in inflation

2003-06-25;2003;June;Minute;Positive;0.7427700757980347;the case for a larger 50 basis point reduction in the target federal funds rate focused on the desirability of a relatively forceful policy move that would be more likely to promote a strengthening economic expansion and at the same time provide greater assurance of countering any significant disinflation
2003-06-25;2003;June;Minute;Neutral;0.8058468103408813;moreover a 50 basis point reduction that was associated with the communication of a committee view that the risks to achieving its objectives for economic activity were balanced might be mistakenly interpreted in the view of some members as a signal that the committee had come to the end of its policy easing movesa judgment they were not prepared to make at this time
2003-06-25;2003;June;Minute;Negative;0.9795936346054077;however some members commented that a larger reduction might be misread as an indication of more concern among policymakers about the economic outlook than was in fact the case
2003-06-25;2003;June;Minute;Negative;0.89887934923172;no member expressed the opinion that a smaller move should be favored because of concerns about dislocations resulting from a very low level of the overnight interest rate
2003-06-25;2003;June;Minute;Positive;0.9704538583755493;views cited in favor of the ï½ percentage point easing included the emergence of firmer signs of a possible upturn in economic activity the nearterm prospect of substantial added fiscal stimulus and an already very accommodative stance of monetary policy
