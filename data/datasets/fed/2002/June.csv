2002-06-26;2002;June;Minute;Negative;0.9910981059074402;moreover forecasts of even moderate growth in spending were subject to downside risks emanating for example from possible further shocks to confidence and household wealth should weakness in stock prices persist and from political turmoil overseas and threats of terrorism at home

2002-06-26;2002;June;Minute;Negative;0.9939780235290527;a pickup in business spending was viewed as a key to sustained solid growth and questions about the timing and strength of such a pickup was a major source of uncertainty about the pace of the expansion in coming quarters
2002-06-26;2002;June;Minute;Positive;0.9800131916999817;the preconditions for a robust advance in investment spending appeared to be largely in place including the evident progress over the past several quarters in adjusting capital stocks to desired levels the temporary tax incentive and the need for competitive reasons to take advantage of the availability of increasingly productive equipment
2002-06-26;2002;June;Minute;Positive;0.9218268990516663;in fact recent orders and shipments data suggested an upturn in spending for new equipment but the improvement was still quite limited unevenly distributed across industries and not yet firmly indicative of a sustained advance
2002-06-26;2002;June;Minute;Positive;0.9312092065811157;in that regard consumer spending was seen as likely to provide some continuing though moderate impetus to the growth of the economy
2002-06-26;2002;June;Minute;Negative;0.9258561134338379;indeed the drop in such construction did not appear to have run its course for the nation as a whole
2002-06-26;2002;June;Minute;Negative;0.9432430863380432;while the members expected further gains in spending on equipment they continued to report widespread pessimism among their business contacts though exceptions had begun to emerge and the persistence of a high degree of caution that was leading business executives to defer numerous investment projects until they saw more conclusive evidence of stronger sales and profits
2002-06-26;2002;June;Minute;Negative;0.9869931936264038;at the same time however severe problems being experienced by a number of large countries in south america raised the specter of a deepening financial crisis within that region and the possibility of more widespread contagion

2002-06-26;2002;June;Minute;Neutral;0.8059766888618469;to the extent that the depreciation of the dollar was not reversed or that it continued it would of course tend to boost net exports
2002-06-26;2002;June;Minute;Neutral;0.9368394017219543;the factors that governed the exchange value of the dollar were complex and historically forecasts of trends in exchange rates had not been reliable
2002-06-26;2002;June;Minute;Negative;0.9930039048194885;with regard to the outlook for the external sector of the economy the sizable decline in the foreign exchange value of the dollar since the start of the year had given rise to market forecasts of appreciable further depreciation
2002-06-26;2002;June;Minute;Negative;0.678656280040741;given their anticipation of strong productivity growth and continuing slack in labor and other markets members expected inflation to remain low over the next several quarters

2002-06-26;2002;June;Minute;Positive;0.6822391748428345;for the economy as a whole the liquidation of business inventories appeared to be near completion in the current quarter and some rebuilding in association with forecasts of moderate expansion in sales seemed a likely prospect for coming quarters
2002-06-26;2002;June;Minute;Negative;0.9931245446205139;concurrently however at the state and local government level where budget flexibility was more limited sizable budgetary shortfalls likely would hold down expenditures and induce some tax increases with restraining effects over a period of time
2002-06-26;2002;June;Minute;Positive;0.8238956332206726;even so the ongoing adjustment of nonresidential capacity to demand had been substantial in recent quarters and likely would give way to a modest recovery during the year ahead
