2002-03-19;2002;March;Minute;Positive;0.754651665687561;the manufacturing sector where much of the economys weakness had been concentrated was displaying increased signs of stabilizing with activity actually picking up in a number of industries and some firms anticipating increases in their payrolls over the next several months after experiencing large declines

2002-03-19;2002;March;Minute;Positive;0.9807847738265991;a further strengthening of inventory investment would probably generate appreciable further growth in business activity over the quarters just ahead
2002-03-19;2002;March;Minute;Neutral;0.738648533821106;on balance a substantial pickup in overall capital spending seemed likely to be delayed in the absence of surprising strength in final demand but a wide range of possible outcomes could not be ruled out for this key sector of the economy
2002-03-19;2002;March;Minute;Negative;0.9522188305854797;in this regard it was noted that the economy was undergoing significant structural changes and those changes were adding to the usual difficulty of projecting the trajectory of economic activity after a turning point

2002-03-19;2002;March;Minute;Positive;0.9090648889541626;unexpected strength in household expenditures much reduced weakness in business capital spending and substantial slowing in inventory liquidation had produced an earlier upturn in economic activity than many had anticipated
2002-03-19;2002;March;Minute;Negative;0.9925541281700134;a major uncertainty in the economic outlook was the extent to which growth in final demand by households and business firms would provide ongoing support for the expansion as the impetus from inventory investment dissipated

2002-03-19;2002;March;Minute;Negative;0.9923377633094788;importantly because consumer spending for automobiles and other consumer durables had been well maintained through the extended period of economic weakness further gains in such expenditures were likely to be limited over coming quarters in contrast to the typical surge in past economic recoveries
2002-03-19;2002;March;Minute;Negative;0.9933100938796997;members nonetheless cited some negatives in the outlook for consumer spending including the possibilities that a negative stock market wealth effect stemming from large earlier declines and the somewhat elevated rate of unemployment would weigh on consumer confidence
