2002-09-24;2002;September;Minute;Neutral;0.9908435344696045;rather consistent with its usual practice the committee would assess the implications of any such development for the domestic economy before deciding on an action
2002-09-24;2002;September;Minute;Positive;0.9909123182296753;indeed if the geopolitical uncertainties were to ease significantly along with what already were apparently diminishing concerns about corporate governance issues the resulting improvement in business and consumer sentiment could generate a more robust economic expansion

2002-09-24;2002;September;Minute;Positive;0.9444429278373718;much of the strength of the aggregates liquid components likely was associated with the continuing historically low opportunity costs of holding such deposits the recent surge in mortgage refinancing activity and the safe haven provided from volatile equity prices

2002-09-24;2002;September;Minute;Negative;0.9838480353355408;business firms appeared to be in the process of moving from inventory liquidation to accumulation and the available evidence suggested that inventory positions were getting tighter
2002-09-24;2002;September;Minute;Positive;0.9923685193061829;the considerable monetary ease and fiscal stimulus already in place continuing gains in structural productivity and improving business confidence would provide significant impetus for spending

2002-09-24;2002;September;Minute;Positive;0.9925031661987305;as a consequence a gradually improving outlook for sales and profits low financing costs and the temporary federal tax incentive for investment in new equipment and software were expected to boost business investment spending
2002-09-24;2002;September;Minute;Negative;0.9907874464988708;however a less robust pickup in final sales was now expected over the forecast period which would put somewhat less pressure on resource margins than had been anticipated previously and the level of activity would remain below that of the economys potential for a longer time
2002-09-24;2002;September;Minute;Negative;0.9681835770606995;the persistence of underutilized resources was expected to foster some moderation in core price inflation

2002-09-24;2002;September;Minute;Positive;0.8640410304069519;the staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that in light of weakerthanexpected incoming economic data the expansion of economic activity would pick up more gradually but would still reach a relatively brisk pace late next year
2002-09-24;2002;September;Minute;Positive;0.9908350706100464;even so the economy appeared to be well positioned for solid gains over time in light of the progress that had been made in bringing inventories and capital stocks into better alignment with sales the stimulus provided by accommodative fiscal and monetary policies and the implications of the strong uptrend in productivity for profitable investment opportunities and growth in consumer incomes
2002-09-24;2002;September;Minute;Negative;0.9842259287834167;with the growth of economic activity nonetheless expected to remain below the economys potential for some time pressures on labor and other resources would be limited and in turn wage and price increases likely would continue to edge lower

2002-09-24;2002;September;Minute;Negative;0.9213330149650574;the value of homes had continued to rise in most areas and unusually low interest rates were inducing people to refinance mortgages and in the process to extract and spend some of the embedded equity gains
2002-09-24;2002;September;Minute;Negative;0.994411051273346;for now a high degree of business caution in the context of substantial uncertainties exacerbated recently by apparently increased concerns about the geopolitical outlook continued to restrain business investment and hiring
2002-09-24;2002;September;Minute;Positive;0.9887985587120056;increasing home equity values probably were also providing some counterweight to the impact on consumer spending of the negative wealth effects associated with the declines in stock market prices since the spring of 2000 other positive factors cited as helping to undergird the persisting strength in consumer spending included reductions in federal income tax rates the availability of financing for consumer durable goods at relatively attractive interest rates including zero interest rates for selected motor vehicles and the cumulative effects of productivity gains on current and expected real consumer incomes
2002-09-24;2002;September;Minute;Neutral;0.661673903465271;much of the current spending for equipment and software reportedly represented replacement demand largely associated with the short useful lives of various types of equipment and there appeared to be little spending that would entail capital deepening
