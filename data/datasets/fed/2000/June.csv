2000-06-28;2000;June;Statement;Negative;0.6227295398712158;although core measures of prices are rising slightly faster than a year ago continuing rapid advances in productivity have been containing costs and holding down underlying price pressures
2000-06-28;2000;June;Statement;Negative;0.9716274738311768;nonetheless signs that growth in demand is moving to a sustainable pace are still tentative and preliminary and the utilization of the pool of available workers remains at an unusually high level
2000-06-28;2000;June;Minute;Negative;0.9885755181312561;the expansion of domestic final demand increasingly would be held back by the anticipated waning of positive wealth effects associated with earlier large gains in equity prices and by higher interest rates as a result growth of spending on consumer durables and houses was expected to slow further
2000-06-28;2000;June;Minute;Negative;0.6128518581390381;in this view labor markets were already operating at levels of utilization that were likely eventually to produce rising labor costs that would be passed through to market prices even if productivity growth remained high or rose somewhat further
2000-06-28;2000;June;Minute;Negative;0.9949148893356323;looking beyond the near term a number of members noting that core measures of consumer prices had been rising more rapidly this year were concerned that these prices might well continue to accelerate gradually even assuming that economic expansion would be sustained at a pace close to the economys potential
2000-06-28;2000;June;Minute;Negative;0.9008689522743225;members generally saw little risk in deferring any further policy tightening move particularly since the possibility that underlying inflation would worsen appreciably seemed remote under prevailing circumstances

2000-06-28;2000;June;Minute;Positive;0.8319037556648254;a number of factors supported a projection of considerably more moderate expansion going forward in relation to the overly rapid pace in the second half of 1999 and early 2000 including the likelihood that much of the effect on spending of the rise in interest rates and leveling out in equity prices this year had not yet been felt
2000-06-28;2000;June;Minute;Negative;0.9934520721435547;nevertheless the indications of slowing economic expansion were still tentative

2000-06-28;2000;June;Minute;Neutral;0.9754287004470825;with regard to inflation members observed that steep increases in energy prices had boosted overall rates of inflation somewhat and in addition the higher energy prices likely had contributed indirectly to the rise in core measures of inflation
2000-06-28;2000;June;Minute;Negative;0.9903073310852051;a number of members also were concerned that rising core inflation could be generated increasingly from unsustainably tight labor markets and they noted that labor costs would need to be monitored closely even if growth in demand slowed sufficiently to keep levels of resource utilization about unchanged
2000-06-28;2000;June;Minute;Negative;0.9849676489830017;to date however rising productivity growth had contained labor cost pressures and despite the moderation in the expansion of activity there were no early signs of any slowing in the growth of productivity

2000-06-28;2000;June;Minute;Negative;0.9937757253646851;this slowing and the cumulative effects of the firming in financial conditions this year had been accompanied by an increasing number of anecdotal reports of more cautious business sentiment
2000-06-28;2000;June;Minute;Negative;0.9936301112174988;in their comments on developments in key sectors of the economy nationwide the members reported on statistical and anecdotal indications that growth in consumer spending had slowed appreciably in recent months from the unusually robust pace seen in late 1999 and early this year
2000-06-28;2000;June;Minute;Negative;0.8401517868041992;a number of factors that might account for the moderation could also point to the possible extension of the less robust trend
2000-06-28;2000;June;Minute;Negative;0.9875045418739319;those factors included gradually waning wealth effects associated with the absence of further large gains in stock market prices rising levels of consumer debt the loss of consumer purchasing power stemming from higher energy prices and the large cumulative buildup of consumer stocks of motor vehicles and other durables
2000-06-28;2000;June;Minute;Negative;0.34500256180763245;core price inflation was projected to rise noticeably over the forecast horizon partly as a result of higher import prices and some firming of gains in nominal labor compensation in persistently tight labor markets that would not be fully offset by productivity growth
2000-06-28;2000;June;Minute;Negative;0.9898622035980225;still the data on retail sales were volatile and often revised significantly some of the recent moderation in spending might have reflected a pause following the surge in demand during atypically favorable weather conditions over the winter months and the pace of purchases could pick up again
2000-06-28;2000;June;Minute;Negative;0.9929671287536621;while expanding export markets were a welcome development from the perspective of many domestic businesses they would add to overall demand pressures on us producer resources at a time when the latter were already operating at very high levels

2000-06-28;2000;June;Minute;Negative;0.9025012254714966;at the same time members cited anecdotal indications of the emergence of a more cautious tone in the business community evidently associated in part with less favorable financial conditions in debt and equity markets and possibly auguring more substantial cutbacks in business investment over time should growth in personal consumption outlays be sustained on a considerably slower trend
2000-06-28;2000;June;Minute;Positive;0.9565626978874207;new orders for many types of business equipment had remained strong order backlogs had continued to build and it was clear that business executives still anticipated high rates of return on their new investments

2000-06-28;2000;June;Minute;Negative;0.9531696438789368;the slowdown evidently reflected the effects of higher mortgage interest rates on a growing number of homebuyers and probably also the diminishing wealth effects of the earlier runup in stock prices and the cumulatively large additions to the stock of housing in the economy
