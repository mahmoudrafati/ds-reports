2000-10-03;2000;October;Minute;Negative;0.976084291934967;another major source of uncertainty was the prospective performance of productivity
2000-10-03;2000;October;Minute;Positive;0.9324052929878235;largely as a consequence of rapidly expanding new economy investments gains in productivity had occurred at remarkable rates in recent years
2000-10-03;2000;October;Minute;Negative;0.9867021441459656;however the anticipated moderation in the expansion of economic activity and the related softening in expected returns on such investments might well restrain the further expansion of investment spending and limit the associated pickup in productivity
2000-10-03;2000;October;Minute;Negative;0.9928720593452454;once productivity growth tended to level out employers would find it more difficult to offset the rise in their costs that might occur should tight labor markets persist

2000-10-03;2000;October;Minute;Neutral;0.9873778223991394;against the backdrop of these uncertainties and the current performance of the economy all the committee members indicated that they favored an unchanged policy stance for the intermeeting period ahead
2000-10-03;2000;October;Minute;Positive;0.8820582032203674;in support of this view they placed considerable weight on widespread indications reinforced by developments since the august meeting that growth in aggregate demand had moderated appreciably to a pace that improved the prospects for containing pressures on resources
2000-10-03;2000;October;Minute;Positive;0.9831353425979614;moreover the tightening that had occurred in financial conditions through the spring and the rise in energy prices since the fall of 1998 had not yet exerted their full effects on aggregate demand and members expected these effects to contribute to a more sustainable rate of growth in aggregate spending
2000-10-03;2000;October;Minute;Positive;0.9879223704338074;although inflation had picked up a decline in energy prices should it materialize in line with market expectations clearly would have favorable implications for inflation expectations and cost pressures in the economy
2000-10-03;2000;October;Minute;Negative;0.9684141874313354;questions nonetheless remained regarding the extent and duration of the slowdown in the economic expansion and the other factors bearing on the outlook for inflation especially against the backdrop of substantial pressures on labor resources
2000-10-03;2000;October;Minute;Negative;0.9354292750358582;as noted previously the behavior of oil prices was one highly uncertain source of potentially greater inflation pressures
2000-10-03;2000;October;Minute;Neutral;0.9938606023788452;all the members agreed that their views regarding the outlook for inflation were consistent with retaining the press release sentence indicating that the risks remained weighted toward higher inflation over time

2000-10-03;2000;October;Minute;Neutral;0.9749933481216431;to further its longrun objectives the committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 612 percent
2000-10-03;2000;October;Minute;Neutral;0.9668632745742798;the vote also encompassed approval of the sentence below for inclusion in the press statement to be released shortly after the meeting against the background of its longrun goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available the committee believes that the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future
2000-10-03;2000;October;Minute;Neutral;0.9288923144340515;votes for this action
2000-10-03;2000;October;Statement;Neutral;0.9800430536270142;the federal open market committee at its meeting today decided to maintain the existing stance of monetary policy keeping its target for the federal funds rate at 612 percent
2000-10-03;2000;October;Statement;Positive;0.4801231026649475;recent data have indicated that the expansion of aggregate demand has moderated to a pace closer to the enhanced rate of growth of the economys potential to produce
2000-10-03;2000;October;Statement;Positive;0.9897215962409973;the more rapid advances in productivity also continue to help contain costs and hold down underlying price pressures
2000-10-03;2000;October;Statement;Negative;0.9859670996665955;however the utilization of the pool of available workers remains at an unusually high level
2000-10-03;2000;October;Statement;Negative;0.9666830897331238;moreover the increase in energy prices though having limited effect on core measures of prices to date poses a risk of raising inflation expectations
2000-10-03;2000;October;Statement;Positive;0.8871616125106812;the subdued behavior of those expectations so far has contributed importantly to maintaining an environment conducive to maximum sustainable growth
2000-10-03;2000;October;Statement;Neutral;0.8528793454170227;against the background of its longterm goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available the committee believes the risks continue to be weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the future
2000-10-03;2000;October;Minute;Positive;0.9921058416366577;m3 expansion remained robust in august and september though somewhat below the pace in the first half of the year
2000-10-03;2000;October;Minute;Neutral;0.5031222105026245;while the prospects of a significant rise in inflation seemed quite limited for the nearer term the members agreed on the need to remain especially vigilant for signs of potentially rising inflation over the intermediate term particularly since any increase in inflation would occur from a level that in the view of many members was already on the high side of an acceptable range
2000-10-03;2000;October;Minute;Negative;0.7944633364677429;even so any increase in inflation was likely to be modest and gradual and was subject to substantial uncertainty for a variety of reasons
2000-10-03;2000;October;Minute;Negative;0.784732460975647;some expressed the opinion that those risks were now less decidedly tilted to the upside and that a reconsideration of the sentence might be warranted over the next several months but they believed that a change at this point would be premature
2000-10-03;2000;October;Minute;Positive;0.9919143915176392;at the same time the incentive to take advantage of increasingly efficient hightech equipment and software typically available at declining prices would continue to provide an important underpinning for further large gains in investment spending with favorable implications for continued rapid growth in productivity
2000-10-03;2000;October;Minute;Negative;0.9805539846420288;the staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the economic expansion after slowing considerably from its elevated pace of recent quarters would be sustained at a rate a little below the staffs current estimate of the economys potential output
2000-10-03;2000;October;Minute;Neutral;0.9874764084815979;in their assessment of the outlook for inflation members agreed that although forecasts of more moderate growth in aggregate demand at a pace around potential output had substantially reduced the odds on rising inflation the risks still were pointed in that direction on balance
2000-10-03;2000;October;Minute;Positive;0.5236145853996277;the forecast anticipated that the expansion of domestic final demand would be held back to some extent by the eventual disappearance of positive wealth effects associated with outsized earlier gains in equity prices and by higher interest rates
2000-10-03;2000;October;Minute;Negative;0.9934458136558533;as a result growth of spending on consumer durables was expected to remain appreciably below that in recent quarters and housing demand would trend slightly downward
2000-10-03;2000;October;Minute;Positive;0.990766167640686;by contrast business fixed investment notably outlays for equipment and software was projected to remain robust and brisk growth abroad would boost the expansion of us exports for some period ahead
2000-10-03;2000;October;Minute;Neutral;0.45645657181739807;core consumer price inflation was projected to rise a little over the forecast horizon in part as a result of higher import prices but largely as a consequence of further increases in nominal labor compensation gains that would not be fully offset by growth in productivity
2000-10-03;2000;October;Minute;Negative;0.946983277797699;in the committees discussion of current and prospective economic developments members referred to recent statistical and anecdotal information that tended to confirm earlier indications of appreciable slowing in the pace of the expansion from the outsized increases experienced in the latter part of 1999 and the first half of this year
2000-10-03;2000;October;Minute;Negative;0.9821163415908813;several commented that growth of aggregate demand now appeared to be closer to and perhaps slightly below the rate of expansion in the nations output potential
2000-10-03;2000;October;Minute;Neutral;0.9565043449401855;the members recognized that marked uncertainties surrounded any forecast in present circumstances
2000-10-03;2000;October;Minute;Neutral;0.9550343155860901;those uncertainties had been augmented by recent developments in world oil markets and continued to include questions about the extent of further gains in productivity the effects of such gains on the growth of aggregate demand as well as supply and the associated degree of prospective pressures on resources and inflation
2000-10-03;2000;October;Minute;Negative;0.9905192852020264;in the latter regard members anticipated that even assuming reduced economic growth in line with their forecasts and further impressive gains in productivity conditions in labor markets were likely to remain relatively tight and risks persisted that at some point such tightness could exert upward pressures on labor costs and prices
2000-10-03;2000;October;Minute;Negative;0.9854889512062073;developments in world oil markets also might exert continued upward pressure on inflation while at the same time posing a downward risk to economic activity
2000-10-03;2000;October;Minute;Negative;0.9881638884544373;uncertainties relating to political events in the middle east superimposed on limited available inventories of oil products held by producers and refiners had fostered recent spikes in oil prices
2000-10-03;2000;October;Minute;Positive;0.9728790521621704;looking ahead they generally anticipated that the softening in equity prices and the rise in interest rates that had occurred earlier in the year would contribute to keeping growth in demand at a more subdued but still relatively robust pace
2000-10-03;2000;October;Minute;Negative;0.9949920773506165;however financial factors including mortgage interest rates at levels still appreciably above earlier lows and the sideways performance of the stock market were expected to constrain housing activity somewhat over coming quarters though such activity likely would remain on a relatively high plateau
2000-10-03;2000;October;Minute;Negative;0.994517982006073;there already were scattered signs that higher energy prices by reducing income available for discretionary purchases might be damping retail sales
2000-10-03;2000;October;Minute;Neutral;0.6622267961502075;moreover to the extent that relatively high oil prices persisted they were likely to have increasing passthrough effects on core measures of inflation as well as on headline inflation especially if the energy price increases began to affect inflation expectations
