2000-12-19;2000;December;Minute;Negative;0.9379715919494629;in one view even though the risks of a weakening economy had increased a statement of balanced risks would be preferable because further moderation in the expansion might well fail to materialize
2000-12-19;2000;December;Minute;Neutral;0.9613325595855713;nonetheless the committees reasons for not easing today were deemed persuasive by most members while shifting its statement about economic risks seemed clearly justified by recent developments

2000-12-19;2000;December;Minute;Positive;0.8766496777534485;as a consequence most of the members were persuaded that a prudent policy course would be to await further confirmation of a weakening expansion before easing particularly in light of the high level of resource utilization and the experience of recent years when several lulls in the growth of the economy had been followed by a resumption of very robust economic expansion
2000-12-19;2000;December;Minute;Positive;0.9858524799346924;on the other hand any depreciation in the foreign exchange value of the dollar as the economy slowed would help to bolster exports
2000-12-19;2000;December;Minute;Negative;0.9790931940078735;the slowing in the growth of consumer spending that had prompted much of the backup in inventories was evident from a wide variety of information including anecdotal reports from various parts of the country
