2000-08-22;2000;August;Minute;Positive;0.9911244511604309;still the experience of the last few years clearly demonstrated that the dollar was likely to remain strong as long as foreign investors continued to see attractive investment opportunities in the united states
2000-08-22;2000;August;Minute;Negative;0.5839691758155823;past experience also suggested that international capital flows can quickly reverse themselves but the timing of a major turnaround in the dollar if any could not be predicted with any degree of confidence
2000-08-22;2000;August;Minute;Neutral;0.7889859080314636;in the committees discussion of the outlook for inflation members noted that overall measures of price inflation had picked up to fairly high levels by the standards of recent years largely as a result of higher energy costs
2000-08-22;2000;August;Minute;Negative;0.8945925831794739;moreover supply factors in major energy marketspetroleum gas and electricity generating capacitydid not point to significant relief for some considerable period of time

2000-08-22;2000;August;Minute;Negative;0.9935393929481506;nonetheless a number of members were concerned that unusually taut labor markets could begin at some point to show through to increases in labor compensation in excess of productivity gains pressuring unit costs and prices
2000-08-22;2000;August;Minute;Negative;0.973332405090332;evidence of this had yet to emerge perhaps because productivity continued to accelerate but a flattening out of the rate of increase in productivity even at a high level could well pose at some point a risk to continued favorable inflation performance
2000-08-22;2000;August;Minute;Positive;0.9922484159469604;to be sure there were a number of positive factors in the outlook for inflation including highly competitive conditions in many markets stable and relatively favorable expectations with regard to the longerrun inflation outlook and signs that the remarkable acceleration in productivity was continuing
2000-08-22;2000;August;Minute;Negative;0.9868163466453552;on balance however the members saw a mild upward trend in key measures of inflation as a distinct possibility albeit one that was subject to considerable uncertainty

2000-08-22;2000;August;Minute;Positive;0.4577633738517761;in their assessment of factors leading to this decision the members focused on the further evidence that moderating demand and accelerating productivity were closing the gap between the growth of aggregate demand and potential supply even before earlier committee tightening actions had exerted their full restraining effects
2000-08-22;2000;August;Minute;Negative;0.9915711879730225;while such business investment continued to exhibit considerable vigor in many areas it clearly had weakened in others and for the nation as a whole seemed poised for a relatively subdued advance in coming quarters
2000-08-22;2000;August;Minute;Negative;0.9934318661689758;while the recent rally in domestic financial markets could be viewed as having partially eroded the degree of monetary restraint implemented earlier real interest rates for private borrowers were still at relatively elevated levels banking institutions were continuing to report further tightening of their standards and terms for business loans equity prices had risen only modestly and the dollar had firmed over recent months
2000-08-22;2000;August;Minute;Neutral;0.8222516179084778;accordingly the committee incurred little risk in leaving the stance of policy unchanged at this meeting and waiting to see how the various factors affecting both supply and demand in the economy unfolded and influenced the prospects for economic activity and prices
2000-08-22;2000;August;Minute;Neutral;0.9911164045333862;at the same time many members emphasized that the committee needed to be prepared to act promptly should inflationary pressures appear to be intensifying and in the committees discussion of the balanceofrisks sentence to be included in the press statement that would be issued after this meeting all the members agreed that the sentence should continue to indicate that the risks to the economy remained weighted toward higher inflation in the foreseeable future
2000-08-22;2000;August;Minute;Neutral;0.9907140731811523;while the members did not expect underlying inflation to intensify materially especially over the nearer term the statement was intended to express their views about the longer term and over that horizon they agreed that the risks lay in the direction of price acceleration
2000-08-22;2000;August;Minute;Negative;0.9878150224685669;the risks of higher inflation over time were seen importantly to stem from the unusually taut conditions in labor markets which could place upward pressures on unit costs and prices especially once productivity growth leveled out in the future
2000-08-22;2000;August;Minute;Negative;0.8555561900138855;but members also cited the potential for persistently higher energy prices to affect longerrun inflation expectations and the possibility that taking into consideration recent declines in longterm interest rates financial conditions might not yet be tight enough to balance aggregate demand and potential supply in the face of optimism about the growth of labor and capital income in association with accelerating productivity
2000-08-22;2000;August;Minute;Neutral;0.8078758716583252;at the conclusion of this discussion the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york until it was instructed otherwise to execute transactions in the system account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output
2000-08-22;2000;August;Minute;Neutral;0.9749933481216431;to further its longrun objectives the committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 612 percent
2000-08-22;2000;August;Minute;Neutral;0.9668632745742798;the vote also encompassed approval of the sentence below for inclusion in the press statement to be released shortly after the meeting against the background of its longrun goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available the committee believes that the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future
2000-08-22;2000;August;Minute;Neutral;0.9288923144340515;votes for this action
2000-08-22;2000;August;Statement;Neutral;0.9800430536270142;the federal open market committee at its meeting today decided to maintain the existing stance of monetary policy keeping its target for the federal funds rate at 612 percent
2000-08-22;2000;August;Minute;Negative;0.7235791087150574;the forecast anticipated that the expansion of domestic final demand would be held back to some extent by the waning and eventual disappearance of positive wealth effects associated with outsized earlier gains in equity prices and by higher interest rates
2000-08-22;2000;August;Statement;Positive;0.9214634299278259;the data also have indicated that more rapid advances in productivity have been raising that potential growth rate as well as containing costs and holding down underlying price pressures
2000-08-22;2000;August;Statement;Negative;0.9929835796356201;nonetheless the committee remains concerned about the risk of a continuing gap between the growth of demand and potential supply at a time when the utilization of the pool of available workers remains at an unusually high level
2000-08-22;2000;August;Statement;Neutral;0.8801926374435425;against the background of its longterm goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available the committee believes the risks continue to be weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future
2000-08-22;2000;August;Minute;Neutral;0.9558212161064148;in addition the last few readings on core inflation had not suggested a further upward drift unit labor costs were not increasing and longerterm inflation expectations had been stable for some time
2000-08-22;2000;August;Minute;Negative;0.9528050422668457;members noted however that the investment outlook for the nonresidential construction sector presented a much more mixed picture
2000-08-22;2000;August;Statement;Neutral;0.7401063442230225;recent data have indicated that the expansion of aggregate demand is moderating toward a pace closer to the rate of growth of the economys potential to produce
2000-08-22;2000;August;Minute;Negative;0.9911183714866638;although the extraordinary rates of increase in investment outlays currently displayed little or no sign of abating historical patterns indicated that even dramatic surges or shifts in technology invariably lost momentum once the new technology was widely adopted and rates of return on further investments tended to diminish
2000-08-22;2000;August;Minute;Negative;0.9757496118545532;there was no reliable way to anticipate the timing of such a downturn and indeed little reason to expect a turnaround over the nearer term in the current investment boom
2000-08-22;2000;August;Minute;Positive;0.9927607774734497;by contrast the expansion of business fixed investment notably in equipment and software was projected to remain robust and further solid economic growth abroad was expected to boost the expansion of us exports for some period ahead
2000-08-22;2000;August;Minute;Neutral;0.9621015787124634;in the committees discussion of current and prospective economic conditions the members agreed that the information available since midyear provided increased evidence that the growth of aggregate demand and that of aggregate supply were coming into closer balance
2000-08-22;2000;August;Minute;Negative;0.9951010346412659;the statistical evidence reviewed by the committee which was supported by widespread anecdotal reports pointed to a noticeable slowing in the expansion of demand and economic activity
2000-08-22;2000;August;Minute;Negative;0.993269145488739;the slowdown was led by a moderation in consumer spending and some decline in housing expenditures that were occurring even before the full effects of earlier tightening in financial conditions had been felt
2000-08-22;2000;August;Minute;Positive;0.9848479628562927;at the same time an apparent continued acceleration in underlying productivity was boosting the economys potential output growth and in the context of the leveling out of the broadest measures of equity prices this year was doing so without the full feedback on demand of previous such accelerations
2000-08-22;2000;August;Minute;Negative;0.5715890526771545;while prices were rising somewhat more than a year ago most of this pickup seemed to reflect the direct and indirect effects of higher energy prices and the increase in productivity growth had kept unit labor costs well contained despite more rapid gains in compensation
2000-08-22;2000;August;Minute;Positive;0.989301860332489;these developments had much improved the prospects for a sustainable economic expansion at the prevailing stance of monetary policy
2000-08-22;2000;August;Minute;Neutral;0.7390783429145813;even so the members anticipated that labor markets would remain exceptionally tight and with labor compensation already accelerating and higher energy prices potentially raising inflation expectations they agreed that the risks remained weighted toward rising inflation
2000-08-22;2000;August;Minute;Neutral;0.5049964189529419;in the committees discussion of the outlook for the economy members focused considerable attention on the growth rate of the economys supply potentialits ability to satisfy further growth in demand on a sustainable basis
2000-08-22;2000;August;Minute;Positive;0.9851495027542114;the widespread application of technological advances and the associated surge in outlays for capital equipment had been fostering an acceleration in labor productivity that seemed to be ongoing
2000-08-22;2000;August;Minute;Positive;0.8784760236740112;data on productivity and capital accumulation that had become available in recent months had tended to confirm these trends and the statistical evidence was reinforced by comments from many business executives and by persistent upward revisions to longterm profit forecasts which had yet to suggest a leveling out of productivity growth
2000-08-22;2000;August;Minute;Positive;0.9822465777397156;quickening productivity had been the fundamental factor behind the economys remarkable performance in recent years
2000-08-22;2000;August;Minute;Neutral;0.9899145364761353;members noted however that historical episodes involving major changes in productivity trends had been rare and the past therefore provided a limited basis for evaluating the course of future productivity developments
2000-08-22;2000;August;Minute;Neutral;0.5003331303596497;accordingly considerable caution needed to be exercised in assessing the outlook for productivity and in relying on projections of the economy and prices which necessarily embodied judgments about this outlook in making monetary policy
2000-08-22;2000;August;Minute;Neutral;0.4848223030567169;core consumer price inflation was projected to rise somewhat over the forecast horizon in part as a result of higher import prices but largely as a consequence of some further increases in nominal labor compensation gains that would not be fully offset by growth in productivity
2000-08-22;2000;August;Minute;Positive;0.9903607368469238;over the course of recent years accelerating productivity gains had tended to boost aggregate demand by even more than potential aggregate supply owing to the effects of stronger profits on investment spending and through the rising stock market on consumption as well

2000-08-22;2000;August;Minute;Positive;0.963351845741272;however reference also was made to indications that wealth effects were continuing to boost housing demand and prices in parts of the country
2000-08-22;2000;August;Minute;Negative;0.9925139546394348;factors helping to explain the softness in housing which included the rise that had occurred in mortgage interest rates and reported overbuilding in some metropolitan areas were expected to continue to exert some downward pressure on housing activity
2000-08-22;2000;August;Minute;Negative;0.5087077021598816;anecdotal reports from much of the country tended to confirm the statistical evidence of a downward trend in housing starts and home sales
2000-08-22;2000;August;Minute;Neutral;0.7565845251083374;the housing sector provided the clearest indication of a response of aggregate demand to firming interest rates affecting industries producing construction materials and household furnishings
2000-08-22;2000;August;Minute;Negative;0.9902008175849915;while these factors might well continue to damp the growth of consumer spending going forward members noted that consumer confidence remained at a high level consumer incomes were rising and no anecdotal or other evidence pointed to any marked deterioration in consumer spending that would pose a potential threat to the sustainability of the economic expansion
2000-08-22;2000;August;Minute;Positive;0.9894618391990662;in sharp contrast to developments in the consumer and housing sectors business outlays for capital equipment and software had continued to rise at exceptional rates even after several years of rapid growth
2000-08-22;2000;August;Minute;Negative;0.9850234985351562;available data on reduced growth in consumer spending were supported by anecdotal reports of some slippage in retail sales below expectations in several parts of the country
2000-08-22;2000;August;Minute;Negative;0.9421020150184631;however the leveling out in stock prices this year suggested that recent increases in productivity growth had been built into market expectations and prices some time ago and were not likely to provide the same impetus to demand going forward as had past productivity acceleration
2000-08-22;2000;August;Minute;Negative;0.841562032699585;factors underlying these developments included diminishing wealth effects after several months of limited changes in equity prices the cumulative buildup in the stock of motor vehicles and other consumer durables owned by the public and the constraining effects of higher energy prices on incomes available to be spent on other goods and services
2000-08-22;2000;August;Minute;Negative;0.582842230796814;members cautioned nonetheless that the possibility that longterm interest rates and equity prices did not yet adequately reflect ongoing productivity gains could not be ruled out with attendant effects boosting demand
2000-08-22;2000;August;Minute;Positive;0.9745252132415771;the persistence of dramatic expansion evidently reflected expectations that such capital investments would continue to earn very high rates of return
2000-08-22;2000;August;Minute;Neutral;0.9694674611091614;as a consequence judgments about labor market pressures productivity and inflation had to be viewed with care on the basis of evolving developments
2000-08-22;2000;August;Minute;Negative;0.991644561290741;in their review of the outlook for expenditures in key sectors of the economy members observed that growth in consumer spending had moderated substantially after a period of exceptional gains in late 1999 and early 2000 the clearest evidence of softening consumer demand tended to be concentrated in sales of motor vehicles and in housingrelated durable goods
2000-08-22;2000;August;Minute;Negative;0.526096761226654;finally rising productivity clearly had been a major force in containing inflation in a period of unusually low unemployment rates and while some of the interactions between productivity growth and wages and prices could be adduced these interactions involved complex processes that were very difficult to assess given the paucity of prior experience
