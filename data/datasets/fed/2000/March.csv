2000-03-21;2000;March;Minute;Neutral;0.9888527393341064;the principal effect of the expanded collateral authorized last august together with the use of triparty repurchase agreements was to allow passthrough mortgage securities of gnma fnma and fhlmc and stripped securities of the us treasury and federal government agencies to be taken as collateral for repurchase transactions

2000-03-21;2000;March;Minute;Neutral;0.990845263004303;with issue sizes declining such limits might mean that from time to time some portion of the systems maturing bill holdings would be redeemed rather than rolled over in treasury auctions
2000-03-21;2000;March;Minute;Neutral;0.9768747091293335;the manager also intended to roll over maturing holdings of treasury coupon issues in auctions and to add to the systems portfolio to meet permanent reserve needs by purchasing coupon securities in the secondary market
2000-03-21;2000;March;Minute;Neutral;0.9895948171615601;however the amount that could be added through outright purchases without disturbing the treasury market would have to be gauged over time relative to conditions in the market as treasury issuance patterns evolved in response to system purchases and treasury buybacks of coupon securities

2000-03-21;2000;March;Minute;Neutral;0.9850637912750244;the manager indicated that he did not expect to use reverse rps on a regular basis until the systems new trading system became operational but in conjunction with existing triparty arrangements there might be occasions in the interim when the timing of open market operations would make it desirable to use them instead of matched salepurchase transactions
2000-03-21;2000;March;Minute;Neutral;0.49539098143577576;such agreements are equivalent to matched salepurchase transactions which the manager has long been authorized to use but reverse rps have the advantage of much greater flexibility because they are the common practice in financial markets
2000-03-21;2000;March;Minute;Neutral;0.9875855445861816;at the conclusion of this discussion the committee voted unanimously to extend the suspension of several provisions of the guidelines for the conduct of system operations in federal agency issues until the first regularly scheduled meeting in 2001 the committee also accepted a proposal by the manager to make permanent the authority to use reverse repurchase agreements in the conduct of open market operations
2000-03-21;2000;March;Minute;Neutral;0.9793917536735535;they noted that the requested temporary expansion of authority pending the committees consideration of the completed study should not be read as indicating in any way how the committee might ultimately choose to allocate the portfolio and any interim operations in the broader range of collateral should be capable of being unwound without adverse market consequences
2000-03-21;2000;March;Minute;Neutral;0.9861527681350708;the committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead
2000-03-21;2000;March;Minute;Neutral;0.9228745102882385;the members agreed that this action was needed to help bring the growth of aggregate demand into better alignment with the expansion of potential aggregate supply and thereby help avert rising inflationary pressures

2000-03-21;2000;March;Minute;Neutral;0.9267484545707703;open market operations during the intermeeting period were directed toward implementing the desired slightly greater pressure on reserve positions and the federal funds rate averaged very close to the committees 534 percent target
2000-03-21;2000;March;Minute;Negative;0.983991265296936;in the housing sector building activity generally remained at a high level though slipping a bit in some parts of the country and there were only limited indications that the rise in mortgage interest rates was holding down residential construction
2000-03-21;2000;March;Minute;Negative;0.9695745706558228;on the other hand housing and other construction activity reportedly was being retarded by shortages of labor and in some areas of materials as well
2000-03-21;2000;March;Minute;Neutral;0.9643793106079102;on balance recent developments did not augur any significant changes in homebuilding
2000-03-21;2000;March;Minute;Positive;0.9899139404296875;the improved economic outlook for most of the nations important trading partners in association with the fading effects of the dollars earlier appreciation pointed to faster expansion in exports and recent anecdotal reports were broadly consistent with such a development
2000-03-21;2000;March;Minute;Negative;0.6833038926124573;growth in imports was expected to moderate over time though imports currently were still rising rapidly
2000-03-21;2000;March;Minute;Negative;0.9924323558807373;even so prospective developments in the foreign trade sector were not likely to provide much relief to demand pressures on the us economy
2000-03-21;2000;March;Minute;Neutral;0.9784890413284302;with regard to the outlook for inflation members saw little evidence to date of any acceleration in core inflation and unit costs for nonfinancial corporations were unchanged in the fourth quarter

2000-03-21;2000;March;Minute;Negative;0.9524697661399841;the direct and indirect effects of higher fuel prices the rise in other import prices increasing medical costs and some deterioration in surveys of inflation expectations could begin to show through to higher underlying inflation
2000-03-21;2000;March;Minute;Negative;0.9833287000656128;more fundamentally however the members believed that current growth in aggregate demand should it persist would continue to exceed the expansion of potential output and by putting added pressure on already tight labor markets would at some point foster inflationary imbalances that would undermine the economic expansion
2000-03-21;2000;March;Minute;Neutral;0.9863172173500061;in the committees discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead all the members endorsed a proposal to tighten reserve conditions by a slight amount consistent with an increase in the federal funds rate to a level of 6 percent
2000-03-21;2000;March;Minute;Positive;0.98919278383255;persisting strength in aggregate domestic demand had been accommodated thus far without a pickup in underlying inflation because of the remarkable acceleration in productivity and because of two safety valvesthe economys ability to draw on the pool of available workers and to finance the rapid growth in imports relative to exports
2000-03-21;2000;March;Minute;Negative;0.9865552186965942;however a further acceleration in productivity was unlikely to boost the economys growth potential sufficiently to satisfy the expansion in aggregate demand without some slowing in the latter

2000-03-21;2000;March;Minute;Negative;0.9332939982414246;in these circumstances the members saw substantial risks of rising pressures on labor and other resources and of higher inflation that called for some further firming of monetary policy at this meeting
2000-03-21;2000;March;Minute;Neutral;0.9842442274093628;they agreed though that because a significant acceleration in inflation did not appear to be imminent and because uncertainties continued to surround the economic outlook a gradual approach to policy adjustments was warranted
2000-03-21;2000;March;Minute;Neutral;0.9835995435714722;the members also agreed that the risks remained weighted mainly in the direction of greater inflation pressures and that further tightening actions might be necessary to bring about financial conditions that were sufficiently firm to contain upward pressures on labor costs and prices
2000-03-21;2000;March;Statement;Neutral;0.9438860416412354;against the background of its longrun goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available the committee believes the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future
2000-03-21;2000;March;Statement;Negative;0.9901566505432129;the committee remains concerned that increases in demand will continue to exceed the growth in potential supply which could foster inflationary imbalances that would undermine the economys record economic expansion

2000-03-21;2000;March;Minute;Neutral;0.5907711982727051;the members agreed that the press statement to be issued shortly after this meeting should continue to highlight their view that even after todays tightening move the risks would remain tilted toward heightened inflation pressures
2000-03-21;2000;March;Minute;Positive;0.8186636567115784;even after taking account of the lagged effects of the considerable tightening that already had been implemented since mid1999 additional tightening might well be needed to ensure that financial conditions would adjust sufficiently to bring aggregate demand into better balance with potential supply and thereby counter a possible escalation of pressures on labor costs and prices
2000-03-21;2000;March;Minute;Neutral;0.9823869466781616;looking ahead the committee would continue to assess the need for further tightening to contain inflation
2000-03-21;2000;March;Minute;Negative;0.9809864163398743;some members commented that although a more forceful policy move of 50 basis points might be needed at some point measured and predictable policy tightening moves such as the one contemplated today still were desirable in current circumstances which included somewhat unsettled financial markets
2000-03-21;2000;March;Minute;Neutral;0.9667483568191528;the vote also encompassed approval of the sentence below for inclusion in the press statement to be released shortly after the meeting against the background of its longrun goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available the committee believes the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future
2000-03-21;2000;March;Minute;Negative;0.9951452612876892;while the associated capital investments undoubtedly had contributed to the acceleration in productivity some members expressed concern that the historically elevated valuations of many hightech stocks were subject to a sizable market adjustment at some point
