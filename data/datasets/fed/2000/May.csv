2000-05-16;2000;May;Minute;Neutral;0.4612000286579132;there were more reports that rising wages and benefits and increasing costs of nonlabor inputs could no longer be fully offset by improvements in productivity and more business firms appeared to be attempting or considering increases in their selling prices to maintain or improve their profit margins
2000-05-16;2000;May;Minute;Negative;0.9947826266288757;however their ability to set higher prices or at least to raise them significantly continued to be severely constrained by the persistence of strong competition across much of the economy

2000-05-16;2000;May;Minute;Positive;0.9904618859291077;the strength in demand might itself be at least in part the result of the ongoing acceleration of productivity with the latter feeding back on demand through higher equity prices and profitable investment opportunities

2000-05-16;2000;May;Minute;Negative;0.7930864095687866;the members saw little risk in a relatively aggressive policy move given the strong momentum of the expansion and widespread market expectations of such a move
2000-05-16;2000;May;Minute;Negative;0.9921576976776123;the greater risk to the economic expansion at this point was for policy to be too sluggish in adjusting thereby allowing inflationary disturbances and dislocations to build
2000-05-16;2000;May;Minute;Neutral;0.9472314715385437;a 50 basis point adjustment was more likely to help forestall a rise in inflationary expectations that at least in the opinion of some members already showed signs of worsening

2000-05-16;2000;May;Minute;Negative;0.9944291114807129;a widespread view that the federal reserve would take whatever steps were needed to hold down inflation over time probably had contributed to the persistence of subdued longrun inflation expectations during an extended period when rapidly rising demand was pressing on limited supply resources

2000-05-16;2000;May;Minute;Negative;0.9547752141952515;this view of the risks was based primarily on the persisting momentum of aggregate demand growth and the unusually high level of labor resource utilization

2000-05-16;2000;May;Minute;Negative;0.34500256180763245;core price inflation was projected to rise noticeably over the forecast horizon partly as a result of higher import prices and some firming of gains in nominal labor compensation in persistently tight labor markets that would not be fully offset by productivity growth
2000-05-16;2000;May;Minute;Negative;0.8274869918823242;in the committees review of current and prospective economic and financial developments members focused on persisting indications that aggregate demand was expanding more rapidly than potential supply and that pressures on labor and other producer resources were continuing to increase
2000-05-16;2000;May;Minute;Negative;0.9954223036766052;while there were tentative signs that the growth in demand might be moderating in some key sectors of the economy such as retail sales and housing clearcut evidence of any significant deceleration in the rapid growth of aggregate demand was lacking
2000-05-16;2000;May;Minute;Neutral;0.9840235710144043;bond yields and other financial conditions had firmed to some extent recently but those adjustments had been influenced by the buildup in market expectations of more monetary policy tightening
2000-05-16;2000;May;Minute;Negative;0.9849809408187866;in the absence of further monetary restraint any slowing over coming quarters was not viewed as likely to be sufficient to avert increasing pressures on the economys already strained resources and rising inflation rates that would undermine the economys remarkable performance
2000-05-16;2000;May;Minute;Negative;0.9929950833320618;adding to concerns about heightened inflation pressures was statistical and anecdotal evidence that could be read as suggesting that underlying inflation already was beginning to pick up
2000-05-16;2000;May;Minute;Negative;0.9914510846138;unit costs however were still remarkably subdued and members saw no developments at this stage that might augur a sharp nearterm deterioration in price inflation
2000-05-16;2000;May;Minute;Positive;0.9762592315673828;in their assessment of business conditions across the country members commented on continuing indications of robust economic activity in all regions and widely increasing pressures on labor and other resources
2000-05-16;2000;May;Minute;Positive;0.9182249307632446;indeed economic activity appeared to have grown appreciably further from already elevated levels in numerous parts of the country although the latest regional data and anecdotal reports provided scattered indications that business conditions might be starting to soften in some areas
2000-05-16;2000;May;Minute;Negative;0.946201503276825;in this regard members referred to the emergence of slightly more cautious attitudes on the part of some business executives concerning the prospects for their industries
2000-05-16;2000;May;Minute;Positive;0.9576730728149414;from the fourth quarter of 1999 through april m2 and m3 expanded at rates well above the upper ends of their annual ranges for 2000 total domestic nonfinancial debt continued to expand at a pace in the upper portion of its range
2000-05-16;2000;May;Minute;Negative;0.9689531326293945;retail sales had edged lower in april but members commented that it was too early to gauge whether this softening was a harbinger of a more moderate trend
2000-05-16;2000;May;Minute;Negative;0.9881529211997986;with respect to developments in key expenditure sectors of the economy growth in consumer spending was expected to slow from the exceptional pace of the first quarter though still likely to be relatively robust
2000-05-16;2000;May;Minute;Positive;0.7938129305839539;looking ahead further rapid growth was expected in spending for business equipment and software in light of likely ongoing efforts to hold down costs by substituting capital embodying advanced technology for scarce labor resources
2000-05-16;2000;May;Minute;Positive;0.9922283291816711;business investment spending retained strong upward momentum though it had exhibited an uneven growth pattern in recent quarters that importantly reflected y2k effects
2000-05-16;2000;May;Minute;Negative;0.9468598365783691;on the assumption of further growth in jobs and incomes in line with current forecasts and absent markedly higher mortgage financing costs housing activity might reasonably be expected to settle at a level a bit below recent highs
2000-05-16;2000;May;Minute;Positive;0.9865207672119141;even so members continued to identify areas of remarkable strength across the nation and overall housing construction remained at an elevated level
2000-05-16;2000;May;Minute;Negative;0.9687610864639282;the evidence of a downturn in homebuilding was still quite marginal but some anecdotal reports suggested that higher mortgage rates were starting to exert a retarding influence on housing demand
2000-05-16;2000;May;Minute;Positive;0.957923173904419;recent order trends and rising capacity utilization rates were consistent with this expectation
2000-05-16;2000;May;Minute;Neutral;0.9298104047775269;the failure of further large increases to materialize should that occur would over time imply a more neutral or even a negative net impact from wealth once the positive effects of the earlier advance had played themselves out but the latter would take some time
2000-05-16;2000;May;Minute;Positive;0.9920274615287781;consumer sentiment had remained upbeat in the context of an extended period of sizable expansion in employment and incomes and the sharp rise in stock market prices over the course of recent years
2000-05-16;2000;May;Minute;Neutral;0.9917391538619995;the same background factors were likely to govern the prospective behavior of housing activity
2000-05-16;2000;May;Minute;Positive;0.9607471227645874;expenditures on nonresidential structures and other construction generally had strengthened in recent months and members expected them to be well maintained in part because of heavy spending on roads and other public projects by state and local governments
2000-05-16;2000;May;Minute;Negative;0.678512454032898;higher financing costs probably also were beginning to play a role
2000-05-16;2000;May;Minute;Negative;0.9876794219017029;looking ahead the experience of recent years amply demonstrated the difficulty of forecasting the performance of the stock market
2000-05-16;2000;May;Minute;Negative;0.9155183434486389;some members observed that the slightly less ebullient consumer behavior recently might have been influenced to some extent by the volatility and downward movement in the stock market over the course of the past several weeks
