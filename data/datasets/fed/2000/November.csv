2000-11-15;2000;November;Minute;Neutral;0.6646748185157776;whether offsetting increases in the growth of labor productivity would materialize was open to question in part because productivity growth might tend to level out in the context of less ebullient expansion in business investment
2000-11-15;2000;November;Minute;Negative;0.9905154705047607;the members believed that growth in labor compensation was likely to remain under upward pressure from the anticipated persistence of very tight conditions in labor markets that would enable wages to catch up to earlier gains in labor productivity
2000-11-15;2000;November;Minute;Neutral;0.7321171164512634;looking to the future however the members generally agreed that the risks were in the direction of a heightening in inflation pressures despite their belief that growth in overall demand now seemed to have declined to a more sustainable pace and probably would continue to expand for a time at a rate below that of the economys output potential
2000-11-15;2000;November;Minute;Negative;0.9890918731689453;to date competitive pressures were continuing to inhibit the ability of many firms to pass on those costs although a significant exception was a number of successful efforts to impose energy surcharges
2000-11-15;2000;November;Minute;Neutral;0.47976595163345337;even so higher interest rates and increased energy and other input costs were adding to overall production expenses

2000-11-15;2000;November;Minute;Neutral;0.8657023310661316;another key factor in the outlook for inflation was the course of oil and other energy prices
2000-11-15;2000;November;Minute;Negative;0.9290696382522583;measures of labor compensation appeared to be accelerating partly as a result of sharply rising health benefit costs
2000-11-15;2000;November;Minute;Negative;0.9955535531044006;still growth had slowed more quickly than many members had anticipated and financial market and other developments now seemed more likely to keep pressures on resources from mounting over coming quarters
2000-11-15;2000;November;Minute;Neutral;0.9726288914680481;the members agreed that a stronger case could be made for a shift to a balanced risk statement than at the previous meeting
2000-11-15;2000;November;Minute;Positive;0.9570761919021606;by contrast business fixed investmentnotably outlays for equipment and softwarewas projected to remain relatively robust and brisk growth abroad would undergird the expansion of us exports
2000-11-15;2000;November;Statement;Negative;0.9858118295669556;the committee accordingly continues to see a risk of heightened inflation pressures
2000-11-15;2000;November;Statement;Negative;0.9554756283760071;the utilization of the pool of available workers remains at an unusually high level and the increase in energy prices though having limited effect on core measures of prices to date still harbors the possibility of raising inflation expectations
2000-11-15;2000;November;Statement;Neutral;0.9800430536270142;the federal open market committee at its meeting today decided to maintain the existing stance of monetary policy keeping its target for the federal funds rate at 612 percent

2000-11-15;2000;November;Minute;Neutral;0.837374210357666;under the circumstances the members focused at this meeting on the potential desirability of moving from a statement of risks weighted toward rising inflation to one that indicated a balanced view of the risks to the committees goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth
2000-11-15;2000;November;Minute;Neutral;0.9749933481216431;to further its longrun objectives the committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 612 percent
2000-11-15;2000;November;Minute;Neutral;0.9871671795845032;the members concluded that retaining a risk statement weighted toward more inflation pressures would best represent their current thinking but they believed it was desirable to provide some recognition of the emergence of increased downside risks to the economic expansion in the statement to be released after this meeting
2000-11-15;2000;November;Minute;Negative;0.9818968772888184;moreover a shift in the committees published views might induce an undesirable softening in overall financial market conditions which in itself would tend to add to inflation pressures
2000-11-15;2000;November;Minute;Negative;0.9927170276641846;and while the members could see an increased risk of a marked slowing of growth relative to the rapid rate of expansion of the economys potential the degree to which growth in demand might remain sufficiently damped to contain and offset those inflation pressures was quite uncertain
2000-11-15;2000;November;Minute;Negative;0.992708146572113;concerns about the possibility of rising inflation persisted
2000-11-15;2000;November;Minute;Neutral;0.5840803980827332;even so they were unanimous in concluding that such a change would be premature at this time

2000-11-15;2000;November;Minute;Positive;0.9679608345031738;however core consumer price measures also displayed a gradual uptrend perhaps only in part as a consequence of the passthrough effects of persistently high energy prices
2000-11-15;2000;November;Statement;Negative;0.9631572961807251;however softening in business and household demand and tightening conditions in financial markets over recent months suggest that the economy could expand for a time at a pace below the productivityenhanced rate of growth of its potential to produce
2000-11-15;2000;November;Minute;Negative;0.9900533556938171;members continued to be concerned about the outlook for inflation
2000-11-15;2000;November;Minute;Negative;0.9909970760345459;rising interest and energy costs in conjunction with restraint on the prices of final output had depressed the earnings and stock market valuations of many firms notably in the hightech area with adverse repercussions on their ability to borrow and willingness to invest and on the financial position of the households holding their equity shares
2000-11-15;2000;November;Minute;Negative;0.9955559372901917;lender caution and less receptive markets probably had contributed to considerable weakening recently in overall growth of credit to nonfinancial businesses
