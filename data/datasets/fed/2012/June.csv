2012-06-20;2012;June;Minute;Negative;0.8961097598075867;information from manufacturing and transportation firms was generally less optimistic than earlier in the year
2012-06-20;2012;June;Minute;Positive;0.9656597375869751;anecdotal evidence from business contacts indicated that activity in the energy and agriculture sectors continued to advance in recent months
2012-06-20;2012;June;Minute;Neutral;0.9857218265533447;most participants viewed the risks to their inflation outlook as being roughly balanced
2012-06-20;2012;June;Minute;Negative;0.9926861524581909;several participants noted that they saw little if any evidence of price pressures commenting that increases in labor costs continued to be subdued and that nonenergy commodity prices had declined of late
2012-06-20;2012;June;Minute;Negative;0.9888830780982971;measures of consumer price inflation declined over the intermeeting period mainly reflecting reductions in oil and gasoline prices since earlier in the year
2012-06-20;2012;June;Minute;Negative;0.9632124900817871;these arguments imply that slack in labor markets remains considerable and therefore that a reduction in the unemployment rate toward its longerrun normal level would not have much effect on inflation
2012-06-20;2012;June;Minute;Negative;0.9609197974205017;another participant pointed to research showing that in many countries inflation is less responsive to downward pressure from labor market slack when inflation is already low than when inflation is elevated and to evidence that firms in the united states have been reluctant to cut nominal wages in recent years as indications that sizable slack might not cause inflation to decline from its already low level
2012-06-20;2012;June;Minute;Neutral;0.7254127264022827;these participants cited a range of evidence to support their judgment the stillhigh fraction of workers who report working parttime jobs because they cannot find fulltime work research showing that jobfinding rates among the longterm unemployed were somewhat higher in the recent past than a year earlier anecdotal evidence to the effect that employers do not see long spells of unemployment as making applicants less attractive for most jobs and reports that employers were receiving large numbers of applications for each opening and were being especially discriminating when filling vacant positions
2012-06-20;2012;June;Minute;Negative;0.995511531829834;some other participants acknowledged that structural factors were contributing to unemployment but said that in their view slack remained high and weak aggregate demand was the major reason that the unemployment rate was still elevated
2012-06-20;2012;June;Minute;Neutral;0.7107228636741638;one implication of the view that there is relatively little slack is that providing more monetary stimulus would be likely to raise inflation above the committees objective
2012-06-20;2012;June;Minute;Negative;0.9374338388442993;a couple of participants said they would have expected inflation to slow noticeably if there were substantial and persistent slack
2012-06-20;2012;June;Minute;Negative;0.7991310954093933;some participants judged that the unemployment rate was being substantially boosted by structural factors such as mismatches between the skills of unemployed workers and those required for available jobs a view that would imply less slack in labor markets than suggested by a simple comparison of the current unemployment rate to participants estimates of its longerrun normal level
2012-06-20;2012;June;Minute;Neutral;0.9842580556869507;meeting participants again discussed the extent of slack in labor markets
2012-06-20;2012;June;Minute;Neutral;0.9812183976173401;even so average monthly growth in payrolls from january through may was in line with last years pace
2012-06-20;2012;June;Minute;Negative;0.6346784830093384;with longerrun inflation expectations well anchored and the unemployment rate elevated almost all participants anticipated that inflation in coming quarters and over the medium run would be at or below the 2 percent rate that the committee judges to be most consistent with its mandate several had revised down their inflation forecasts
2012-06-20;2012;June;Minute;Negative;0.9927984476089478;job growth late last year and early this year was boosted by unusually mild winter weather some slowing had been expected as weather became more normal during the spring but the reported slowing was more substantial than many participants had anticipated
2012-06-20;2012;June;Minute;Neutral;0.8455663323402405;there were a number of reports of slowing sales to europe and asia
2012-06-20;2012;June;Minute;Negative;0.9913470149040222;one participant noted that the apparent tension between strong employment growth and moderate output growth seen earlier in the year had been resolved more recently by slower job growth rather than faster output growth
2012-06-20;2012;June;Minute;Negative;0.9895546436309814;contacts in some parts of the country also indicated that firms had become more cautious in their hiring and investment decisions with most capital investment being undertaken to improve productivity and reduce costs rather than to expand capacity
2012-06-20;2012;June;Minute;Negative;0.9743399620056152;some participants cited examples of business contacts saying that heightened uncertainty about future tax and regulatory policies had led them to put potential investment projects on hold until the uncertainty is resolved
2012-06-20;2012;June;Minute;Negative;0.9917791485786438;participants expected that fiscal policy would continue to be a drag on economic growth over coming quarters
2012-06-20;2012;June;Minute;Negative;0.98715740442276;they generally also saw the federal budget situation as a downside risk to the economic outlook if an agreement was not reached to address the expiring tax cuts and scheduled spending reductions in current law a sharp tightening of fiscal policy would occur at the start of 2013 a few participants reported hearing that defense contractors were making contingency plans to reduce their workforces if potential spending cuts go into effect one reported that some firms already had begun to make such reductions
2012-06-20;2012;June;Minute;Negative;0.994036078453064;some participants however saw persistent slack in resource utilization as weighting the risks to the outlook for inflation to the downside
2012-06-20;2012;June;Minute;Positive;0.9896798729896545;exports helped support us economic growth during the early months of this year
2012-06-20;2012;June;Minute;Negative;0.9905540347099304;however another participant noted that recent appreciation of the dollar in foreign exchange markets would also contribute to reduced exports
2012-06-20;2012;June;Minute;Positive;0.9816905856132507;in contrast it was noted that an agreement on a credible longerterm plan that put the federal budget on a sustainable path over the medium run in a way that removes the nearterm fiscal risks to the recovery would help alleviate uncertainty likely would have positive effects on consumer and business sentiment and so could spur an increase in business investment and hiring
2012-06-20;2012;June;Minute;Negative;0.7024161219596863;a couple of participants expressed the view that the direct effects on the us economy stemming from slower economic growth abroadeffects that would be manifested through declining us exportswould be noticeable but not large
2012-06-20;2012;June;Minute;Negative;0.993248701095581;the pace of improvement in labor market conditions diminished in recent months in particular growth in employment slowed
2012-06-20;2012;June;Minute;Negative;0.9935227632522583;however recent reports from some business contacts pointed to slowing exports to europe and china and several participants noted the risk that economic weakness in europe or a more significant slowing in the pace of expansion in emerging markets in asia could damp exports further
