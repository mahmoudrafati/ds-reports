2012-12-12;2012;December;Minute;Neutral;0.9891542792320251;the committee judged that such accommodation should be provided in part by continuing to purchase mbs at a pace of 40 billion per month and by purchasing longerterm treasury securities initially at a pace of 45 billion per month following the completion of the maturity extension program at the end of the year

2012-12-12;2012;December;Minute;Neutral;0.9934387803077698;participants also discussed the importance of clarifying that the thresholds would not be followed mechanically and that a variety of indicators of labor market conditions and inflation pressures as well as financial developments would be taken into account in setting policy
2012-12-12;2012;December;Minute;Neutral;0.9908177852630615;however a number of participants indicated that the chairmans press conference and other avenues of communication could be used to emphasize for example the distinction between thresholds and the longerrun objectives as well as between thresholds and triggers

2012-12-12;2012;December;Minute;Neutral;0.7618798613548279;however possible advantages of waiting a while to introduce the change to the committees forward guidance were also mentioned including that a delay might simplify communications by keeping the introduction of thresholds separate from the announcement of additional asset purchases
2012-12-12;2012;December;Minute;Neutral;0.9666681289672852;among the benefits of quantitative thresholds that were cited was that they could help the public more readily understand how the likely timing of an eventual increase in the federal funds rate would shift in response to unanticipated changes in economic conditions and the outlook
