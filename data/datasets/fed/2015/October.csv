2015-10-28;2015;October;Minute;Positive;0.9243111610412598;surveys continued to suggest that longerrun inflation expectations remained stable
2015-10-28;2015;October;Minute;Negative;0.9848043918609619;one concern was that such a delay if the reasons were not well understood by market participants could increase uncertainty in financial markets and unduly magnify the perceived importance of the beginning of the policy normalization process
2015-10-28;2015;October;Minute;Negative;0.5472395420074463;a number of participants pointed to various reasons why the committee should avoid a delay in policy firming
2015-10-28;2015;October;Minute;Negative;0.9122813940048218;in assessing whether economic conditions and the mediumterm economic outlook warranted beginning the process of policy normalization at this meeting members noted a variety of indicators including some weakerthanexpected readings on measures of labor market conditions and almost all members agreed it was appropriate to wait for additional information to clarify whether the recent deceleration in the pace of progress in the labor market was transitory or reflected more persistent factors that might jeopardize further progress
2015-10-28;2015;October;Minute;Neutral;0.9870638847351074;nonetheless they agreed to continue monitoring inflation developments closely
2015-10-28;2015;October;Minute;Positive;0.9839584827423096;while inflation was anticipated to remain near its recent low level in the near term reflecting the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices members continued to expect inflation to rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term as the labor market improved further and such transitory effects dissipated
2015-10-28;2015;October;Minute;Neutral;0.9826483726501465;surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations had remained stable marketbased measures of inflation compensation had moved slightly lower
2015-10-28;2015;October;Minute;Negative;0.9852663278579712;inflation continued to run below the committees longerrun objective held down in part by the effects of declines in energy prices and in prices of nonenergy imports
2015-10-28;2015;October;Minute;Neutral;0.9272948503494263;members anticipated that economic activity was likely to expand at a pace sufficient for labor market indicators to continue to move toward or to remain at levels the committee judged consistent with its dual mandate
2015-10-28;2015;October;Minute;Negative;0.993638813495636;almost all members agreed that even though the pace of job gains had slowed and the unemployment rate had held steady over the intermeeting period labor market indicators on balance showed that underutilization of labor resources had diminished since early in the year
2015-10-28;2015;October;Minute;Positive;0.6879647374153137;members indicated that they expected that with appropriate policy accommodation economic activity would continue to expand at a moderate pace
2015-10-28;2015;October;Minute;Negative;0.9948036074638367;with concerns about global economic and financial developments having lessened members continued to see the risks to the outlook for economic activity as nearly balanced although they were still monitoring these developments
2015-10-28;2015;October;Minute;Positive;0.9913421273231506;although net exports had been soft and inventory accumulation appeared to have slowed major domestic components of spending were increasing at solid rates
2015-10-28;2015;October;Minute;Positive;0.8638076782226562;committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead members judged that information received since the fomc met in september indicated that economic activity had been expanding at a moderate pace
2015-10-28;2015;October;Minute;Neutral;0.9867477416992188;these adjustments thus could be either more or less gradual than the committee currently anticipates responding to the committees assessment of the implications of incoming information for the mediumrun outlook
2015-10-28;2015;October;Minute;Neutral;0.9737504720687866;it was also emphasized that while participants most recent economic projections suggested that a gradual increase in the target range for the federal funds rate will likely be appropriate to support progress toward the committees dual objectives monetary policy adjustments ultimately would be dependent on economic and financial developments
2015-10-28;2015;October;Minute;Neutral;0.891147255897522;they indicated that they would be assessing a range of labor market indicators over the period ahead to confirm further improvement in the labor market
2015-10-28;2015;October;Minute;Neutral;0.9433104395866394;participants also indicated that the expected path of policy rather than the timing of the initial increase would be the more important influence on financial conditions and thus on the outlook for the economy and inflation and they noted the importance of underscoring this view at the time of liftoff
2015-10-28;2015;October;Minute;Neutral;0.614220917224884;it was noted that beginning the normalization process relatively soon would make it more likely that the policy trajectory after liftoff could be shallow
2015-10-28;2015;October;Minute;Negative;0.9950597882270813;it was also noted that a decision to defer policy firming could be interpreted as signaling lack of confidence in the strength of the us economy or erode the committees credibility
2015-10-28;2015;October;Minute;Neutral;0.9895690083503723;some participants emphasized that progress toward the committees objectives should be assessed in light of the cumulative gains made to date without placing excessive weight on monthtomonth changes in incoming data
2015-10-28;2015;October;Minute;Negative;0.9835163950920105;several participants indicated that despite lessening concerns about the implications of recent global economic and financial developments for domestic economic activity and inflation appreciable downside risks to the outlook remained
2015-10-28;2015;October;Minute;Negative;0.994786262512207;they were concerned about a potential loss of momentum in the economy and the associated possibility that inflation might fail to increase as expected
2015-10-28;2015;October;Minute;Negative;0.9327753186225891;such concerns might suggest that the initiation of the normalization process may not yet be warranted
2015-10-28;2015;October;Minute;Negative;0.9936528205871582;another concern mentioned was the increasing risk of a buildup of financial imbalances after a prolonged period of very low interest rates
2015-10-28;2015;October;Minute;Negative;0.699785590171814;they believed that in these circumstances riskmanagement considerations called for a cautious approach
2015-10-28;2015;October;Minute;Negative;0.532377302646637;they judged it appropriate to wait for additional information providing evidence of further improvement in the labor market and increasing their confidence that inflation was on a path to return to 2 percent over the medium term before raising the target range for the federal funds rate
2015-10-28;2015;October;Minute;Negative;0.9946183562278748;in addition a couple of participants cited concerns that a premature tightening might damage the credibility of the committees inflation objective if inflation stayed below 2 percent for a prolonged period
2015-10-28;2015;October;Minute;Neutral;0.8574310541152954;several participants indicated that in the current low interest rate environment it would be prudent for the committee to consider options for providing additional monetary policy accommodation if the outlook for economic activity were to weaken to a degree that seemed likely to undermine continued progress in labor market conditions and impede the movement of inflation back to the committees 2 percent objective over the medium term
2015-10-28;2015;October;Minute;Negative;0.6105402112007141;it was also noted that the committee would need to reformulate its communications regarding the nearterm outlook for monetary policy if the economic outlook weakened significantly
2015-10-28;2015;October;Minute;Negative;0.9948760867118835;they also noted uncertainty about whether economic growth was robust enough to withstand potential adverse shocks given the limited ability of monetary policy to offset such shocks when the federal funds rate is near its effective lower bound and concern that the beginning of policy normalization might be associated with an unwarranted tightening of financial conditions
2015-10-28;2015;October;Minute;Neutral;0.994971513748169;during their discussion of the likely path for the federal funds rate after the time of the first increase in the target range participants generally agreed that it would probably be appropriate to remove policy accommodation gradually
