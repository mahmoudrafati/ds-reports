2015-12-16;2015;December;Minute;Negative;0.9921444654464722;in the agricultural sector high levels of domestic crop production and weak global demand had depressed commodity prices and farm income was expected to decline
2015-12-16;2015;December;Minute;Negative;0.9778780937194824;however because of the recent further decline in crude oil prices many participants judged that falling energy prices would depress headline inflation somewhat longer than previously anticipated
2015-12-16;2015;December;Minute;Neutral;0.8568541407585144;in particular some participants stressed the importance of the pace of economic growth staying above that of potential output in order to reduce remaining labor underutilization across broader dimensionsfor example by lowering the stillelevated numbers of workers employed part time for economic reasons and by encouraging additional workers who are currently outside the labor force but want a job to reenter the labor force
2015-12-16;2015;December;Minute;Neutral;0.5248916149139404;almost all participants continued to expect that once energy prices and prices of nonenergy commodities stabilized the effects of the declines in those prices on headline and core pce inflation would fade
2015-12-16;2015;December;Minute;Negative;0.9913357496261597;because labor compensation was still increasing at a subdued rate and inflation remained well below 2 percent some participants judged that a moderate further decline in unemployment would be unlikely to lead to a buildup of unduly strong inflation pressures
2015-12-16;2015;December;Minute;Positive;0.9763692021369934;overall taking into account economic developments and the outlook for economic activity and the labor market the committee was now reasonably confident in its expectation that inflation would rise over the medium term to its 2 percent objective
2015-12-16;2015;December;Minute;Negative;0.985441267490387;however for some members the risks attending their inflation forecasts remained considerable
2015-12-16;2015;December;Minute;Negative;0.9748632907867432;among those risks was the possibility that additional downward shocks to prices of oil and other commodities or a sustained rise in the exchange value of the dollar could delay or diminish the expected upturn in inflation
2015-12-16;2015;December;Minute;Positive;0.9869802594184875;most participants expected that the unemployment rate would edge below their estimates of its longerrun level in the coming year and then stabilize for a time with the further strengthening of the labor market helping move inflation higher
2015-12-16;2015;December;Minute;Positive;0.991992175579071;regarding the mediumterm outlook inflation was projected to increase gradually as energy prices and prices of nonenergy imports stabilized and the labor market strengthened
2015-12-16;2015;December;Minute;Negative;0.9778680801391602;members anticipated that the further decline in crude oil prices over the intermeeting period was likely to exert some additional transitory downward pressure on inflation in the near term
2015-12-16;2015;December;Minute;Negative;0.9539403319358826;marketbased measures of inflation compensation remained low some surveybased measures of longerterm inflation expectations had edged down
2015-12-16;2015;December;Minute;Negative;0.9868370294570923;inflation continued to run below the committees longerrun objective held down in part by the effects of declines in energy and nonenergy import prices
2015-12-16;2015;December;Minute;Negative;0.9721989631652832;members agreed that a range of recent labor market indicators including ongoing job gains and declining unemployment showed further improvement and confirmed that underutilization of labor resources had diminished appreciably since early this year
2015-12-16;2015;December;Minute;Positive;0.8856841921806335;overall taking into account domestic and foreign developments members saw the risks to the outlook for both economic activity and the labor market as balanced and they expected that with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy economic activity would most likely continue to expand at a moderate pace
2015-12-16;2015;December;Minute;Positive;0.9922500848770142;although net exports remained soft consumer and business spending remained solid and the housing sector improved further
2015-12-16;2015;December;Minute;Positive;0.8686966300010681;committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead members judged that information received since the fomc met in october indicated that economic activity had been expanding at a moderate pace
2015-12-16;2015;December;Minute;Neutral;0.8539064526557922;a few participants also indicated that significant risks to financial stability should they emerge could alter their view of the appropriate policy path
2015-12-16;2015;December;Minute;Negative;0.9432992339134216;they stressed the importance of communicating clearly that the future policy path could become shallower if the economic expansion weakened and inflation rose more slowly than currently anticipated and that it could become steeper if real activity and inflation surprised to the upside
2015-12-16;2015;December;Minute;Neutral;0.9226267337799072;while viewing a gradual approach to policy normalization as likely to be appropriate given their economic outlook participants emphasized the need to adjust the policy path as economic conditions evolved and to avoid appearing to commit to any specific pace of adjustments
2015-12-16;2015;December;Minute;Neutral;0.9157639145851135;members anticipated that economic activity was likely to continue to expand at a pace sufficient to lead to a further increase in the utilization of labor resources and many members judged that additional progress would be required to reach the committees maximumemployment objective
2015-12-16;2015;December;Minute;Negative;0.9861408472061157;in addition by several estimates the neutral shortterm real interest rate was currently close to zero and was expected to rise only slowly as headwinds restraining the expansion receded
2015-12-16;2015;December;Minute;Negative;0.9884017109870911;financial conditions tightened modestly over the intermeeting period
2015-12-16;2015;December;Minute;Negative;0.7526231408119202;moreover the ability of monetary policy to offset the economic effects of an unanticipated economic shock remained asymmetric and a cautious approach to normalizing policy could help minimize the risk of having to respond to a negative economic shock while the policy rate remained near its effective lower bound
2015-12-16;2015;December;Minute;Neutral;0.8637283444404602;a few commented that a sustained period of labor market activity above levels consistent with maximum employment should speed the rise in inflation to the committees objective
2015-12-16;2015;December;Minute;Negative;0.9918883442878723;concerns among investors about the highyield bond market increased notably in the days before the meeting after an openended mutual fund specializing in junk bonds suspended redemptions and closed
2015-12-16;2015;December;Minute;Negative;0.7526437044143677;in their discussion several participants commented that markets for leveraged finance had been correcting since midyearparticularly for the most risky assets including those associated with energy firmsand noted that the widening of credit spreads in corporate bond markets appeared to be largely due to the repricing of riskier assets
2015-12-16;2015;December;Minute;Positive;0.9465872645378113;quotes in financial markets and survey results suggested that investors were quite confident that the committee would raise the federal funds target range 25 basis points at the current meeting
2015-12-16;2015;December;Minute;Neutral;0.9845407605171204;participants also discussed the implications of economic conditions going forward for the likely future path of the target range for the federal funds rate
2015-12-16;2015;December;Minute;Positive;0.6687422394752502;during their consideration of economic conditions and monetary policy almost all participants agreed that the improvements that had occurred in the labor market and their confidence in a return of inflation to 2 percent over the medium term now satisfied the committees criteria for beginning the policy normalization process
2015-12-16;2015;December;Minute;Neutral;0.8368681073188782;even after the initial increase in the target range the stance of policy would remain accommodative
2015-12-16;2015;December;Minute;Neutral;0.905744731426239;participants saw several reasons why a gradual removal of policy accommodation would likely be appropriate
2015-12-16;2015;December;Minute;Negative;0.8436720967292786;normalizing policy gradually would keep the stance of monetary policy sufficiently accommodative to support further improvement in labor market conditions and to exert upward pressure on inflation
2015-12-16;2015;December;Minute;Neutral;0.538258969783783;also a number of participants pointed out that because inflation was still running well below the committees objective and the outlook for inflation was subject to considerable uncertainty it would probably take some time for the data to confirm that inflation was on a trajectory to return to 2 percent over the medium term
2015-12-16;2015;December;Minute;Neutral;0.9922898411750793;gradual adjustments in the federal funds rate would also allow policymakers to assess how the economy was responding to increases in interest rates
