2015-03-18;2015;March;Minute;Neutral;0.5149489641189575;a few participants observed that the absence of a notable pickup in wages might not be a useful yardstick for evaluating the degree of remaining slack because of the long lags between declines in unemployment and the response of wages or uncertainty about trend productivity growth
2015-03-18;2015;March;Minute;Negative;0.9913322329521179;a few of them noted that continued modest wage growth could prompt them to reduce their estimates of the longerrun normal rate of unemployment

2015-03-18;2015;March;Minute;Neutral;0.9141315817832947;however others anticipated that the effects of energy price declines and the dollars appreciation would continue to weigh on inflation in the near term suggesting that conditions likely would not be appropriate to begin raising rates until later in the year and a couple of participants suggested that the economic outlook likely would not call for liftoff until 2016 with regard to communications about the timing of the first increase in the target range for the federal funds rate two participants thought that the committee should seek to signal its policy intentions at the meeting before liftoff appeared likely but two others judged that doing so would be inconsistent with a meetingbymeeting approach
2015-03-18;2015;March;Minute;Neutral;0.9871457815170288;several participants judged that the economic data and outlook were likely to warrant beginning normalization at the june meeting

2015-03-18;2015;March;Minute;Neutral;0.9704391360282898;it was noted that there were no simple criteria for such a judgment and in particular that in a context of progress toward maximum employment and reasonable confidence that inflation will move back to 2 percent over the medium term the normalization process could be initiated prior to seeing increases in core price inflation or wage inflation
2015-03-18;2015;March;Minute;Neutral;0.993269145488739;participants expressed a range of views about how they would assess the outlook for inflation and when they might deem it appropriate to begin removing policy accommodation

2015-03-18;2015;March;Minute;Neutral;0.9912217855453491;a few participants emphasized that the decision regarding the appropriate timing of liftoff should take account of the risks that could be associated with departing from the effective lower bound later and those that could be associated with departing earlier
2015-03-18;2015;March;Minute;Negative;0.9886372685432434;one participant did not favor the change to the forward guidance because with inflation well below the committees 2 percent longerrun target the announcement of a meetingbymeeting approach to policy could lead to a tightening of financial conditions that would slow progress toward the committees objectives
2015-03-18;2015;March;Minute;Negative;0.9892048835754395;one participant however saw some evidence of rising wage growth and suggested that compositional changes in the labor force could be masking underlying wage pressures particularly as measured by average hourly earnings
2015-03-18;2015;March;Minute;Positive;0.9918402433395386;they continued to expect that inflation would move up toward the committees 2 percent objective over the medium term as the effects of these transitory factors waned and conditions in the labor market improved further
2015-03-18;2015;March;Minute;Neutral;0.9939877986907959;surveybased measures of inflation expectations had remained stable and marketbased measures of inflation compensation over the longer term were about unchanged from the time of the january meeting although they had exhibited some volatility over the intermeeting period
2015-03-18;2015;March;Minute;Neutral;0.9878901839256287;it was noted that the marketbased measures had tracked quite closely the movements in crude oil prices over the period first rising and then falling back
2015-03-18;2015;March;Minute;Neutral;0.9113194346427917;participants offered various explanations for this correlation including that marketbased measures of inflation compensation were responding to the same global developments as oil prices that these measures were capturing changes in risk or liquidity premiums or that inflationindexed securities were subject to mispricing
2015-03-18;2015;March;Minute;Negative;0.9917318224906921;many participants judged that the inflation data received over the intermeeting period had been about in line with their expectations that inflation would move temporarily further below the committees goal largely reflecting declines in energy prices and lower prices of nonoil imports
2015-03-18;2015;March;Minute;Negative;0.9072959423065186;one of them judged that the low level of inflation compensation could reflect increased concern on the part of investors about adverse outcomes in which low inflation was accompanied by weak economic activity and that it was important not to dismiss this possible interpretation
2015-03-18;2015;March;Minute;Neutral;0.9871379137039185;in their discussion of communications regarding the path of the federal funds rate over the medium term almost all participants favored removing from the forward guidance in the committees postmeeting statement the indication that the committee would be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy
2015-03-18;2015;March;Minute;Neutral;0.7507887482643127;these participants continued to think that an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate was unlikely in april
2015-03-18;2015;March;Minute;Neutral;0.9914376139640808;but with continued improvement in economic conditions they preferred language that would provide the committee with the flexibility to subsequently adjust the target range for the federal funds rate on a meetingbymeeting basis
2015-03-18;2015;March;Minute;Neutral;0.9912651181221008;it was noted that eliminating the reference to being patient would be appropriate in light of the considerable progress achieved toward the committees objective of maximum employment and that such a change would not indicate that the committee had decided on the timing of the initial increase in the target range for the federal funds rate
2015-03-18;2015;March;Minute;Negative;0.8528710603713989;a couple of participants pointed out that the movements in crude oil prices and marketbased inflation compensation measures had not been particularly well aligned over a longer historical period or that information gleaned from inflation derivatives suggested a substantial increase in the probability that inflation would remain well below the committees target over the next decade
2015-03-18;2015;March;Minute;Neutral;0.9813435673713684;participants generally judged that the appropriate timing of liftoff would depend on their assessment of improvement in the labor market and their degree of confidence that inflation would move back to the committees 2 percent objective over the medium term and that it would be helpful to convey to the public this datadependent approach to monetary policy
