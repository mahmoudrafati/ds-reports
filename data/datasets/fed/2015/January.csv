2015-01-28;2015;January;Minute;Neutral;0.987064003944397;some participants noted that a relatively high cap could be established and then reduced fairly soon after the initial policy firming if it was determined that it was not needed and that such a reduction could help underscore the committees intent to use such a facility only to the extent necessary

2015-01-28;2015;January;Minute;Neutral;0.9769806861877441;against this backdrop most meeting participants indicated that a sizable on rrp cap would be appropriate to support policy implementation at the time of liftoff and a couple of participants suggested that the aggregate cap might be suspended for a time

2015-01-28;2015;January;Minute;Negative;0.9860368371009827;while acknowledging these concerns many participants believed that a temporarily elevated cap on the on rrp operations at a time when the committee saw conditions as appropriate to begin normalization would likely pose limited risks another participant judged that an on rrp program was in any case unlikely to materially increase the risks to financial stability
2015-01-28;2015;January;Minute;Neutral;0.9939762353897095;a number of participants emphasized that the committee should develop plans to ensure that such a facility is temporary and that it can be phased out once it is no longer needed to help control the federal funds rate

2015-01-28;2015;January;Minute;Neutral;0.9853898286819458;regardless of the particular strategy undertaken it was noted that provided that the datadependent nature of the path for the federal funds rate after its initial increase could be communicated to financial markets and the general public in an effective manner the precise date at which firming commenced would have a less important bearing on economic outcomes
