2001-06-27;2001;June;Minute;Negative;0.9314426779747009;with greater slack in labor and product markets and with inflation expectations contained an added easing ran very little risk of exacerbating price pressures provided the committee was prepared to firm the stance of policy promptly if and when demand pressures threatened to intensify
2001-06-27;2001;June;Minute;Negative;0.9729226231575012;one member was persuaded that policy had already become so expansionary that further easing ran an unacceptable risk of exacerbating inflation over time

2001-06-27;2001;June;Minute;Neutral;0.9570915699005127;to further its longrun objectives the committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with reducing the federal funds rate to an average of around 334 percent

2001-06-27;2001;June;Minute;Negative;0.9878377914428711;in the view of most members however the weakness of the recent information relating to the performance of the economy was consistent with unbalanced risks at least insofar as it pertained to the outlook for the rest of this year and their primary policy concern at this point remained the strength of economic activity rather than potentially worsening inflation over the longer term
2001-06-27;2001;June;Minute;Neutral;0.7195971012115479;the member who opposed additional policy easing expressed strong reservations about such a statement because in his view it likely would be interpreted as an intention to ease policy further which was contrary to his own assessment that a more neutral outlook regarding the future course of policy was desirable
2001-06-27;2001;June;Minute;Negative;0.9896392822265625;on balance further modest growth in nonresidential construction though well below the average pace in recent quarters was seen as a likely prospect

2001-06-27;2001;June;Minute;Neutral;0.9198504090309143;in the view of a number of members the committee might well be near the end of its easing cycle
2001-06-27;2001;June;Minute;Neutral;0.8792960047721863;in these circumstances a smaller move than those undertaken earlier this year would have the advantage of reducing the odds on adding to inflation pressures later and of underlining the committees assessment of its policy stance
2001-06-27;2001;June;Minute;Neutral;0.9869170188903809;but much of the lagged effects of the committees earlier easing actions had not yet been felt in the economy and they would be supplemented in coming quarters by the implementation of the recently legislated tax cut stimulus
2001-06-27;2001;June;Minute;Neutral;0.988678514957428;such a policy stance was appropriate for a time to counter the various forces holding back economic expansion
2001-06-27;2001;June;Minute;Positive;0.9870457649230957;by a number of measuresincluding the level of real federal funds rates the robust growth of the monetary aggregates and the ready availability of finance to most borrowerspolicy had become stimulative
2001-06-27;2001;June;Minute;Neutral;0.8748096823692322;a smaller easing move than those the committee had been making earlier this year was deemed desirable by the members in light of the substantial easing that already had been implemented since the start of this year
2001-06-27;2001;June;Minute;Neutral;0.9847033619880676;at the same time several emphasized that they did not want to rule out further easing later if warranted by the tenor of incoming economic information
2001-06-27;2001;June;Minute;Positive;0.9575286507606506;with regard to the outlook for nonresidential construction activity members referred to signs of developing weakness in some commercial real estate markets but there were few reports of overbuilding and the construction of commercial facilities was being well maintained in other parts of the country
2001-06-27;2001;June;Minute;Positive;0.9717513918876648;in the committees discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead all but one of the members supported both some further easing of reserve conditions consistent with a 25 basis point reduction in the target federal funds rate and the retention of the committees public statement that the risks were weighted toward excessively soft economic performance
2001-06-27;2001;June;Minute;Positive;0.98903489112854;beyond the nearer term however the prospects for an upturn in investment outlays seemed favorable in the context of profit opportunities associated with expectations of continued elevated rates of technological progress and rapid declines in the prices of new equipment

2001-06-27;2001;June;Minute;Negative;0.994272768497467;typical regional reports referred to slowing increases in economic activity from an already reduced pace or to the persistence of sluggish business activity and generally downbeat business sentiment
2001-06-27;2001;June;Minute;Neutral;0.9658294320106506;in preparation for the midyear monetary policy report to congress the members of the board of governors and the presidents of the federal reserve banks provided individual projections of the growth of gdp the rate of unemployment and the rate of inflation for the years 2001 and 2002 the forecasts of the rate of expansion in real gdp had central tendencies of 114 to 2 percent for 2001 suggesting at least a little acceleration in the second half of the year and 3 to 314 percent for 2002 the civilian rates of unemployment associated with these forecasts had central tendencies of 434 to 5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2001 and 434 to 514 percent in the fourth quarter of 2002 forecasts of the rate of inflation as measured by the chain price index for personal consumption expenditures were centered on a range of 2 to 212 percent for this year and 134 to 212 percent in 2002 continuing softness in the expansion of economic activity was mirrored in anecdotal reports of business conditions in much of the nation
2001-06-27;2001;June;Minute;Negative;0.9659649729728699;in an environment of diminished pressures in product and labor markets and of lower energy costs members commented that price pressures were likely to remain contained at least over the near to intermediate term
2001-06-27;2001;June;Minute;Negative;0.9856243133544922;most of the members believed that the risks to the expansion notably for the nearer term remained to the downside of current forecasts
2001-06-27;2001;June;Minute;Negative;0.9921833872795105;it was noted however that the unique characteristics of the current cyclical experience including the heavy concentration of weakness in business expenditures and manufacturing output increased the uncertainty that surrounded any forecast
2001-06-27;2001;June;Minute;Negative;0.9893381595611572;however actions to reduce excess inventories or to address problems relating to overcapacity in some sectors of the economy including telecommunications and other hightech industries were under way and were likely to exert a decreasing drag on economic activity over coming quarters as corrective adjustments were completed
2001-06-27;2001;June;Minute;Positive;0.9841475486755371;in addition the abatement and eventual turnaround of the downward adjustments to capital spending and inventories would add impetus to economic growth going forward
2001-06-27;2001;June;Minute;Negative;0.9938090443611145;weakness in business spending for equipment and software efforts to reduce excess inventories and the ongoing adaptation to lower equity prices in the united states and around the world were likely to hold back economic activity in the short run
2001-06-27;2001;June;Minute;Negative;0.9928449988365173;however recent data indicated that growth of spending and output was quite sluggish and below the pace many members had anticipated at the time of the previous meeting

2001-06-27;2001;June;Minute;Positive;0.9919047355651855;the gradual strengthening of investment together with a projected improvement in foreign economies that was seen as providing some support for us exports would foster the pickup in growth of demand and output
2001-06-27;2001;June;Minute;Positive;0.9863649606704712;in this regard the members reviewed several staff reports that generally concluded that the growth of productivity in the years ahead was highly likely to remain appreciably stronger than it had been from the mid1970s to the mid1990s though how much stronger was an open question
2001-06-27;2001;June;Minute;Positive;0.9800994992256165;business fixed investment notably outlays for equipment and software would be weaker for a while but would return to relatively robust growth after a period of adjustment of capital stocks to more desirable levels
2001-06-27;2001;June;Minute;Positive;0.9904494881629944;nonetheless the members continued to anticipate a strengthening as the year progressed and during 2002 fostered to a large extent by the lagged effects on spending of the substantial easing in monetary policy since early this year the stimulus from recently enacted tax cuts and the positive effects on household and business purchasing power of some recent reductions in energy prices
2001-06-27;2001;June;Minute;Negative;0.9905134439468384;financial conditions while generally supportive of greater spending presented a mixed picture in some respects
2001-06-27;2001;June;Minute;Negative;0.9885818362236023;potential sources of shortfalls included the effects of possible further increases in unemployment on consumer and business confidence the risks of disappointing business earnings that could damp investment and through lower equity prices consumption and the growing indications of weakness in foreign economies that could limit demand for exports
2001-06-27;2001;June;Minute;Negative;0.9937219023704529;caution was especially pronounced among hightech firms many of which had experienced major cutbacks in the demand for their products and services
2001-06-27;2001;June;Minute;Negative;0.9952406883239746;an analysis prepared for this meeting suggested that in the aggregate the apparent overhang of excess capital might not be large but the dimensions and duration of the adjustment in spending on capital goods were a major source of uncertainty in the outlook and there was some risk of substantially greater weakness in investment spending than was forecast for coming months
2001-06-27;2001;June;Minute;Negative;0.9872673153877258;short and intermediateterm interest rates had fallen substantially this year and longterm yields had moved down late last year

2001-06-27;2001;June;Minute;Negative;0.989660382270813;the weakness in spending for new equipment and software had played a key role in the softening of the overall expansion of economic activity in recent quarters and a material pickup in such expenditures did not appear likely until the latter part of this year or early next year

2001-06-27;2001;June;Minute;Positive;0.6983451247215271;housing activity remained at a high level as attractive mortgage interest rates evidently continued to counterbalance the negative effects on consumer attitudes of somewhat weaker labor markets and reduced stock market wealth
2001-06-27;2001;June;Minute;Positive;0.5885811448097229;even so given existing backlogs and the continued availability of attractive mortgage rates nationwide housing construction was expected to remain near its currently elevated level
2001-06-27;2001;June;Minute;Negative;0.9916655421257019;looking ahead the outlook for consumer spending was subject to a number of downside risks that included the possibility of rising unemployment and further weakness in the stock market which could damp consumer confidence as well as income and wealth
2001-06-27;2001;June;Minute;Positive;0.9919509887695312;members referred in particular to the persisting strength in demand for light motor vehicles which evidently was boosted by continuing sales incentives and attractive financing terms
2001-06-27;2001;June;Minute;Negative;0.9714934825897217;growth in consumer spending for goods and services while moderating appreciably since earlier in the year had nonetheless held up unexpectedly well given the adverse wealth effects associated with the declines in stock market prices relatively high levels of consumer indebtedness and job losses in a growing number of industries
2001-06-27;2001;June;Minute;Positive;0.9625417590141296;in their comments about developments in key sectors of the economy members noted that overall business activity had been supported at least to this point by the relative strength of household demand
2001-06-27;2001;June;Minute;Positive;0.8684612512588501;though lenders were cautious about marginally creditworthy firms most businesses were finding ample credit available at attractive terms
2001-06-27;2001;June;Minute;Negative;0.5284891128540039;but equity prices were only holding their own after a substantial decline earlier and the dollar had appreciated
2001-06-27;2001;June;Minute;Positive;0.8343284726142883;however some further growth in consumer spending remained the most likely prospect for the balance of the year in light of the impetus provided by monetary and fiscal policy and the apparent stabilization in consumer sentiment in recent months after its earlier decline
