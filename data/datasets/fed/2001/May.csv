2001-05-15;2001;May;Minute;Positive;0.7831288576126099;at the same time the members anticipated that a neutral balance of risks statement could be appropriate before long probably well before substantial evidence had emerged that economic growth had strengthened appreciably once the committee could see that policy had eased enough to promote a future return to maximum sustainable economic growth
2001-05-15;2001;May;Minute;Neutral;0.5603439807891846;indeed it was not clear how much more the federal funds rate might have to be reduced after today in the absence of further significantly adverse shocks and some members noted that the end of the easing process might be near

2001-05-15;2001;May;Minute;Positive;0.9870549440383911;this view was premised in large measure on the lagged effects of the committees relatively aggressive easing actions this year including any further easing that might be adopted at this meeting growing prospects of some fiscal policy stimulus later in the year and more generally the favorable effects of still substantial productivity gains on profit opportunities and income growth and hence on business and household demands for goods and services
2001-05-15;2001;May;Statement;Negative;0.9935492873191833;this potential restraint together with the possible effects of earlier reductions in equity wealth on consumption and the risk of slower growth abroad continues to weigh on the economy

2001-05-15;2001;May;Minute;Neutral;0.9480518102645874;to further its longrun objectives the committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with reducing the federal funds rate to an average of around 4 percent
2001-05-15;2001;May;Minute;Neutral;0.8078758716583252;at the conclusion of this discussion the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york until it was instructed otherwise to execute transactions in the system account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output
2001-05-15;2001;May;Minute;Negative;0.946132242679596;even so with the economy perhaps still in the midst of a process of weakening growth in aggregate demand of unknown persistence and dimension the members generally agreed that given prevailing uncertainties it would be premature for the committee to shift its balance of risks statement at this time
2001-05-15;2001;May;Minute;Neutral;0.9861693382263184;moreover not all measures of core inflation had accelerated in particular core pce price inflation had been quite stable on a twelvemonth basis for some time
2001-05-15;2001;May;Minute;Negative;0.5501300096511841;to a considerable extent however any uptick in inflation expectations likely represented a reversal of anticipated declines in inflation earlier this year when economic prospects had seemed weaker and survey data did not confirm any increase in longterm inflation expectations
2001-05-15;2001;May;Statement;Positive;0.9904449582099915;although measured productivity growth stalled in the first quarter the impressive underlying rate of increase that developed in recent years appears to be largely intact supporting longerterm prospects
2001-05-15;2001;May;Minute;Neutral;0.8692395687103271;in this regard they noted that some of the recent increases in bond yields could represent a rise in longterm inflation expectations
2001-05-15;2001;May;Minute;Negative;0.9598539471626282;it was difficult to see any signs of a significant nearterm turnaround in business spending for equipment and software and the timing and strength of a subsequent rebound would depend importantly on the outlook for sales and profits
2001-05-15;2001;May;Minute;Negative;0.6351479291915894;members cited anecdotal and survey reports that indicated many business firms were canceling cutting back or stretching out planned capital expenditures
2001-05-15;2001;May;Minute;Negative;0.9936988353729248;a softening in business demand for capital equipment had accounted for much of the slowdown in the growth of final demand in late 2000 and early 2001 the latest available data on new orders pointed to further and possibly larger declines in business spending on equipment and software over the months ahead
2001-05-15;2001;May;Minute;Negative;0.9780412316322327;while the prevailing negative influences on household spending might spill over a bit more to housing activity over the year ahead there were few current developments in housing markets that might be read as signaling any marked weakening in this sector of the economy
2001-05-15;2001;May;Minute;Positive;0.879851222038269;housing prices had tended to edge higher across the nation though there were signs that the price appreciation had eased in some parts of the country notably on the west coast
2001-05-15;2001;May;Minute;Positive;0.9884098768234253;housing activity was described as a source of strength in many regions
2001-05-15;2001;May;Minute;Positive;0.9891979098320007;household expenditures on home construction had been maintained at a relatively robust level in recent months evidently reflecting the cushioning effects of very attractive mortgage interest rates
2001-05-15;2001;May;Minute;Negative;0.9931063055992126;as in the past consumer spending attitudes likely would depend importantly on trends in employment and income and further increases in unemployment in the period just ahead along with the negative wealth effects of earlier stock market price declines and the persistence of high energy costs were likely to constrain the growth in consumer expenditures over coming quarters
2001-05-15;2001;May;Minute;Negative;0.9889798164367676;a recent survey had indicated that consumer sentiment had firmed a little but the survey results had yet to be confirmed by additional surveys and the level of consumer confidence was still well below earlier highs
2001-05-15;2001;May;Minute;Positive;0.9447683095932007;members noted that business confidence had deteriorated but some also observed that the pessimism tended to be limited to the nearer term and was accompanied by favorable expectations regarding the outlook later in the year and in 2002 with regard to the outlook for key sectors of the economy a number of members commented that consumer spending had held up reasonably well in recent months despite a variety of adverse developments including the negative wealth effects of stock market declines widely publicized job cutbacks heavy consumer debt loads and previous overspending by many consumers
2001-05-15;2001;May;Minute;Positive;0.9818187355995178;at the same time pockets of strength could be found in a number of industries notably in energy and construction and overall business activity continued to display considerable vigor in a number of regions
2001-05-15;2001;May;Minute;Negative;0.9865836501121521;weakness remained especially pronounced in manufacturing but as reflected in the employment data for april and in widespread anecdotal reports softening had spread to other sectors of the economy as well
2001-05-15;2001;May;Minute;Negative;0.9937189817428589;in their review of developments across the nation members referred to quite sluggish economic conditions in many parts of the country
2001-05-15;2001;May;Minute;Negative;0.9924454092979431;the members were uncertain as to the degree and timing of the strengthening in final demand and although a relatively prompt and strong rebound could not be ruled out many saw a variety of factors that pointed to the possibility that the upturn could be weaker or more delayed than the central tendencies of their expectations
2001-05-15;2001;May;Minute;Negative;0.7689911723136902;such a rise would not be entirely unexpected in the context of improving sentiment about the strength of the expansion the potentially adverse implications for costs of the cyclical weakness in productivity and the possibility that high energy prices and their passthrough effects might persist longer than had been anticipated earlier
2001-05-15;2001;May;Minute;Negative;0.9836279153823853;with regard to profit expectations the most recent data showed continued markdowns but the pace of downward revisions was diminishing
2001-05-15;2001;May;Minute;Negative;0.993252694606781;it was too early to conclude that the outlook for profits might be approaching a degree of stability or be near the point of turning up and in any event it was clear that business sentiment currently was quite gloomy
2001-05-15;2001;May;Minute;Positive;0.9204844832420349;with regard to the outlook for inflation a number of members expressed concern about a tendency for some measures of inflation to edge higher this year but many members expected that the easing of pressures in labor and product markets that already had occurred and were likely to continue in the months ahead would damp inflation going forward
2001-05-15;2001;May;Minute;Negative;0.9928427934646606;in the meantime nonresidential construction and energyrelated investments were a source of some support to investment spending but they provided only a very partial offset to widespread weakness in other business spending
2001-05-15;2001;May;Minute;Positive;0.9917307496070862;looking to the future however members anticipated that continuing gains in efficiency engendered by new technologies would provide substantial profit opportunities and likely strengthen investment spending during the course of the year ahead
2001-05-15;2001;May;Minute;Positive;0.8988064527511597;whatever its precise timing the expansionary fiscal package would undoubtedly join at some point in coming quarters with the lagged effects of the systems policy easing actions to foster strengthening economic expansion
2001-05-15;2001;May;Minute;Positive;0.9800311326980591;while the exact structure of tax cuts was still being negotiated passage of new fiscal measures seemed imminent and likely would help bolster consumption spending beginning later in the year
2001-05-15;2001;May;Minute;Positive;0.976769745349884;the nations fiscal outlook was seen as supportive of aggregate demand
2001-05-15;2001;May;Minute;Positive;0.9929110407829285;on balance while the external risks to the us economy clearly were to the downside at least over the nearer term the prospective rebound in us economic activity and stimulative macroeconomic policies abroad were expected to contribute to strengthening growth worldwide and to improving prospects for exports during the year ahead
2001-05-15;2001;May;Minute;Negative;0.9942861199378967;members noted however that in some nations persisting structural problems presented threats to national economic prosperity and international trade
2001-05-15;2001;May;Minute;Positive;0.9906127452850342;the anticipated recovery in this country would help to strengthen many foreign economies and in turn improve prospects for us exports
2001-05-15;2001;May;Minute;Negative;0.9951047897338867;a number of members commented that the persisting updrift in some key measures of core inflation had become increasingly worrisome
2001-05-15;2001;May;Minute;Negative;0.9936621189117432;members also expressed concern about the potential implications for us expansion from developments abroad
2001-05-15;2001;May;Minute;Positive;0.9832708239555359;stronger growth which could not be ruled out would of course bring inventorysales ratios to desired levels more quickly
2001-05-15;2001;May;Minute;Negative;0.987381100654602;this evaluation assumed continued sluggish growth in final demand during the period immediately ahead
2001-05-15;2001;May;Minute;Negative;0.5521544814109802;in the view of many members the adjustment process might not be substantially completed until much later in the year and could take even longer for hightech firms
2001-05-15;2001;May;Minute;Negative;0.9944625496864319;how long inventory cutbacks would continue to exert a significant drag on the economic expansion remained a key uncertainty in the economic outlook
2001-05-15;2001;May;Minute;Positive;0.9730834364891052;a number of members commented that anecdotal and other evidence suggested that considerable progress already had been made in scaling down unwanted inventories notably of motor vehicles but substantial further progress probably would be needed in hightech industries where sales were still falling
2001-05-15;2001;May;Minute;Negative;0.9928351044654846;to some extent economic difficulties in foreign nations had occurred in concert with softening activity in the united states and notable weakness in world hightech markets along with the downward adjustment in equity prices globally represented a downside risk factor worldwide
2001-05-15;2001;May;Minute;Negative;0.9952285289764404;ongoing efforts to reduce excess inventories were continuing to curb output in manufacturing industries and to restrain growth in overall economic activity
