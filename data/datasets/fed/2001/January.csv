2001-01-03;2001;January;Minute;Negative;0.9842036962509155;while the former still seemed to be the most likely outcome the very recent information on labor markets sales and production business and consumer confidence developments in financial markets and growth in foreign economies suggested that the risks to the economy had shifted rapidly and perceptibly to the downside
2001-01-03;2001;January;Minute;Negative;0.5062925219535828;the question at this juncture was whether the expansion would remain near its recent pace or continue to moderate
2001-01-03;2001;January;Minute;Positive;0.9117679595947266;the deceleration in the economy had occurred from an unsustainably high growth rate in the first half of the year and the resulting containment in demand pressures on resources already had improved the outlook for inflation

2001-01-03;2001;January;Minute;Negative;0.9893180727958679;m3 growth slowed less than that of m2 in november in part because of steppedup issuance of large time deposits as banks reduced their reliance on funding from overseas offices

2001-01-03;2001;January;Minute;Negative;0.9951373934745789;the slowing growth of m2 in october and november following strong expansion in august and september apparently reflected the moderating rates of increase in nominal income and spending in recent months and perhaps some persisting effects of the rise in opportunity costs earlier in the year
2001-01-03;2001;January;Minute;Negative;0.9916713237762451;as a result growth of spending on consumer durables was expected to be appreciably below that in recent quarters and housing demand to be slightly weaker

2001-01-03;2001;January;Minute;Positive;0.9884076714515686;at the same time nonresidential construction activity appeared to have been well maintained in many parts of the country though there were reports of softening in some regions and of some reductions or delays in planned projects
2001-01-03;2001;January;Minute;Negative;0.9922463297843933;the profitability of using and producing such software and equipment had been overestimated to a degree and disappointing sales and a better appreciation of risks had resulted in much slower growth in production of such equipment and sharp deterioration in the equity prices of hightech companies
2001-01-03;2001;January;Minute;Neutral;0.9181714653968811;the reevaluation of prospects was most pronounced in the hightech industries

2001-01-03;2001;January;Minute;Negative;0.9939898252487183;in the aggregate cutbacks in inventory investment or runoffs of existing inventories accounted for a significant part of the recent moderation in the growth of the overall economy

2001-01-03;2001;January;Minute;Positive;0.9779109358787537;the extent to which such developments would persist and perhaps foster more aggressive retrenchment in consumer spending clearly was uncertain but the members nonetheless anticipated that over time underlying employment and income trends would be consistent with further expansion in consumer expenditures though at a pace well below that of earlier in the year
2001-01-03;2001;January;Minute;Negative;0.5546401143074036;even so business contacts reported currently undesired levels of inventories in a range of industries not only in motor vehicles

2001-01-31;2001;January;Minute;Neutral;0.622319221496582;the vote encompassed approval of the sentence below for inclusion in the press statement to be released shortly after the meeting against the background of its longrun goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available the committee believes that the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future
2001-01-31;2001;January;Minute;Negative;0.9564970135688782;there were some related indications that wage pressures might be easing
2001-01-31;2001;January;Minute;Neutral;0.9620475172996521;to further its longrun objectives the committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with reducing the federal funds rate to an average of around 512 percent
2001-01-31;2001;January;Minute;Negative;0.9846100807189941;but with the adjustments to the stock of capital consumer durable goods and inventories to more sustainable levels likely only partly completed and with investors in financial markets remaining skittish the risks that growth would persist below that of the economys productivityenhanced potential continued to dominate the outlook
2001-01-31;2001;January;Minute;Neutral;0.8339306116104126;in this regard some members commented that the upside risks could not be totally dismissed
2001-01-31;2001;January;Minute;Positive;0.9915679097175598;the members saw substantial underlying strength and resilience in the economy and they remained optimistic about its prospects beyond the near term in light of the monetary policy stimulus that was being implemented and the persistence of rapid advances in productivity
2001-01-31;2001;January;Minute;Negative;0.5287230610847473;all the members agreed that the balance of risks sentence in the press statement to be released shortly after this meeting should continue to indicate that the risks would remain tilted toward economic weakness even after todays easing action
2001-01-31;2001;January;Minute;Negative;0.9919973015785217;in current circumstances members saw little inflation risk in such a frontloaded easing policy given the reduced pressures on resources stemming from the sluggish performance of the economy and relatively subdued expectations of inflation
2001-01-31;2001;January;Minute;Neutral;0.9461013674736023;as a consequence monetary policy reactions to shifts in economic trends needed in this view to be undertaken more aggressively and completed sooner than in the past
2001-01-31;2001;January;Minute;Positive;0.9517988562583923;several members observed that the evolving nature of the domestic economy including the ongoing improvements in inventory management and the increase in managerial flexibility to alter the level and mix of capital equipment associated in part with the greater availability of information appeared to have fostered relatively prompt adjustments by businesses to changing economic conditions
2001-01-31;2001;January;Minute;Positive;0.9903040528297424;the extent and duration of the current economic correction remained uncertain but the stimulus provided by the committees policy easing actions would help guard against cumulative weakness in economic activity and would support the positive factors that seemed likely to promote recovery later in the year
2001-01-31;2001;January;Minute;Negative;0.9866098761558533;such a policy move in conjunction with the 50 basis point reduction in early january would represent a relatively aggressive policy adjustment in a short period of time but the members agreed on its desirability in light of the rapid weakening in the economic expansion in recent months and associated deterioration in business and consumer confidence
2001-01-31;2001;January;Minute;Neutral;0.794142484664917;in the committees discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead all the members endorsed a proposal calling for a further easing in reserve conditions consistent with a 50 basis point decrease in the federal funds rate to a level of 512 percent
2001-01-31;2001;January;Minute;Negative;0.9701116681098938;other factors included the prospect of some decline in energy prices and the persistence of generally benign inflation expectations
2001-01-31;2001;January;Minute;Positive;0.9889233112335205;a key factor in this assessment continued to be their outlook for rapid further gains in structural productivity that would help to hold down increases in unit labor costs
2001-01-31;2001;January;Minute;Neutral;0.8078758716583252;at the conclusion of this discussion the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york until it was instructed otherwise to execute transactions in the system account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output

2001-01-31;2001;January;Minute;Negative;0.9920204281806946;on balance with pressures in labor and product markets ebbing the outlook for inflation was a source of diminished though persisting concern
2001-01-31;2001;January;Minute;Neutral;0.9771385192871094;except for prices of energy and medical services the currently available information indicated relatively subdued rates of inflation and recent surveys pointed to little change in inflation expectations
2001-01-31;2001;January;Minute;Neutral;0.9905042052268982;open market operations during the intermeeting period were initially directed toward maintaining the federal funds rate at the committees targeted level of 612 percent
2001-01-31;2001;January;Minute;Neutral;0.9914016127586365;if however incoming data were to reinforce the recent anecdotal indications the committee would be prepared to respond promptly
2001-01-31;2001;January;Minute;Negative;0.95704185962677;as a result most members believed that it would be prudent to await further confirmation of a noticeably weaker expansion before implementing any monetary easing particularly given the current high level of resource utilization and the record over the last several years of strong rebounds from brief lulls in growth
2001-01-31;2001;January;Minute;Positive;0.9713338613510132;indeed very recent information seemed to signal sudden further weakness but it was largely anecdotal and most of the aggregate data on spending and employment suggested continued economic expansion albeit at a relatively slow rate
2001-01-31;2001;January;Minute;Negative;0.9924554824829102;at the same time however the members concluded that the balance of risks had shifted sufficiently that they were now weighted toward conditions that could generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future
2001-01-31;2001;January;Minute;Neutral;0.9891400337219238;at its meeting on december 19 2000 the committee adopted a directive that continued to call for maintaining conditions in reserve markets consistent with an unchanged federal funds rate of about 612 percent

2001-01-31;2001;January;Minute;Positive;0.9447126388549805;however growth of eci compensation picked up somewhat in 2000 from 1999 probably owing in large part to the upward trend in productivity growth
2001-01-31;2001;January;Minute;Neutral;0.662681519985199;with regard to labor costs the employment cost index of hourly compensation for private industry workers eci decelerated noticeably in the fourth quarter with both the wage and benefit components recording smaller gains
2001-01-31;2001;January;Minute;Negative;0.8184100985527039;at the producer level core prices edged up over the novemberdecember period and the rise in core prices over the year was minimal as well

2001-01-31;2001;January;Minute;Neutral;0.5576238036155701;however information that became available in the weeks after the december meeting tended to confirm the earlier indications of weakness in spending and at a telephone conference on january 3 2001 the committee approved a 12 percentage point reduction in the federal funds rate to 6 percent and also agreed that the risks remained weighted toward economic weakness
2001-01-31;2001;January;Minute;Neutral;0.9834303855895996;by most measures price inflation had remained moderate in recent months

2001-01-31;2001;January;Minute;Negative;0.9622161388397217;as a result the aggregate stocksales ratio for the manufacturing sector continued its upward drift that began early last year
2001-01-31;2001;January;Minute;Negative;0.9332928657531738;looking ahead members anticipated that somewhat reduced pressures in labor and product markets would foster some softening in consumer price inflation over coming quarters a development that would be abetted should prices of oil and natural gas ease during the year in line with current market expectations
2001-01-31;2001;January;Minute;Negative;0.9946558475494385;despite production cutbacks stockbuilding in manufacturing remained rapid and sizable inventory overhangs had emerged in some industries particularly those related to the motor vehicle sector

2001-01-31;2001;January;Minute;Negative;0.9915844202041626;energy prices remained elevated and were continuing to depress business and household purchasing power the overhang of excess capital stocks in some sectors could turn out to be sizable depressing investment spending for some time consumer confidence could worsen appreciably more in the face of weaker expansion of incomes and higher job layoffs and investor concerns about earnings could increase further sparking lower equity prices and tighter standards and terms on credit
2001-01-31;2001;January;Minute;Negative;0.9939006567001343;at the same time members also saw considerable downside risks to the economic expansion

2001-01-31;2001;January;Minute;Positive;0.6846446990966797;perhaps the most critical element in this outlook was the persistence of elevated growth in structural labor productivity which seemed likely to play a vital role in supporting growth in incomes and aggregate demand while also helping to limit inflation pressures
2001-01-31;2001;January;Minute;Positive;0.9899667501449585;a decline in energy prices should it materialize as anticipated in futures markets would have a positive effect on both business and consumer spending by lowering business costs and raising disposable consumer incomes adjusted for energy costs
2001-01-31;2001;January;Minute;Positive;0.9920576214790344;the prospect that fiscal policy might begin to move in an expansionary direction later in the year was cited as another factor in the outlook for stronger economic activity
2001-01-31;2001;January;Minute;Positive;0.8577466607093811;some also observed that counter to the experience generally associated with the onset of earlier recessions monetary growth had been well maintained in recent months and a few noted that longterm interest rates currently were appreciably below their peaks of the past year
2001-01-31;2001;January;Minute;Positive;0.9819254875183105;several commented that the sound condition of the banking system was another supportive factor

2001-01-31;2001;January;Minute;Negative;0.8179917931556702;in particular it was unclear whether the pause in the economic expansion would be largely limited to a relatively short inventory correction or would involve a more extensive cyclical adjustment
2001-01-31;2001;January;Minute;Negative;0.9723603129386902;the eventual degree and duration of the softening in economic conditions were difficult to predict
2001-01-31;2001;January;Minute;Negative;0.9950878024101257;this weakening which was especially evident in durable goods producing industries had led to large cutbacks in manufacturing output as numerous business firms attempted to pare what they now viewed as excessive inventories
2001-01-31;2001;January;Minute;Negative;0.9936391711235046;consumer spending and business capital investment had decelerated markedly partly in association with a sharp decline in consumer and business confidence

2001-01-31;2001;January;Minute;Positive;0.9909853935241699;the pickup in m2 growth evidently reflected a flight from heightened equity market volatility late last year to the safety and liquidity of m2 assets along with a recent narrowing of the opportunity costs of holding funds in m2 accounts

2001-01-31;2001;January;Minute;Negative;0.9897011518478394;the dollar posted a small gain against an index of the currencies of other important trading partners largely reflecting expectations that some emerging economies might be adversely affected by slower growth in the united states

2001-01-31;2001;January;Minute;Negative;0.9924764037132263;however that decline was roughly counterbalanced by a rise in the dollar against the yen reflecting continuing economic stagnation in japan
2001-01-31;2001;January;Minute;Positive;0.990047812461853;m3 grew even faster than m2 boosted in part by steppedup issuance of large time deposits to fund a pickup in bank credit
2001-01-31;2001;January;Minute;Positive;0.8636054396629333;the expansion of domestic nonfinancial debt increased in november and december latest data reflecting greater business borrowing perhaps to finance growing inventories and smaller contractions in the amount of federal debt outstanding
2001-01-31;2001;January;Minute;Negative;0.9938027858734131;the dollar lost ground against the euro as market participants took note of the deterioration of nearterm prospects for economic growth in the united states relative to those for europe
2001-01-31;2001;January;Minute;Positive;0.9671990275382996;the staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that after a pause associated in part with an inventory correction the economic expansion would regain strength over the next two years and gradually move to a rate near the staffs current estimate of the growth of the economys potential output
2001-01-31;2001;January;Minute;Negative;0.9813125729560852;the period of subpar activity was expected to foster an appreciable slackening of resource utilization and some moderation in core price inflation
2001-01-31;2001;January;Minute;Negative;0.7817031145095825;the forecast anticipated that the expansion of domestic final demand would be held back to some extent by the decline in household net worth associated with the downturn that had occurred in equity prices the remaining effects of prior monetary restraint and the continuation of somewhat stringent credit terms and conditions on some types of loans by financial institutions
2001-01-31;2001;January;Minute;Negative;0.7915078401565552;as a result growth of spending on consumer durables was expected to be appreciably below that of the first half of last year and housing demand to be about unchanged from its recent level
2001-01-31;2001;January;Minute;Positive;0.9159992933273315;business fixed investment notably outlays for equipment and software was projected to resume relatively robust growth after a comparatively brief period of adjustment of capital stocks to more desirable levels growth abroad was seen as supporting the expansion of us exports and fiscal policy was assumed to become more expansionary
