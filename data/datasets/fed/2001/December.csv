2001-12-11;2001;December;Minute;Positive;0.9369587898254395;anecdotal reports provided some support for such an outlook including widespread indications that retail inventories were already at quite lean levels even outside the motor vehicle sector

2001-12-11;2001;December;Minute;Negative;0.991588294506073;in the view of one member policy was already sufficiently stimulative and the outlook improved enough to warrant a pause to assess further developments
2001-12-11;2001;December;Minute;Positive;0.5854400992393494;at the same time members emphasized that the stance of policy was already quite accommodative that much of the effects of recent easings had yet to be felt and that tentative signs suggested the economy and the economic outlook were beginning to stabilize
2001-12-11;2001;December;Minute;Negative;0.9880571365356445;the risk that a policy reversal should it prove to be needed in the near term would foster significant market unsettlement seemed limited in light of widespread expectations of some further easing at this meeting to be followed by a policy turnaround next year
2001-12-11;2001;December;Minute;Positive;0.6609921455383301;if a modest easing action taken today turned out to be unneeded the committee would have ample opportunity to reverse its action without incurring any real risk of allowing inflationary pressures to gather momentum given the projected degree of slack in resource use and the current absence of significant inflationary pressures
2001-12-11;2001;December;Minute;Negative;0.9844892024993896;in these circumstances the consequences of inactivity at this meeting could turn out to be considerable and several members viewed an easing action as a measure of insurance against the potential for greater or more prolonged economic weakness than they currently anticipated
2001-12-11;2001;December;Minute;Neutral;0.5164428353309631;given their views about the risks to the economy the members supported the retention of the sentence in the press statement to be released shortly after this meeting indicating that the risks continued to be weighted mainly toward conditions that could foster economic weakness in the foreseeable future

2001-12-11;2001;December;Minute;Negative;0.927731454372406;in these circumstances several saw a decision to ease as a close call but they favored it on balance given their weighting of the possible consequences should restraining forces in the economy persist to a greater extent than they currently expected
2001-12-11;2001;December;Minute;Negative;0.9937740564346313;some members reported that higher insurance costs since the september 11 terrorist attacks were exerting an inhibiting effect on some nonresidential construction activity in their regions
2001-12-11;2001;December;Minute;Positive;0.987235963344574;nonetheless with the critical consumer sector holding up relatively well thus far members continued to anticipate an upturn in the economy during the year ahead in light of the progress already made by business firms in reducing excess inventories and unwinding capital overhangs and the beneficial effects of the decline of energy prices
2001-12-11;2001;December;Minute;Negative;0.9765830039978027;among those risks members cited the apparently reduced prospects for additional fiscal stimulus legislation the vulnerability of current stock market valuations should forecasts of a robust rebound in earnings fail to materialize the possibility of further terrorist incidents and especially the potentially adverse effect on consumer confidence and spending of additional deterioration in labor market conditions
2001-12-11;2001;December;Minute;Negative;0.9674872756004333;the members agreed however that the evidence of emerging stabilization in the economy remained quite tentative and the timing and strength of the eventual recovery continued to be surrounded by a high degree of uncertainty with the risks to the economy still clearly tilted toward economic weakness
2001-12-11;2001;December;Minute;Negative;0.9883543252944946;the recent statistical and anecdotal information was more mixed than had been the case earlier and pointed on balance toward some moderation in the decline of overall final demand for the first time in a long while the incoming data did not call for a downward revision to current forecasts
2001-12-11;2001;December;Minute;Neutral;0.8830896615982056;the decline in inventories was likely to abate before long boosting production but the course of a recovery would depend on the behavior of final demand

2001-12-11;2001;December;Minute;Neutral;0.5520737171173096;the recovery would be supported in part by the cumulative easing that had occurred in the stance of monetary policy along with the fiscal stimulus already in place and some assumed additional measures not yet enacted

2001-12-11;2001;December;Minute;Positive;0.9107689261436462;the turnaround in the economy and the gradual strengthening of the recovery would also be fostered by the completion of downward adjustments to inventories a marked slowing in the contraction of business capital investments and the added purchasing power arising from the recent declines in oil prices
