2001-10-02;2001;October;Minute;Positive;0.9889360070228577;other supportive elements included a likely rebound in business hightech investment after its sharp retrenchment and a gradual turnaround in inventory investment as stocks became better aligned with expected sales
2001-10-02;2001;October;Minute;Positive;0.9911583065986633;the members nonetheless saw favorable prospects for an upturn in business activity next year though the recovery clearly would be more delayed than they had anticipated before september 11 major reasons for optimism about the outlook were the substantial easing in monetary policy whose lagged effects would be felt increasingly in the year ahead and the fiscal stimulus measures that already had been enacted and might well be supplemented over coming months
2001-10-02;2001;October;Minute;Negative;0.9903448224067688;in these circumstances a substantial further drop in consumer and business confidence and spending could not be ruled out
2001-10-02;2001;October;Minute;Negative;0.980258584022522;the major question at this point was the extent to which the recent tragedies would continue to weigh on consumer spending and business investment
2001-10-02;2001;October;Minute;Negative;0.9852177500724792;the confluence of worldwide economic weakness added to current uncertainties and concerns
2001-10-02;2001;October;Minute;Negative;0.9674051403999329;it was especially difficult to assess the outlook for consumer sentiment and spending in the period immediately ahead which likely would depend to an important extent on the progress of the war against terrorism and reactions to any further terrorist activities
2001-10-02;2001;October;Minute;Negative;0.9933785200119019;in the short period since the attacks anecdotal reports provided indications of a rebound from the sharp cutback in spending that characterized the immediate aftermath of those tragic events but on balance business activity seemed to be in the process of moving lower
2001-10-02;2001;October;Minute;Negative;0.9932622313499451;the economy appeared to have been growing very little if at all prior to the terrorist attacks and the dislocations arising from the latter seemed to have induced a downturn in overall economic activity against the backdrop of heightened anxiety and uncertainty about economic prospects and a sharp drop at least initially in stock prices after the equity markets reopened on september 17 looking ahead the members generally saw a relatively mild and short contraction followed by a gradual recovery next year as a plausible forecast but one that was subject to an unusually wide range of uncertainty notably in the direction of a potentially much weaker outcome in the nearer term
2001-10-02;2001;October;Minute;Negative;0.823600709438324;in the committees discussion of current and prospective economic developments the members focused on the shock to consumer and business confidence occasioned by the events of september 11 and the adverse repercussions on an already weak economy
2001-10-02;2001;October;Minute;Negative;0.9650692939758301;the current and prospective slack in resource use over coming quarters augmented by the passthrough effects of lower oil prices would result in some modest deceleration in core pce and cpi inflation
2001-10-02;2001;October;Minute;Negative;0.8863072395324707;with a few shortlived exceptions production on the whole had not been directly disrupted by the effects of the terrorist attacks
2001-10-02;2001;October;Minute;Negative;0.9903175830841064;one risk bearing on that outlook was the possibility that prices in equity markets might continue to decline and perhaps even overadjust to lower earnings expectations
2001-10-02;2001;October;Minute;Negative;0.994499683380127;in the consumer sector spending had with some exceptions held up well through late summer but confidence had begun to deteriorate even before september 11 a factor that seemed to be exerting an increasingly depressing effect on consumer attitudes was the persisting stream of worker layoffs and rising unemployment
2001-10-02;2001;October;Minute;Positive;0.9835653901100159;the recovery would gather momentum during 2002 to a pace late in the year near the staffs current estimate of the growth in the economys potential
2001-10-02;2001;October;Minute;Negative;0.9929186701774597;retail sales along with expenditures associated with travelrelated services had fallen dramatically in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks
2001-10-02;2001;October;Minute;Negative;0.9908192753791809;the adverse wealth effects stemming from the cumulative declines in stock market prices were a further negative though one that had been cushioned by continued increases in the value of real estate
2001-10-02;2001;October;Minute;Positive;0.9623323678970337;looking further ahead however a robust upturn in business capital spending was still a probable outcome
2001-10-02;2001;October;Minute;Negative;0.9944524168968201;reports from banking contacts also indicated a substantial drop in demand for business loans that was attributed in part to the diminished willingness of small businesses in particular to undertake new investments in capital equipment and other production facilities
2001-10-02;2001;October;Minute;Negative;0.9936802387237549;while nationwide statistics on expenditures in the period since the terrorist attacks were not yet available anecdotal reports pointed to especially large cutbacks in planned spending for commercial aircraft and rental cars stemming from the sudden and sharp deterioration of activity in the travel and tourist industries
2001-10-02;2001;October;Minute;Negative;0.9955741167068481;according to contacts intensified concerns about prospects for sales and profits were depressing investment further by fostering an increasingly widespread waitandsee attitude about undertaking new investment expenditures
2001-10-02;2001;October;Minute;Negative;0.9895817041397095;spending for equipment and software and for commercial structures had been declining sharply through the summer with only a few tentative signs that the pace of decline might be about to ebb
2001-10-02;2001;October;Minute;Negative;0.9928855299949646;the events of september 11 produced a marked increase in uncertainty and anxiety among contacts in the business sector
2001-10-02;2001;October;Minute;Negative;0.9941459894180298;more generally the increase in uncertainty and the decline in business confidence and corporate profits along with the currently high levels of excess capacity in many industries pointed to the persistence of poor prospects for capital spending over the short to intermediate term with declines in outlays for hightech products expected to remain especially pronounced
2001-10-02;2001;October;Minute;Negative;0.9808027744293213;some members noted in this regard that they sensed growing caution among homebuilders
2001-10-02;2001;October;Minute;Negative;0.9929749965667725;the nearterm outlook suggested some further waning in housing demand in association with the prospective weakness in employment and income
2001-10-02;2001;October;Minute;Negative;0.9660800099372864;housing demand had remained at a relatively elevated level across much of the nation though signs of some softening were apparent prior to september 11 especially in the highpriced segment of the housing market
2001-10-02;2001;October;Minute;Neutral;0.9063403010368347;even so the members did not rule out a strongerthananticipated pickup later depending in part on the size of additional fiscal policy actions
2001-10-02;2001;October;Minute;Negative;0.967955470085144;there were no historical precedents for judging the likely effects on consumer confidence and spending of the unique recent events though it seemed likely that prospects for added job losses and the decline in equity wealth already experienced would hold down consumer expenditures over the months ahead
2001-10-02;2001;October;Minute;Negative;0.99397873878479;looking ahead many retailer contacts anticipated sluggish sales over coming months
2001-10-02;2001;October;Minute;Positive;0.9900776147842407;however the outlook for housing activity over the intermediate to longer term remained fairly promising against the backdrop of relatively low mortgage interest rates and a prospective recovery in overall economic activity that would foster rising employment and incomes
2001-10-02;2001;October;Minute;Positive;0.9898826479911804;very recent anecdotal reports suggested some improvement in consumer spending though not a total recovery with mixed indications ranging from a rebound to levels near preattack norms to still relatively depressed activity
