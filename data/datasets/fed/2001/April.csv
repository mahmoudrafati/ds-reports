2001-04-11;2001;April;Minute;Negative;0.49977830052375793;however some commented that the amount of financial stimulus was much smaller than might otherwise be expected from policy easing of this cumulative amount because it had been accompanied by further declines in stock market prices more stringent financing terms for many business borrowers and a stronger dollar all of which would be holding down domestic spending and production
2001-04-11;2001;April;Minute;Negative;0.9921918511390686;indeed financial markets had come to place some odds on a larger move of 75 basis points in recent days importantly reflecting the possibility of a presumed policy response to the sizable declines in equity prices that had occurred as earnings prospects proved disappointing

2001-04-11;2001;April;Minute;Negative;0.9840918779373169;the members agreed that even with a further 50 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate the risks to the economy would remain decidedly to the downside
2001-04-11;2001;April;Minute;Neutral;0.9853620529174805;this conclusion would be reflected in the press statement to be released after todays meeting
2001-04-11;2001;April;Minute;Neutral;0.9688688516616821;the statement also would emphasize the need for close monitoring of rapidly evolving economic conditions
2001-04-11;2001;April;Minute;Neutral;0.9783947467803955;the members anticipated that in the relatively long interval before the next regularly scheduled meeting on may 15 2001 economic developments might suggest the desirability of a committee conference call to assess business conditions across the nation and to consider the possible need for a further policy adjustment
2001-04-11;2001;April;Minute;Neutral;0.8078758716583252;at the conclusion of this discussion the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york until it was instructed otherwise to execute transactions in the system account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output

2001-04-11;2001;April;Minute;Positive;0.7803913354873657;the period of subpar expansion was expected to foster an appreciable easing of pressures on resources and some moderation in core price inflation
2001-04-11;2001;April;Minute;Neutral;0.9829890131950378;while many of the members generally believed that additional policy easing might well prove to be necessary at some time the easing favored by most members incorporated what they viewed as an adequate degree of stimulus under current economic conditions and represented an appropriately calibrated step given the uncertainties in the economic outlook
2001-04-11;2001;April;Minute;Positive;0.9900234341621399;it was noted that homebuilders were generally optimistic about the prospects for the year ahead given their current backlogs and expectations of further growth in employment and incomes
2001-04-11;2001;April;Minute;Negative;0.9894326329231262;business investment would be held back by lower earnings expectations and a capital overhang of unknown dimensions consumption was subject to downside risks from previous decreases in equity wealth and declining confidence and the strong dollar and weaker foreign growth would constrain exports
2001-04-11;2001;April;Minute;Negative;0.5775558352470398;housing activity was generally holding up well across the country as the effects of appreciably reduced mortgage interest rates apparently compensated for the negative effects of declining financial wealth on the demand for housing
2001-04-11;2001;April;Minute;Negative;0.9945002794265747;while housing construction was generally described as elevated some members referred to overbuilding or weakness in some local housing markets
2001-04-11;2001;April;Minute;Negative;0.9942400455474854;as a result growth of spending on consumer durables was expected to be appreciably below the rapid pace in the first half of last year and housing demand would increase only a little from its recent level

2001-04-11;2001;April;Minute;Negative;0.8498300909996033;these positive developments needed to be weighed against an appreciable weakening in business investment spending and the nearterm restraining effects of a drawdown in inventories

2001-04-18;2001;April;Minute;Negative;0.9909961223602295;inflation was likely to be damped by ebbing pressures on labor and product markets
2001-04-18;2001;April;Minute;Neutral;0.9829890131950378;while many of the members generally believed that additional policy easing might well prove to be necessary at some time the easing favored by most members incorporated what they viewed as an adequate degree of stimulus under current economic conditions and represented an appropriately calibrated step given the uncertainties in the economic outlook
2001-04-18;2001;April;Minute;Neutral;0.9554052352905273;the dollar also posted a small gain against an index of the currencies of other important trading partners
2001-04-18;2001;April;Minute;Neutral;0.9288923144340515;votes for this action
2001-04-18;2001;April;Minute;Neutral;0.622319221496582;the vote encompassed approval of the sentence below for inclusion in the press statement to be released shortly after the meeting against the background of its longrun goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available the committee believes that the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future
2001-04-18;2001;April;Minute;Neutral;0.955707311630249;to further its longrun objectives the committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with reducing the federal funds rate to an average of around 5 percent
2001-04-18;2001;April;Minute;Neutral;0.8078758716583252;at the conclusion of this discussion the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york until it was instructed otherwise to execute transactions in the system account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output
2001-04-18;2001;April;Minute;Neutral;0.9783947467803955;the members anticipated that in the relatively long interval before the next regularly scheduled meeting on may 15 2001 economic developments might suggest the desirability of a committee conference call to assess business conditions across the nation and to consider the possible need for a further policy adjustment
2001-04-18;2001;April;Minute;Neutral;0.9688688516616821;the statement also would emphasize the need for close monitoring of rapidly evolving economic conditions
2001-04-18;2001;April;Minute;Neutral;0.9853620529174805;this conclusion would be reflected in the press statement to be released after todays meeting
2001-04-18;2001;April;Minute;Negative;0.9840918779373169;the members agreed that even with a further 50 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate the risks to the economy would remain decidedly to the downside
2001-04-18;2001;April;Minute;Positive;0.5656973123550415;in their view a more forceful action was justified by current and prospective economic conditions
2001-04-18;2001;April;Minute;Neutral;0.9344074130058289;a few members expressed a preference for a 75 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate
2001-04-18;2001;April;Minute;Neutral;0.9821836948394775;most members agreed however that in the context of their focus on the economy smaller possibly more frequent policy adjustments were appropriate to afford them the opportunity to recalibrate policy in rapidly changing and highly uncertain circumstances
2001-04-18;2001;April;Minute;Negative;0.9921918511390686;indeed financial markets had come to place some odds on a larger move of 75 basis points in recent days importantly reflecting the possibility of a presumed policy response to the sizable declines in equity prices that had occurred as earnings prospects proved disappointing
2001-04-18;2001;April;Minute;Negative;0.49977830052375793;however some commented that the amount of financial stimulus was much smaller than might otherwise be expected from policy easing of this cumulative amount because it had been accompanied by further declines in stock market prices more stringent financing terms for many business borrowers and a stronger dollar all of which would be holding down domestic spending and production
2001-04-18;2001;April;Minute;Negative;0.5650491118431091;it was noted in this regard that in combination with the two easing actions earlier this year the committee would have implemented in a relatively short period a considerable amount of monetary easing whose economic effects would be felt over time
2001-04-18;2001;April;Minute;Negative;0.9945002794265747;while housing construction was generally described as elevated some members referred to overbuilding or weakness in some local housing markets
2001-04-18;2001;April;Minute;Negative;0.5775558352470398;housing activity was generally holding up well across the country as the effects of appreciably reduced mortgage interest rates apparently compensated for the negative effects of declining financial wealth on the demand for housing
2001-04-18;2001;April;Minute;Positive;0.7231097221374512;in the committees discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead most of the members preferred and all could support a further easing of reserve conditions consistent with a 50 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate to 5 percent
2001-04-18;2001;April;Minute;Neutral;0.9268233776092529;on balance business spending for plant and equipment was likely to pick up only gradually this year
2001-04-18;2001;April;Minute;Negative;0.9953188300132751;however the members saw clear downside risks in the outlook for consumer and investment spending in the context of the marked decline that had occurred in equity prices and consumer confidence and in expected business profitability and they were concerned that weaker exports might also hold down the expansion of economic activity
2001-04-18;2001;April;Minute;Positive;0.9923406839370728;they noted a number of favorable underlying factors that would tend to support a rebound including solid productivity growth stable low inflation generally sound financial institutions lower interest rates and relatively robust expansion in many measures of money
2001-04-18;2001;April;Minute;Positive;0.9851240515708923;beyond the inventory correction the members continued to anticipate an acceleration of the expansion over time though likely on a more delayed basis and at a more gradual pace than they had forecast earlier
2001-04-18;2001;April;Minute;Neutral;0.9524335265159607;looking ahead while sales and production data suggested that excess inventories were being worked off the adjustment did not appear to have been completed
2001-04-18;2001;April;Minute;Negative;0.8498300909996033;these positive developments needed to be weighed against an appreciable weakening in business investment spending and the nearterm restraining effects of a drawdown in inventories
2001-04-18;2001;April;Minute;Positive;0.9902742505073547;members noted that consumer spending had strengthened early in the year and housing activity had remained at a relatively high level
2001-04-18;2001;April;Minute;Negative;0.9940208792686462;in the committees discussion of current and prospective economic developments members commented that the recent statistical and anecdotal information had been mixed but they viewed evolving business conditions as consistent on the whole with a continued softness in economic activity
2001-04-18;2001;April;Minute;Positive;0.8855687975883484;business fixed investment notably outlays for equipment and software was projected to resume relatively robust growth after a period of adjustment of capital stocks to more desirable levels growth abroad was seen as supporting the expansion of us exports and fiscal policy was assumed to become more expansionary
2001-04-18;2001;April;Minute;Negative;0.9942400455474854;as a result growth of spending on consumer durables was expected to be appreciably below the rapid pace in the first half of last year and housing demand would increase only a little from its recent level
2001-04-18;2001;April;Minute;Negative;0.9139885306358337;the forecast anticipated that the expansion of domestic final demand would be held back to an extent by the decline in household net worth associated with the downturn that had occurred in equity prices the lingering effects of last years relatively high interest rates and the continuation of relatively stringent terms and conditions on some types of loans by financial institutions
2001-04-18;2001;April;Minute;Positive;0.7803913354873657;the period of subpar expansion was expected to foster an appreciable easing of pressures on resources and some moderation in core price inflation
2001-04-18;2001;April;Minute;Positive;0.9618632793426514;the staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that after a period of slow growth associated in part with an inventory correction the economic expansion would gradually regain strength over the next two years and move toward a rate near the staffs current estimate of the growth of the economys potential output
2001-04-18;2001;April;Minute;Negative;0.9930968880653381;growth of domestic nonfinancial debt decelerated noticeably in january latest data reflecting reduced expansion of debt in the nonfederal sectors coupled with a larger contraction in the amount of federal debt outstanding
2001-04-18;2001;April;Minute;Positive;0.7844013571739197;over the longer term however a return to more robust business investment seemed likely and indeed business earnings forecasts beyond the nearer term had not declined very much reflecting continuing expectations of substantial profit opportunities related to persisting strong gains in productivity
2001-04-18;2001;April;Minute;Positive;0.9712958335876465;the strength in m2 was concentrated in its liquid components apparently in response to the further narrowing of opportunity costs the yield advantage of money funds relative to longerterm investments and the appeal of a safe haven from volatile equity markets
2001-04-18;2001;April;Minute;Neutral;0.5126986503601074;with regard to the outlook for inflation some recent measures of increases in core prices had fluctuated on the high side of earlier expectations but apart from energy prices and medical costs inflation was still relatively quiescent
2001-04-18;2001;April;Minute;Negative;0.990126371383667;with the growth in output likely to remain below the expansion of the economys potential for a while members anticipated that inflation would remain subdued
2001-04-18;2001;April;Minute;Negative;0.9884181618690491;m3 grew somewhat less rapidly than m2 a pullback in the issuance of bankmanaged liabilities particularly large time deposits was associated with slower expansion of bank credit
2001-04-18;2001;April;Minute;Positive;0.9925143122673035;at the same time the information available for the first quarter indicated considerable strength in nonresidential construction activity including large outlays on public sector infrastructure projects in some areas
2001-04-18;2001;April;Minute;Negative;0.9938446283340454;mirroring the statistics for the nation as a whole business conditions in different parts of the country displayed mixed industry patterns but members reported that overall business activity currently appeared to be growing at a sluggish pace in most regions and business contacts were exhibiting a heightened sense of caution or even concern in some industries
2001-04-18;2001;April;Minute;Negative;0.8742010593414307;moreover those earlier very substantial investment outlays seemed to have created excess capacity in a number of industries and how large an adjustment in spending for business equipment might now be underway was still unclear especially with regard to hightech industries
2001-04-18;2001;April;Minute;Negative;0.9866630434989929;the capital stock had grown at an unsustainable pace for a time so some downshifting in investment was inevitable
2001-04-18;2001;April;Minute;Negative;0.6343291997909546;as a consequence a substantial volume of planned investment was being postponed if not cancelled
2001-04-18;2001;April;Minute;Negative;0.9952291250228882;substantial downward adjustments to expected nearterm business earnings had persisted suggesting that firms saw investment as much less profitable than they had before and that cash flows would be constrained
2001-04-18;2001;April;Minute;Negative;0.9943110942840576;spending for equipment and software declined in the fourth quarter and the available statistical and anecdotal reports pointed to weakness during the first half of this year largely reflecting developments in hightech industries
2001-04-18;2001;April;Minute;Negative;0.887122392654419;another major source of downside risk to the expansion was business fixed investment
2001-04-18;2001;April;Minute;Negative;0.994222104549408;many businesses also were inhibited in their investment activities by less accommodative financial conditions associated with weaker equity markets and tighter credit terms and conditions imposed by banking institutions
2001-04-18;2001;April;Minute;Negative;0.9899511933326721;how this divergence might eventually be resolved was a significant source of uncertainty and downside risk
2001-04-18;2001;April;Minute;Positive;0.6318023800849915;to date however overall consumer spending had remained relatively strong and seemingly at odds with measures of consumer confidence and reduced equity wealth
2001-04-18;2001;April;Minute;Negative;0.9844257831573486;against this background consumers might well endeavor to boost their savings and even a fairly small increase in what currently was a quite low saving rate would have large damping effects on aggregate demand that could weaken if not abort the expansion
2001-04-18;2001;April;Minute;Negative;0.940282940864563;members also referred to the retarding effects on consumer expenditures of elevated levels of household debt and high energy costs
2001-04-18;2001;April;Minute;Negative;0.991028368473053;downside risks cited by the members included the substantial declines that had already occurred in measures of consumer confidence and equity wealth and the possibility that consumer sentiment might be undermined even further by continued volatility and additional declines in the stock market and by rising concerns about job losses amid persistent announcements of layoffs
2001-04-18;2001;April;Minute;Positive;0.9933033585548401;in their review of developments in key sectors of the economy members indicated that they saw favorable prospects for continued moderate growth in consumer expenditures though considerable uncertainty surrounded this outlook
2001-04-18;2001;April;Minute;Positive;0.9703360795974731;on balance while there were reasons to be concerned about the outlook for consumer spending members believed that recent spending trends and the outlook for further growth in employment and incomes pointed to continued expansion in this key sector of the economy though likely at a relatively sluggish pace
