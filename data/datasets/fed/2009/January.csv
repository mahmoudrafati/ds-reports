2009-01-16;2009;January;Minute;Negative;0.9848048686981201;moreover some noted a risk that expected inflation might actually increase to an undesirably high level if the public does not understand that the federal reserves liquidity facilities will be wound down and its balance sheet will shrink as economic and financial conditions improve
2009-01-16;2009;January;Minute;Neutral;0.9879958033561707;several participants indicated that they thought the fomc should explore establishing quantitative guidelines or targets for a monetary aggregate perhaps the growth rate of the monetary base or m2 in their view such guidelines would provide useful information to the public and help anchor inflation expectations
2009-01-16;2009;January;Minute;Neutral;0.9917396306991577;others were skeptical that a single quantitative measure could adequately convey the federal reserves current approach to monetary policy because the stimulative effect of the federal reserves liquidityproviding and assetpurchase programs depends not only on the scale but also on the mix of lending programs and securities purchases
2009-01-16;2009;January;Minute;Negative;0.9642546772956848;participants agreed that inflation pressures had diminished appreciably in recent quarters and they expected significantly lower headline and core inflation during the next few years than during recent years

2009-01-16;2009;January;Minute;Negative;0.9815308451652527;some participants worried that the outcome could be an increase in defaults on commercial real estate mortgages and forced sales of commercial properties which could push prices down further and generate additional losses on banks commercial real estate loan portfolios
2009-01-16;2009;January;Minute;Negative;0.9857010841369629;for example unless the cuts were clearly perceived to be permanent the boost to consumer spending might prove shortlived as was the case with the tax rebates distributed in the spring of 2008 participants saw no indication that the housing sector was beginning to stabilize
