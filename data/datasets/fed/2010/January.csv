2010-01-27;2010;January;Minute;Neutral;0.9582038521766663;several thought it important to begin a program of asset sales in the near future to ensure that the federal reserves balance sheet shrinks more quickly and in a more predictable manner than could be achieved solely by redeeming maturing securities and not reinvesting prepayments they judged that a program of asset sales spread over a number of years would underscore the committees determination to exit from the period of exceptionally accommodative monetary policy in a manner and at a pace that would keep inflation contained without having large effects on asset prices or market interest rates

2010-01-27;2010;January;Minute;Neutral;0.9776315689086914;the tools for moving to a less accommodative policy stance encompassed 1 raising the interest rate paid on excess reserve balances the ioer rate 2 executing term reverse repurchase agreements with the primary dealers 3 executing term rrps with a broader range of counterparties 4 using a term deposit facility tdf to absorb excess reserves 5 redeeming maturing and prepaid securities held by the federal reserve without reinvesting the proceeds and 6 selling securities held by the federal reserve before they mature
2010-01-27;2010;January;Minute;Neutral;0.953612744808197;all but the first of these tools would shrink the supply of reserve balances the last two would also shrink the federal reserves balance sheet

2010-01-27;2010;January;Minute;Neutral;0.9906325340270996;most thought that it likely would be appropriate to reduce the supply of reserve balances to some extent before the eventual increase in the ioer rate and in the target for the federal funds rate in part because doing so would tighten the link between shortterm market rates and the ioer rate however several noted that draining operations might be seen as a precursor to tightening and should only be undertaken when the committee judged that an increase in its target for the federal funds rate would soon be appropriate
2010-01-27;2010;January;Minute;Neutral;0.6802898049354553;for the same reason a few judged that it would be better to drain reserves concurrently with the eventual increase in the ioer and target rates

2010-01-27;2010;January;Minute;Neutral;0.9258233904838562;staff described several feasible strategies for using these six tools to support a gradual return toward a more normal stance of monetary policy 1 using one or more of the tools to progressively reduce the supply of reserve balanceswhich rose to an exceptionally high level as a consequence of the expansion of the federal reserves liquidity and lending facilities and subsequent largescale asset purchases during the financial crisisbefore raising the ioer rate and the target for the federal funds rate 2 increasing the ioer rate in line with an increase in the federal funds rate target and concurrently using one or more tools to reduce the supply of reserve balances and 3 raising the ioer rate and the target for the federal funds rate and using reserve draining tools only if the federal funds rate did not increase in line with the committees target
