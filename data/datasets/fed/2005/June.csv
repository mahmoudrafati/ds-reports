2005-06-30;2005;June;Minute;Positive;0.9908113479614258;increased speculative activity in housing markets was evident in some parts of the country but robust demand for new homes owed in large part to the ongoing economic expansion and low longterm interest rates
2005-06-30;2005;June;Minute;Positive;0.9901276230812073;although the recent surge in energy prices was anticipated to impose some drag for a time consumption spending was expected to grow about in line with income going forward in an environment of further gradual improvements in labor markets

2005-06-30;2005;June;Minute;Neutral;0.989969789981842;to the extent that an asset price movement threatened the achievement of those objectives it would of course be taken into consideration in setting policy
