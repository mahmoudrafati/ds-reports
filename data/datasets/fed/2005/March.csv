2005-03-22;2005;March;Minute;Negative;0.8992272019386292;moreover the recent rebound in spot crude oil prices and especially the substantial advance in prices of crude oil futures contracts for delivery well into the future suggested that a significant unwinding of higher energy costs might not be in prospect

2005-03-22;2005;March;Minute;Negative;0.604249119758606;moreover the markup of prices over costs in nonfarm businesses remained quite high and firms would likely be pressed by competition to absorb a portion of any stepup in the growth of unit labor costs at least if that acceleration were limited in extent and duration

2005-03-22;2005;March;Minute;Neutral;0.9878124594688416;in discussing the announcement to be released after the meeting members agreed that it was appropriate to acknowledge the recent evolution in the inflation situation by indicating that though longerterm inflation expectations remain well contained pressures on inflation have picked up in recent months and pricing power is more evident
2005-03-22;2005;March;Minute;Neutral;0.9912338852882385;regarding the risks to sustainable growth and price stability members discussed a proposal to make the committees assessment explicitly conditional on an assumption of appropriate monetary policy so as to underscore that maintaining balanced risks would require policy action
2005-03-22;2005;March;Minute;Positive;0.9914295077323914;household spending supported by rising disposable income and to a lesser degree by increasing wealth was projected to expand at a solid rate

2005-03-22;2005;March;Minute;Negative;0.7329947352409363;some discomfort was expressed with language that related so explicitly to the likely trajectory of future policy action
2005-03-22;2005;March;Minute;Neutral;0.8298645615577698;they also noted that the language had not precluded a notable increase in medium and longerterm interest rates over the intermeeting period as markets extended the expected gradual increase in policy rates
2005-03-22;2005;March;Minute;Neutral;0.9719629883766174;members noted however that the existing measured pace language was clearly conditional on the economy evolving in a way that promised a gradual return to high levels of resource utilization and on inflation remaining low and thus believed that the wording did not rule out either picking up the pace of firming or pausing in the process of removing policy accommodation should circumstances warrant
2005-03-22;2005;March;Minute;Negative;0.9689624309539795;some expressed the view that such language could constrain future policy inappropriately while these concerns were not new they were now felt to be more pressing as the odds that the committee might need to step up the pace of policy firming were thought to have increased
