2005-02-02;2005;February;Minute;Positive;0.9510831832885742;however several participants suggested the possibility of an upward skew to the distribution of inflation outcomes especially if there were appreciable further declines in the foreign exchange value of the dollar or in structural productivity growth already some participants were hearing anecdotal reports from firms of an increased ability to pass cost increases through to product prices perhaps because of increasing confidence in the outlook for the economic expansion
