2007-12-11;2007;December;Minute;Positive;0.6541664600372314;reflecting upward revisions to previously published data the forecast for core pce price inflation for 2007 was a bit higher than in the preceding forecast core inflation was projected to hold steady during 2008 as the indirect effects of higher energy prices on prices of core consumer goods and services were offset by the slight easing of resource pressures and the expected deceleration in the prices of nonfuel imported goods
2007-12-11;2007;December;Minute;Positive;0.7681792378425598;accordingly economic activity was expected to increase at its potential rate in 2009 the external sector was projected to continue to support domestic economic activity throughout the forecast period
2007-12-11;2007;December;Minute;Positive;0.9894275069236755;in addition compared with the previous forecast higher oil prices and lower real income were expected to weigh on the pace of real activity throughout 2008 and 2009 by 2009 however the staff projected that the drag from those factors would lessen and that an improvement in mortgage credit availability would lead to a gradual recovery in the housing market
