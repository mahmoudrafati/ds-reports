2007-05-09;2007;May;Minute;Negative;0.9764620661735535;moreover the turmoil in the subprime market evidently had not spread to the rest of the mortgage market indeed mortgage rates available to prime borrowers remained well below their levels of last summer
2007-05-09;2007;May;Minute;Negative;0.5825145244598389;that said participants also noted that sales of existing homes appeared to have held up somewhat better since the beginning of the year
2007-05-09;2007;May;Minute;Negative;0.995969295501709;in particular the demand for new homes appeared to have weakened further in recent months and the stock of unsold homes relative to sales had increased sharply
2007-05-09;2007;May;Minute;Negative;0.8497737050056458;the incoming data on new home sales and inventories suggested that the ongoing adjustment in the housing market would probably persist for longer than previously anticipated
2007-05-09;2007;May;Minute;Negative;0.9936793446540833;the pace of economic expansion had slowed in the first part of this year but the recent subpar performance probably exaggerated the weakness of underlying demand and the rate of economic growth was expected to pick up in coming quarters
2007-05-09;2007;May;Minute;Neutral;0.9890004396438599;in their discussion of the economic situation and outlook participants noted that their assessments of the mediumterm prospects for economic growth and inflation had not changed materially from the previous meeting
2007-05-09;2007;May;Minute;Negative;0.995428204536438;growth in consumer spending appeared to have slowed over the past few months
2007-05-09;2007;May;Minute;Negative;0.9566103219985962;nonetheless the staff continued to expect core inflation to edge lower over the course of the next two years
2007-05-09;2007;May;Minute;Neutral;0.8782480955123901;in response to data received over the past year the staff had marked down slightly its estimate of structural productivity growth and nudged up its estimate for the increase in labor supplyleaving its estimate of the overall growth of potential gdp broadly unchanged
2007-05-09;2007;May;Minute;Positive;0.6877602338790894;in its forecast prepared for this meeting the staff expected the pace of economic activity to pick up from weak firstquarter growth to a rate a little below that of the economys longrun potential for the remainder of this year and to increase at a pace broadly in line with potential output in 2008 the projected gradual acceleration in economic activity largely reflected the expected waning of the drag from residential investment although recent readings on sales and inventories of new homes had been interpreted by the staff as suggesting that the ongoing contraction in residential investment would continue for longer than previously expected
2007-05-09;2007;May;Minute;Positive;0.9811311960220337;m2 accelerated during march and april primarily reflecting faster growth in liquid deposits which were likely boosted in april by taxrelated flows

2007-05-09;2007;May;Minute;Negative;0.9941350817680359;in the household sector the rise in home mortgage debt likely slowed a bit further in the first quarter as homeprice appreciation appeared to have remained sluggish
2007-05-09;2007;May;Minute;Negative;0.9666115641593933;a slowing in employment could then occur in conjunction with a strengthening in productivity growth
2007-05-09;2007;May;Minute;Positive;0.981984555721283;commercial paper outstanding declined but bank lending accelerated
2007-05-09;2007;May;Minute;Neutral;0.9847860932350159;the increases in energy and other commodity prices over the intermeeting period had led the staff to revise up its forecast for headline pce inflation during the first half of the year
2007-05-09;2007;May;Minute;Negative;0.994599461555481;real spending on goods had flattened out and contacts in both the retail sector and the consumer credit sector reported a softening in the expansion of demand
2007-05-09;2007;May;Minute;Negative;0.9814742207527161;meeting participants anticipated that real gdp would advance at a pace a little below the economys trend rate of growth through the remainder of this year and then pick up to a rate broadly in line with the economys trend rate in 2008 most participants continued to expect core inflation to slow gradually although considerable uncertainty surrounded that judgment and the committees predominant concern remained the risk that inflation would fail to moderate as expected
2007-05-09;2007;May;Minute;Negative;0.9635694026947021;aside from measurement problems a possible explanation was that these differing trends largely related to the lagged adjustment of employment to the slowing pace of expansion
2007-05-09;2007;May;Minute;Neutral;0.5334786772727966;in that regard several participants observed that the recent moderation in economic growth had been concentrated in the construction sector but that measured employment in construction had not yet declined by a corresponding amount
2007-05-09;2007;May;Minute;Neutral;0.7247862219810486;in contrast to the rapid gains of recent years meeting participants expected household expenditure to grow at a more moderate pace in coming quarters
2007-05-09;2007;May;Minute;Positive;0.9884817600250244;this apparent tension could partly reflect measurement issues in particular participants noted that the morerapid gains in estimates of gross domestic income over this period might better capture the pace of activity than the modest advances in measured gdp
2007-05-09;2007;May;Minute;Positive;0.9853222370147705;participants discussed how best to reconcile the slowdown in output growth over the past year with the relatively strong performance of the labor market

2007-05-09;2007;May;Minute;Negative;0.4721069633960724;moreover inflationary pressures in a number of overseas economies appeared to have increased of late perhaps partly in response to heightened levels of capacity utilization in those countries and this development had the potential to add to the prices of us imports
2007-05-09;2007;May;Minute;Negative;0.993035078048706;participants noted that strong foreign expansion should help to underpin demand for us exports but expressed some concern that the strength of global demand could contribute to price pressures at home

2007-05-09;2007;May;Minute;Neutral;0.9546189308166504;prices of nonenergy commodities especially metals had moved up markedly since the previous meeting
2007-05-09;2007;May;Minute;Negative;0.99407958984375;however participants cautioned against drawing too much comfort from the most recent few data observations and recognized that the current sluggishness of equipment outlays could persist for longer than currently anticipated especially if financial market conditions became less supportive
2007-05-09;2007;May;Minute;Neutral;0.8857806921005249;in particular participants took note of the upturn in orders and shipments of capital goods and of more upbeat surveys of business conditions

2007-05-09;2007;May;Minute;Negative;0.994789719581604;participants remained concerned that the housing market correction could have a more pronounced impact on consumer spending than currently expected especially if house prices were to decline significantly
2007-05-09;2007;May;Minute;Positive;0.976833701133728;consumption was likely to be supported by continued advances in employment and incomes as well as gains in stock prices but the recent increases in gasoline prices probably would damp households spending power in the near term and the effect of the anticipated leveling out in homeprice appreciation on household wealth was expected to contribute to a gradual increase in the personal saving rate over the medium run
2007-05-09;2007;May;Minute;Negative;0.9844978451728821;participants were also encouraged that outside of the construction sector the correction of inventories to more comfortable levels appeared well advanced thus reducing the possibility that going forward this adjustment process could trigger shortfalls in business spending and output
