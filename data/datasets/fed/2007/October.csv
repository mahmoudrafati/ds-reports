2007-10-31;2007;October;Minute;Neutral;0.665855884552002;while the committee saw uncertainty regarding the economic outlook as still elevated it judged that after this action the upside risks to inflation roughly balanced the downside risks to growth
2007-10-31;2007;October;Minute;Negative;0.9171044826507568;meeting participants noted that capital expenditures had grown at a solid pace in recent months and that the financial turmoil generally appeared to have had a limited effect on business capital spending plans to date
2007-10-31;2007;October;Minute;Negative;0.9907153844833374;even with some further easing of monetary policy participants expected economic growth to slow over the next few quarters reflecting continued sharp declines in the housing sector and tighter lending standards and terms across a broad range of credit products
2007-10-31;2007;October;Minute;Negative;0.9946374297142029;conditions in financial markets had improved since the september fomc meeting but functioning in a number of markets remained strained
2007-10-31;2007;October;Minute;Positive;0.6144149899482727;in their discussion of the economic outlook and situation and in the projections that they had submitted for this meeting participants noted that economic activity had expanded at a somewhat faster pace in the third quarter than previously anticipated and that there was scant evidence of negative spillovers from the ongoing housing correction to other sectors of the economy
2007-10-31;2007;October;Minute;Neutral;0.986396074295044;in conjunction with the fomc meeting in october all meeting participants federal reserve board members and reserve bank presidents provided annual projections for economic growth unemployment and inflation for the period 2007 through 2010 the projections are described in the summary of economic projections which is attached as an addendum to these minutes
2007-10-31;2007;October;Minute;Neutral;0.9418153166770935;the staff interpreted this information as suggesting some upward revision to its estimate of output growth in the third quarter a small downward revision to its forecast of growth in the current quarter and no significant change to its forecast for coming quarters
2007-10-31;2007;October;Minute;Positive;0.989403247833252;the advance data on the national income and product accounts for the third quarter which were released on the morning of the second day of the fomc meeting indicated a stronger increase in real gdp than the staff had forecast mostly because inventory investment was estimated to be higher than projected by the staff
2007-10-31;2007;October;Minute;Negative;0.872573733329773;the forecast for headline inflation was in the same range as that for core inflation in 2008 and 2009 reflecting expectations that energy prices would level off and then turn down and that increases in food prices would slow to a pace more in line with core inflation
2007-10-31;2007;October;Minute;Positive;0.8796307444572449;the staffs forecast for core pce inflation was little changed from that presented at the september meeting because favorable incoming figures on core pce inflation were offset by expectations for some limited feedthrough into retail prices of recent increases in energy prices and for slightly less easing in resource utilization
2007-10-31;2007;October;Minute;Negative;0.9886647462844849;on balance real gdp growth for 2008 was projected to slow to a pace a bit below that of its potential and unemployment was expected to creep up slightly
2007-10-31;2007;October;Minute;Negative;0.9946510195732117;the slowing of growth was likely to produce a modest increase in the unemployment rate from its recent levels leading to the emergence of a little slack in labor markets
2007-10-31;2007;October;Minute;Negative;0.9922296404838562;in addition the staff continued to expect the stress in credit markets and the appreciably higher oil prices indicated by futures markets to restrain spending by businesses and consumers although the lower foreign exchange value of the dollar suggested some boost to net exports
2007-10-31;2007;October;Minute;Negative;0.9845306873321533;nonetheless the staff expected real gdp growth to be considerably slower in the fourth quarter reflecting steepening declines in residential construction reductions in the pace of motor vehicle production and a smaller contribution from net exports
2007-10-31;2007;October;Minute;Positive;0.9907481074333191;in the forecast prepared for this meeting which was formulated prior to the release of the advance estimates of the thirdquarter national income and product accounts the staff revised up its estimate of aggregate economic activity in the third quarter from its forecast presented at the september meeting in light of available indicators that suggested that consumer spending business investment and exports were stronger than previously expected
2007-10-31;2007;October;Minute;Positive;0.9880118370056152;inflows to retail money market funds and small time deposits were especially strong in september and october small time deposits were apparently boosted by the attractive rates that banks were offering in order to help fund their expanding loan portfolios
2007-10-31;2007;October;Minute;Positive;0.9156847596168518;m2 increased significantly more slowly in september and october than the rapid pace observed in august when the financial market turmoil apparently drove investors to the safety of m2 assets
2007-10-31;2007;October;Minute;Negative;0.9914811849594116;household mortgage borrowing was estimated to have decelerated again in the third quarter
2007-10-31;2007;October;Minute;Neutral;0.8808698058128357;the expansion of business loans was apparently due in part to financings for leveraged buyouts that underwriters could not syndicate to institutional investors
2007-10-31;2007;October;Minute;Positive;0.9922062754631042;despite evidence that bank lending standards and terms had tightened over the previous three months business debt was still rising strongly reflecting a continued surge in commercial and industrial ci lending by banks and robust issuance of investmentgrade bonds
2007-10-31;2007;October;Minute;Negative;0.9951663017272949;nevertheless business sentiment appeared to have eroded somewhat amid heightened economic and financial uncertainty potentially restraining investment outlays in some industries
2007-10-31;2007;October;Minute;Neutral;0.49296924471855164;debt of the domestic nonfinancial sectors was estimated to have expanded slightly more quickly in the third quarter than in the previous quarter
2007-10-31;2007;October;Minute;Negative;0.9942398071289062;looking forward the staff expected residential investment to remain weak in 2008 with modest declines in house prices
2007-10-31;2007;October;Minute;Positive;0.7224226593971252;looking further ahead participants noted that economic growth should increase gradually to around its trend rate by 2009 as weakness in the housing sector abated and stresses in financial markets subsided
2007-10-31;2007;October;Minute;Positive;0.6213355660438538;for 2009 the forecast called for real output growth to step up to a pace slightly above potential as the drags on economic activity exerted by the contraction in residential investment and financial strains were expected to abate
2007-10-31;2007;October;Minute;Negative;0.9925271272659302;with aggregate demand showing somewhat greater than expected strength in the third quarter and little evidence of significant spillovers from the housing sector to other components of spending participants viewed the downside risks to growth as somewhat smaller than at the time of the september meeting but those risks were still seen as significant
2007-10-31;2007;October;Minute;Positive;0.9929066896438599;all told however participants envisioned that the most likely scenario was for consumer spending to continue to advance at a moderate rate in coming quarters supported by the generally strong labor market and further gains in real personal income
2007-10-31;2007;October;Minute;Negative;0.9945576190948486;participants expressed a concern that largerthanexpected declines in house prices could further sap consumer confidence as well as net worth causing a pullback in consumer spending
2007-10-31;2007;October;Minute;Negative;0.9946987628936768;moreover anecdotal reports by business contacts suggested a softening in retail sales in some regions of the country
2007-10-31;2007;October;Minute;Negative;0.993526816368103;nevertheless a number of participants cited notable declines in survey measures of consumer confidence since the onset of financial turbulence in midsummer along with sharply higher oil prices declines in house prices and tighter underwriting standards for home equity loans and some types of consumer loans as factors likely to restrain consumer spending going forward
2007-10-31;2007;October;Minute;Negative;0.9217581748962402;participants generally agreed that the available data suggested that consumer spending had been well maintained over the past several months and that spillovers from the strains in the housing market had apparently been quite limited to date
2007-10-31;2007;October;Minute;Negative;0.9916540384292603;some participants also pointed to downside risks to the housing market stemming from the large volume of substantial upward interestrate resets that were likely on subprime mortgages in coming quarters which could lead to a faster pace of foreclosures in the near term thereby intensifying the downward pressure on house prices
2007-10-31;2007;October;Minute;Negative;0.9930521249771118;nonetheless the potential for significant further weakening in housing activity and home prices represented a downside risk to the economic outlook
2007-10-31;2007;October;Minute;Negative;0.9919666051864624;in their discussion of individual sectors of the economy participants noted that the recent declines in housing activitywhile substantialhad largely been anticipated
2007-10-31;2007;October;Minute;Negative;0.9946164488792419;participants were also concerned about a potential scenario in which unexpected economic weakness could cause a further tightening of credit conditions that could in turn reinforce weakness in aggregate demand
2007-10-31;2007;October;Minute;Negative;0.9925520420074463;participants generally viewed financial markets as still fragile and were concerned that an adverse shocksuch as a sharp deterioration in credit quality or disclosure of unusually large and unanticipated lossescould further dent investor confidence and significantly increase the downside risks to the economy
2007-10-31;2007;October;Minute;Negative;0.9929065704345703;most participants pointed to the deterioration in nonprime mortgage markets as well as higher interest rates and tighter credit standards for prime nonconforming mortgages as factors that had exacerbated the deterioration in housing markets and they noted that these developments could further limit the availability of mortgage credit and depress the demand for housing
2007-10-31;2007;October;Minute;Negative;0.9873892068862915;indeed several participants noted some relapse in financial conditions late in the intermeeting period
2007-10-31;2007;October;Minute;Negative;0.9901487827301025;meeting participants also mentioned that while financial market conditions had improved the functioning of some markets remained somewhat impaired
2007-10-31;2007;October;Minute;Negative;0.99408358335495;markets for nonconforming mortgages by contrast remained disrupted
2007-10-31;2007;October;Minute;Positive;0.9910925030708313;conditions in corporate credit markets also had improved in recent weeks and most businesses were apparently having little difficulty raising external funds as evidenced by strong issuance of investmentgrade corporate bonds a pickup in speculativegrade issuance and surging ci loans
2007-10-31;2007;October;Minute;Negative;0.9938825368881226;in light of some improvement in the commercial paper and leveraged loan markets over the intermeeting period participants were somewhat less concerned that banks would not have sufficient balancesheet capacity to absorb large volumes of assets
2007-10-31;2007;October;Minute;Negative;0.9957011342048645;financial market functioning was judged to have improved somewhat since the previous fomc meeting but the situation in a number of markets remained strained and credit market conditions were thought likely to weigh on economic growth over coming quarters
2007-10-31;2007;October;Minute;Negative;0.9939960241317749;moreover unusual pressures in funding markets persisted
2007-10-31;2007;October;Minute;Positive;0.8623879551887512;nonetheless some upside risks to inflation remained reflecting in part the potential feedthrough to inflation expectations of increases in energy and import prices
2007-10-31;2007;October;Minute;Positive;0.9878227114677429;participants generally expected that inflation would edge down over the next few years a projection consistent with the recent string of encouraging releases on core consumer prices futures prices pointing to a flattening of energy costs and the anticipated easing of pressures on resources
