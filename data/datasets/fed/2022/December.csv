2022-12-14;2022;December;Minute;Neutral;0.9898629188537598;with inflation staying persistently above the committees 2 percent goal and the labor market remaining very tight all participants had raised their assessment of the appropriate path of the federal funds rate relative to their assessment at the time of the september meeting

2022-12-14;2022;December;Minute;Negative;0.7506943345069885;however a couple of them also noted that the current inversion of the yield curve could reflect in part that investors expect the nominal policy rate to decline because of a fall in inflation over time
