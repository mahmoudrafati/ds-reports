2008-06-25;2008;June;Minute;Positive;0.9764372110366821;the further large increase in energy prices also prompted an upward revision of the forecast of headline pce inflation in the second half of 2008 and headline inflation was expected to exceed core inflation by a considerable margin this year
2008-06-25;2008;June;Minute;Neutral;0.8954618573188782;but some of the recent improvement was seen as reflecting transitory factors and the forecast of core inflation for the second half of this year and next year was marked up to incorporate the likely passthrough of the recent jumps in the prices of energy and other commodities and the reversal of these transitory factors
