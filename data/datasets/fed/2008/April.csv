2008-04-30;2008;April;Minute;Neutral;0.9624217748641968;nonetheless most members agreed that a further modest easing in the stance of policy was appropriate to balance better the risks to achieving the committees dual objectives of maximum employment and price stability over the medium run
2008-04-30;2008;April;Minute;Negative;0.9922536015510559;moreover although downside risks to growth remained members were also concerned about the upside risks to the inflation outlook given the continued increases in oil and commodity prices and the fact that some indicators suggested that inflation expectations had risen in recent months
2008-04-30;2008;April;Minute;Positive;0.9883636236190796;the substantial easing of monetary policy since last september the ongoing steps taken by the federal reserve to provide liquidity and support market functioning and the imminent fiscal stimulus would help to support economic activity
2008-04-30;2008;April;Minute;Neutral;0.9773687124252319;however most members viewed the decision to reduce interest rates at this meeting as a close call
2008-04-30;2008;April;Minute;Positive;0.8336557745933533;a reduction in interest rates would help to mitigate those risks
2008-04-30;2008;April;Minute;Negative;0.9939826130867004;moreover although the likelihood that economic activity would be severely disrupted by a sharp deterioration in financial markets had apparently receded most members thought that the risks to economic growth were still skewed to the downside
2008-04-30;2008;April;Minute;Positive;0.9733480215072632;an additional easing in policy would help to foster moderate growth over time without impeding a moderation in inflation
2008-04-30;2008;April;Minute;Negative;0.9948717355728149;in that regard several members noted that it was unlikely to be appropriate to ease policy in response to information suggesting that the economy was slowing further or even contracting slightly in the near term unless economic and financial developments indicated a significant weakening of the economic outlook
2008-04-30;2008;April;Minute;Negative;0.9952378273010254;although prospects for economic activity had not deteriorated significantly since the march meeting the outlook for growth and employment remained weak and slack in resource utilization was likely to increase
2008-04-30;2008;April;Minute;Positive;0.9681821465492249;this view suggested that the stimulus from past monetary policy easing would be felt mainly as conditions in financial markets improved
2008-04-30;2008;April;Minute;Negative;0.9922653436660767;several participants expressed the view that the easing in monetary policy since last fall had not as yet led to a loosening in overall financial conditions but rather had prevented financial conditions from tightening as much as they otherwise would have in response to escalating strains in financial markets
2008-04-30;2008;April;Minute;Negative;0.8387395143508911;however other participants observed that the pronounced strains in banking and financial markets imparted much greater uncertainty to such assessments and meant that measures of the stance of policy based on the real federal funds rate were not likely to provide a reliable guide in the current environment
2008-04-30;2008;April;Minute;Neutral;0.5030565857887268;even taking account of current financial headwinds such a low rate could suggest that policy was reasonably accommodative

2008-04-30;2008;April;Minute;Neutral;0.8039121031761169;however participants emphasized that appropriate monetary policy combined with effective communication of the committees commitment to price stability would mitigate this risk
2008-04-30;2008;April;Minute;Negative;0.920205295085907;the possibility that inflation expectations could increase was viewed as a key upside risk to the inflation outlook
2008-04-30;2008;April;Minute;Negative;0.9950833320617676;a number of participants voiced concern that longterm inflation expectations could drift upwards if headline inflation remained elevated for a protracted period or if the recent substantial policy easing was misinterpreted by the public as suggesting that committee members had a greater tolerance for inflation than previously thought
2008-04-30;2008;April;Minute;Neutral;0.9493052363395691;on balance participants expected the recent increases in oil and food prices to continue to boost overall consumer price inflation in the near term thereafter total inflation was projected to moderate with all participants expecting total pce inflation of between 112 percent and 2 percent by 2010 participants stressed that the expected moderation in inflation was dependent on the continued stability of inflation expectations
2008-04-30;2008;April;Minute;Neutral;0.8459436893463135;however several participants were of the view that wage inflation tended to lag increases in prices and so may not provide a useful guide to emerging price pressures
2008-04-30;2008;April;Minute;Negative;0.994782030582428;available data and anecdotal reports indicated that gains in labor compensation remained moderate and some participants suggested that wage growth was unlikely to pick up sharply in coming quarters if as anticipated labor markets remained relatively soft
