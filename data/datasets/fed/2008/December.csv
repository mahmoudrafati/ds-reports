2008-12-16;2008;December;Minute;Positive;0.9852637052536011;the added clarity in that regard might help forestall the development of expectations that inflation would decline below desired levels and hence keep real interest rates low and support aggregate demand
2008-12-16;2008;December;Minute;Neutral;0.9944576025009155;another possible form of communication that participants discussed was a more explicit indication of their views on what longerrun rate of inflation would best promote their goals of maximum employment and price stability
2008-12-16;2008;December;Minute;Neutral;0.9872661828994751;in particular participants judged that communicating the committees expectation that shortterm interest rates were likely to stay exceptionally low for some time could be useful because it could lead to pricing of longerterm interest rates consistent with the path of monetary policy that policymakers saw as most likely
