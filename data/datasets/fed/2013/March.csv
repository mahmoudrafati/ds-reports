2013-03-20;2013;March;Minute;Neutral;0.471979022026062;in particular participants pointed to possible risks to the stability of the financial system the functioning of particular financial markets the smooth withdrawal of monetary accommodation when it eventually becomes appropriate and the federal reserves net income
2013-03-20;2013;March;Minute;Negative;0.9812894463539124;inference about the labor force participation rate was complicated by its longrun downward trend
2013-03-20;2013;March;Minute;Negative;0.9892780780792236;asset purchases were seen by some as having a potential to contribute to imbalances in financial markets and asset prices which could undermine financial stability over time
2013-03-20;2013;March;Minute;Negative;0.9780666828155518;committee policy action committee members saw the information received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that moderate economic growth had resumed following a pause late last year
2013-03-20;2013;March;Minute;Neutral;0.9802652597427368;their views on the practical importance of these risks varied as did their prescriptions for mitigating them
2013-03-20;2013;March;Minute;Neutral;0.9904695153236389;a number of participants suggested that the committee could change the mix of its policy tools if necessary to increase or maintain overall accommodation including potentially adjusting its forward guidance or its balance sheet policies
2013-03-20;2013;March;Minute;Neutral;0.9824594259262085;a couple of these participants noted that if progress toward the committees economic goals were not maintained the pace of purchases might appropriately be increased
2013-03-20;2013;March;Minute;Neutral;0.9855749607086182;a range of views was expressed regarding the economic and labor market conditions that would call for an adjustment in the pace of purchases
2013-03-20;2013;March;Minute;Positive;0.9102631211280823;many participants including some of those who were focused on the increasing risks expressed the view that continued solid improvement in the outlook for the labor market could prompt the committee to slow the pace of purchases beginning at some point over the next several meetings while a few participants suggested that economic conditions would likely justify continuing the program at its current pace at least until late in the year
2013-03-20;2013;March;Minute;Negative;0.8561913371086121;a few others saw the risks as increasing fairly quickly with the size of the federal reserves balance sheet and judged that the pace of purchases would likely need to be reduced before long
2013-03-20;2013;March;Minute;Neutral;0.9767753481864929;a few participants noted that they already viewed the costs as likely outweighing the benefits and so would like to bring the program to a close relatively soon
2013-03-20;2013;March;Minute;Neutral;0.9899153709411621;in light of their discussion of the benefits and costs of asset purchases participants discussed their views on the appropriate course for the current asset purchase program
2013-03-20;2013;March;Minute;Neutral;0.9354235529899597;a few participants noted that curtailing the purchase program was the most direct way to mitigate the costs and risks
2013-03-20;2013;March;Minute;Negative;0.9573416113853455;overall most meeting participants thought the risks and costs of additional asset purchases remained manageable but also that continued close attention to these issues was warranted
2013-03-20;2013;March;Minute;Neutral;0.9704911112785339;such a decision was also seen by some as a potential source of additional nearterm policy accommodation
2013-03-20;2013;March;Minute;Positive;0.6249035596847534;a decision not to sell mbs or to sell mbs only very slowly would also mitigate some of the financial stability risks that could be associated with such sales as well as damp the decline in remittances to the treasury at that time
2013-03-20;2013;March;Minute;Neutral;0.9713501334190369;in this regard several participants noted that a decision by the committee to hold its mbs to maturity instead of selling them would essentially eliminate this risk
2013-03-20;2013;March;Minute;Positive;0.9881798028945923;many participants emphasized that any decision to reduce the pace of purchases should reflect both an improvement in their overall outlook for labor market conditions as implied by a wide range of available indicators and their confidence in the sustainability of that improvement
2013-03-20;2013;March;Minute;Negative;0.9910895824432373;another exitrelated concern was a possible adverse effect on market functioning from mbs sales during the normalization of the federal reserves balance sheet
2013-03-20;2013;March;Minute;Negative;0.9934095144271851;although the committees asset purchases have had little apparent effect on securities market functioning to date some participants felt that future asset sales could prove more challenging
2013-03-20;2013;March;Minute;Negative;0.9710773229598999;moreover to the extent that asset purchases push down longerterm interest rates they potentially expose financial markets to a rapid rise in those rates in the future which could impose significant losses on some investors and intermediaries
2013-03-20;2013;March;Minute;Negative;0.5025634169578552;it was also noted that the accommodative stance of policy could be supporting financial stability by returning the economy to a stable footing sooner than would otherwise be the case and perhaps by allowing borrowers to secure longerterm financing and thereby reduce funding risks by contrast curtailing asset purchases could slow the recovery and so extend the period of very low interest rates
2013-03-20;2013;March;Minute;Negative;0.9007349014282227;one consequence of asset purchases has been the increase in the federal reserves net income and its remittances to the treasury but those values were projected to decline perhaps even to zero for a time as the committee eventually withdraws policy accommodation
2013-03-20;2013;March;Minute;Negative;0.9930069446563721;some participants were concerned that a substantial decline in remittances might lead to an adverse public reaction or potentially undermine federal reserve credibility or effectiveness
2013-03-20;2013;March;Minute;Negative;0.9934167861938477;nevertheless a number of participants remained concerned about the potential for financial stability risks to build
2013-03-20;2013;March;Minute;Positive;0.6129501461982727;several participants suggested that enhanced supervision could serve to limit at least to some extent the increased risktaking associated with a lengthy period of low longterm interest rates and that effective policy communication or balance sheet management by the committee could reduce the probability of excessively rapid increases in longerterm rates
2013-03-20;2013;March;Minute;Neutral;0.9581193327903748;several participants stated that such risks should not inhibit the committee from pursuing its mandated objectives for inflation and employment
2013-03-20;2013;March;Minute;Positive;0.8691834211349487;in any case it was indicated that the fiscal benefits of a stronger economy would be much greater than any shortterm fluctuations in remittances and moreover a couple of participants noted that cumulative remittances to the treasury would likely be higher than would have been the case without any asset purchases
2013-03-20;2013;March;Minute;Negative;0.990297257900238;some participants also were concerned that additional asset purchases could complicate the eventual firming of policyfor example by impairing the committees control over the federal funds rate
2013-03-20;2013;March;Minute;Negative;0.9620680212974548;a few participants raised the possibility of an undesirable rise in inflation
2013-03-20;2013;March;Minute;Neutral;0.9348175525665283;the possibility of such outcomes was seen as necessitating clear communications about the outlook for federal reserve net income
2013-03-20;2013;March;Minute;Positive;0.9735044240951538;however others expressed confidence in the committees exit tools and its resolve to keep inflation near its longerrun goal
