2013-09-18;2013;September;Minute;Negative;0.9671480655670166;one participant suggested that postponing the reduction in the pace of asset purchases would also allow time for the committee to further discuss and to implement a clarification or strengthening of its forward guidance for the federal funds rate which could temper the risk that a future downward adjustment in asset purchases would cause an undesirable tightening of financial conditions

2013-09-18;2013;September;Minute;Negative;0.9949559569358826;moreover maintaining the pace of purchases could be perceived as a sign that the fomc had turned more pessimistic about the economic outlook
