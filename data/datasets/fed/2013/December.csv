2013-12-18;2013;December;Minute;Neutral;0.9936867356300354;when the committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longerrun goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent
2013-12-18;2013;December;Minute;Neutral;0.9656956791877747;in their discussion of monetary policy in the period ahead most members agreed that the cumulative improvement in labor market conditions and the likelihood that the improvement would be sustained indicated that the committee could appropriately begin to slow the pace of its asset purchases at this meeting

2013-12-18;2013;December;Minute;Neutral;0.5513048768043518;these indicators generally suggested that such risks were moderate in part because of the reduction in leverage and maturity transformation that has occurred in the financial sector since the onset of the financial crisis

2013-12-18;2013;December;Minute;Neutral;0.9719122648239136;these factors apparently led market participants to raise the odds they assigned to a reduction in the pace of asset purchases at the december meeting and to leave roughly unchanged their expectations for the timing of the first increase in the target federal funds rate

2013-12-18;2013;December;Minute;Neutral;0.9106066823005676;some participants suggested that inflation while low was unlikely to slow further pointing to core trimmed mean or stickyprice inflation measures as indicative of fairly steady underlying price trends most measures of wage gains were also steady
2013-12-18;2013;December;Minute;Negative;0.9431641697883606;several participants suggested that some of the factors that had held down inflation recently such as the slowing in price increases for medical care and banking services were likely to prove transitory

2013-12-18;2013;December;Minute;Negative;0.9935021996498108;a few participants noted the risk that the persistent weakness in labor force participation and low rates of productivity growth might indicate lasting structural economic damage from the financial crisis and ensuing recession
2013-12-18;2013;December;Minute;Negative;0.9843642115592957;however several others continued to see important elements of cyclical weakness in the low labor force participation rate and cited other indicators of considerable slack in the labor market including the stillhigh levels of longduration unemployment and of workers employed part time for economic reasons and the stilldepressed ratio of employment to population for workers ages 25 to 54 in addition although a couple of participants had heard reports of labor shortages particularly for workers with specialized skills most measures of wages had not accelerated
2013-12-18;2013;December;Minute;Negative;0.9940707087516785;some participants cited research that found that demographic and other structural factors particularly rising retirements by older workers accounted for much of the recent decline in participation

2013-12-18;2013;December;Minute;Positive;0.9905158281326294;committee participants generally viewed the increases in nonfarm payroll employment of more than 200000 per month in october and november and the decline in the unemployment rate to 7 percent as encouraging signs of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions
2013-12-18;2013;December;Minute;Positive;0.9888594150543213;despite the recent softening participants discussed a number of factors that should support a continued recovery in housing going forward
2013-12-18;2013;December;Minute;Positive;0.9866347312927246;however members also weighed a number of considerations regarding such an action including their degree of confidence in prospects for sustained abovepotential economic growth continued improvement in labor market conditions and a return of inflation to its mandateconsistent level over time
2013-12-18;2013;December;Minute;Positive;0.9902461767196655;these included expectations that mortgage interest rates would remain relatively favorable that rising home values would boost household wealth and further reduce the number of borrowers with underwater mortgages that consumer incomes and confidence would continue to rise as employment expanded and that a pickup in household formation would support the demand for housing

2013-12-18;2013;December;Minute;Negative;0.9916957020759583;however participants generally judged that the extent of the restraint may have begun to diminish as the effects of the payroll tax increases earlier in the year seem to have waned and the drag on real activity from restrictive fiscal policies was expected to decline further going forward

2013-12-18;2013;December;Minute;Negative;0.9857062101364136;several cited other indicators of progress in the labor market such as the decline in new claims for unemployment insurance the uptrend in quits or the rise in the number of small businesses reporting job openings that were hard to fill
2013-12-18;2013;December;Minute;Neutral;0.9929337501525879;another suggested that the importance of financial stability considerations in the committees deliberations would likely increase over time as progress is made toward the committees objectives and that such considerations should be incorporated into forward guidance for the federal funds rate and asset purchases

2013-12-18;2013;December;Minute;Neutral;0.9934374690055847;in the view of the few participants who advocated such a change a lower threshold would be a clear signal of the committees intentions and was an appropriate adjustment in light of recent labor market and inflation trends
2013-12-18;2013;December;Minute;Negative;0.9906297326087952;in contrast a few others expressed concern that any change in the threshold might be confusing and could undermine the credibility of the committees forward guidance
2013-12-18;2013;December;Minute;Neutral;0.9891955852508545;most were inclined to retain the current thresholds for the unemployment and inflation rates and to instead provide qualitative guidance regarding the committees likely behavior after a threshold was crossed

2013-12-18;2013;December;Minute;Neutral;0.9777610301971436;against this backdrop most participants saw a reduction in the pace of purchases as appropriate at this meeting and consistent with the committees previous policy communications
2013-12-18;2013;December;Minute;Neutral;0.9616185426712036;in their discussion of the appropriate path for monetary policy participants considered whether the cumulative improvement in labor market conditions since the asset purchase program began in september 2012 and the associated improvement in the outlook for the labor market warranted a reduction in the pace of asset purchases
2013-12-18;2013;December;Minute;Negative;0.991845428943634;however several participants stressed that the unemployment rate remained elevated that a range of other indicators had shown less progress toward levels consistent with a full recovery in the labor market and that the projected pickup in economic growth was not assured

2013-12-18;2013;December;Minute;Negative;0.9083701968193054;for some the considerable slack remaining in the labor market and shortfall of inflation from the committees longerrun objective warranted continuing asset purchases at the current pace for a time in order to wait for additional information confirming sustained progress toward the committees objectives or to promote faster progress toward those objectives

2013-12-18;2013;December;Minute;Neutral;0.9721773266792297;among those inclined to begin to reduce the pace of asset purchases at this meeting many favored a modest initial reduction accompanied by guidance indicating that decisions regarding future reductions would depend on economic and financial developments as well as the efficacy and costs of purchases
2013-12-18;2013;December;Minute;Neutral;0.7419885993003845;some other participants preferred a larger reduction in purchases at this meeting and future reductions that would bring the program to a close relatively quickly
2013-12-18;2013;December;Minute;Negative;0.9420458078384399;a few proposed that the committee lay out either at this meeting or subsequently a more deterministic path for winding down the program or that it announce a fixed amount of additional purchases and an expected completion date thereby reducing uncertainty about the trajectory of the purchase program
2013-12-18;2013;December;Minute;Neutral;0.9846084713935852;participants also considered the potential for clarifying or strengthening the committees forward guidance for the federal funds rate
