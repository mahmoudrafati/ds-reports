2013-10-16;2013;October;Minute;Negative;0.8404570817947388;members also discussed whether to add to the forward guidance in the policy statement an indication that the headwinds restraining the economic recovery were likely to abate only gradually with the federal funds rate target anticipated to remain below its longerrun normal value for a considerable time
2013-10-16;2013;October;Minute;Neutral;0.9936508536338806;members noted the improvement in financial conditions since the time of the september meeting and agreed that it was appropriate to drop the reference which was included in the september statement to the tightening of financial conditions seen over the summer
2013-10-16;2013;October;Minute;Neutral;0.6207094788551331;in addition to updating its description of the state of the economy the committee considered whether to note that the effects of the temporary government shutdown had made economic conditions more difficult to assess but judged that this might overemphasize the role of the shutdown in the committees policy deliberations
2013-10-16;2013;October;Minute;Neutral;0.9920802712440491;members also discussed the wording of the policy statement to be issued following the meeting

2013-10-16;2013;October;Minute;Negative;0.9812977313995361;by contrast participants expressed a range of concerns about using open market operations aimed at affecting the expected path of shortterm interest rates such as a standing purchase facility for shorterterm treasury securities or the provision of term funding through repurchase agreements
2013-10-16;2013;October;Minute;Positive;0.8274613618850708;a couple of participants observed that the decision at the september fomc meeting might have strengthened the credibility of monetary policy as suggested by the downward shift in the expected path of shortterm interest rates that had brought the path more closely into alignment with the committees forward guidance
2013-10-16;2013;October;Minute;Neutral;0.9924869537353516;one possible explanation for this view was an inference on the part of investors that a change in asset purchases reflected a change in the committees outlook for the economy which would be associated with adjustments in both the purchase program and the expected path of policy rates another was a perspective that a change in asset purchases would be read as providing information about the willingness of the committee to pursue its economic objectives with both tools
2013-10-16;2013;October;Minute;Neutral;0.9865756630897522;in this context participants discussed the financial market response to the committees decisions at its june and september meetings and more generally the complexities associated with communications about the committees current policy tools

2013-10-16;2013;October;Minute;Negative;0.9948157668113708;one participant stated that the extended period of nearzero interest rates continued to create challenges for the banking industry as net interest margins remained under pressure
2013-10-16;2013;October;Minute;Negative;0.9951583743095398;a few participants expressed concerns about the eventual economic impact of the change in financial conditions since the spring in particular increases in mortgage rates and home prices had reduced the affordability of housing and the higher rates were at least partly responsible for some slowing in that sector
2013-10-16;2013;October;Minute;Positive;0.9731999635696411;nevertheless term premiums appeared to only partially retrace their rise of earlier in the year and longerterm interest rates remained well above their levels in the spring
2013-10-16;2013;October;Minute;Negative;0.5566139221191406;it was noted that interest rate volatility was substantially lower than at the time of the september meeting and a couple of participants pointed to signs suggesting that reachingforyield behavior might be increasing again

2013-10-16;2013;October;Minute;Neutral;0.9749369621276855;available information suggested that inflation remained subdued and below the committees longerrun objective of 2 percent
2013-10-16;2013;October;Minute;Negative;0.9921114444732666;furthermore a secular decline in labor market dynamism or turnover might have contributed to a reduction in the size of normal monthly payroll gains
2013-10-16;2013;October;Minute;Negative;0.7394532561302185;for instance if the decline in labor force participation reflected decisions to retire it was unlikely to be reversed because retirees were unlikely to return to the labor force
2013-10-16;2013;October;Minute;Neutral;0.9777200222015381;however a few participants offered reasons why recent readings on the unemployment rate might provide an accurate assessment on balance of the extent of improvement in the labor market
2013-10-16;2013;October;Minute;Negative;0.9917604923248291;the drop in the unemployment rate over the past year while welcome and significant could overstate the degree of improvement in labor market conditions in part because of the decline in the labor force participation rate
2013-10-16;2013;October;Minute;Negative;0.9444237947463989;the limited pace of gains in wages and payrolls as well as the number of employees working part time for economic reasons were mentioned as evidence of substantial remaining slack in the labor market
2013-10-16;2013;October;Minute;Positive;0.9861546158790588;although a number of participants indicated that the september employment report was somewhat disappointing they judged that the labor market continued to improve albeit slowly
2013-10-16;2013;October;Minute;Negative;0.9944642186164856;nonetheless it was noted that the stance of fiscal policy was likely to remain one of the most important headwinds restraining growth over the medium term
2013-10-16;2013;October;Minute;Negative;0.9868369102478027;more broadly fiscal policy which has been exerting significant restraint on economic growth was expected to become somewhat less restrictive over the forecast period
2013-10-16;2013;October;Minute;Neutral;0.7879189252853394;among the concerns voiced was that such operations would inhibit price discovery and remove valuable sources of market information in addition such operations might be difficult to explain to the public complicate the committees communications and appear inconsistent with the economic thresholds for the federal funds rate
2013-10-16;2013;October;Minute;Negative;0.9930763244628906;participants generally saw the direct economic effects of the partial shutdown of the federal government as temporary and limited but a number of them expressed concern about the possible economic effects of repeated fiscal impasses on business and consumer confidence
2013-10-16;2013;October;Minute;Positive;0.5184651017189026;finally revised data showed that the historical relationship between real gdp growth and changes in the unemployment rate had remained broadly in place in recent years suggesting that the unemployment rate continued to provide a reasonably accurate signal about the strength of the labor market and the degree of slack in the economy
2013-10-16;2013;October;Minute;Neutral;0.9877346158027649;with regard to the asset purchase program one suggestion was to repeat a set of principles in public communications for example participants could emphasize that the program was data dependent that any reduction in the pace of purchases would depend on both the cumulative progress in labor markets since the start of the program as well as the outlook for future gains and that a continuing assessment of the efficacy and costs of asset purchases might lead the committee to decide at some point to change the mix of its policy tools while maintaining a high degree of accommodation
2013-10-16;2013;October;Minute;Neutral;0.9866688251495361;financial quotes suggested that markets moved out the date at which they expected to see the committee first increase the federal funds rate target
2013-10-16;2013;October;Minute;Neutral;0.9349914789199829;participants also weighed the merits of stating that even after the unemployment rate dropped below 612 percent the target for the federal funds rate would not be raised so long as the inflation rate was projected to run below a given level
2013-10-16;2013;October;Minute;Neutral;0.9901487827301025;participants also discussed a range of possible actions that could be considered if the committee wished to signal its intention to keep shortterm rates low or reinforce the forward guidance on the federal funds rate
2013-10-16;2013;October;Minute;Neutral;0.9921453595161438;another suggestion for enhancing communications was to use the summary of economic projections to provide more information about participants views
2013-10-16;2013;October;Minute;Neutral;0.9769813418388367;these or other modifications to the forward guidance for the federal funds rate could be implemented in the future either to improve clarity or to add to policy accommodation perhaps in conjunction with a reduction in the pace of asset purchases as part of a rebalancing of the committees tools
2013-10-16;2013;October;Minute;Neutral;0.6866227984428406;other factors besides those headwinds were also mentioned as possibly providing a rationale for maintaining a low trajectory for the federal funds rate including following through on a commitment to support the economy by maintaining moreaccommodative policy for longer
2013-10-16;2013;October;Minute;Negative;0.9847173094749451;alternatively the policy statement could indicate that even after the first increase in the federal funds rate target the committee anticipated keeping the rate below its longerrun equilibrium value for some time as economic headwinds were likely to diminish only slowly
2013-10-16;2013;October;Minute;Neutral;0.9938048124313354;such guidance could indicate the range of information that the committee would consider in evaluating when it would be appropriate to raise the federal funds rate
2013-10-16;2013;October;Minute;Neutral;0.9874744415283203;several participants concluded that providing additional qualitative information on the committees intentions regarding the federal funds rate after the unemployment threshold was reached could be more helpful
2013-10-16;2013;October;Minute;Positive;0.9805437922477722;in general the benefits of adding this kind of quantitative floor for inflation were viewed as uncertain and likely to be rather modest and communicating it could present challenges but a few participants remained favorably inclined toward it
2013-10-16;2013;October;Minute;Negative;0.9941650032997131;a couple of participants favored simply reducing the 612 percent unemployment rate threshold but others noted that such a change might raise concerns about the durability of the committees commitment to the thresholds
2013-10-16;2013;October;Minute;Neutral;0.9915910959243774;as part of the planning discussion participants also examined several possibilities for clarifying or strengthening the forward guidance for the federal funds rate including by providing additional information about the likely path of the rate either after one of the economic thresholds in the current guidance was reached or after the funds rate target was eventually raised from its current exceptionally low level
2013-10-16;2013;October;Minute;Negative;0.9171850085258484;however some others indicated that they could back trimming the pace of treasury purchases more rapidly than those of mbs perhaps to signal an intention to support mortgage markets and one participant thought that trimming mbs first would reduce the potential for distortions in credit allocation
2013-10-16;2013;October;Minute;Neutral;0.9779729247093201;with regard to future reductions in asset purchases participants discussed how those might be split across asset classes
2013-10-16;2013;October;Minute;Neutral;0.9900535345077515;a number of participants believed that making roughly equal adjustments to purchases of treasury securities and mbs would be appropriate and relatively straightforward to communicate to the public
2013-10-16;2013;October;Minute;Neutral;0.9554250240325928;a calendarbased stepdown would run counter to the datadependent statecontingent nature of the current asset purchase program but it would be easier to communicate and might help the public separate the committees purchase program from its policy for the federal funds rate and the overall stance of policy
2013-10-16;2013;October;Minute;Neutral;0.9884347915649414;as an alternative some participants mentioned that it might be preferable to adopt an even simpler plan and announce a total size of remaining purchases or a timetable for winding down the program
2013-10-16;2013;October;Minute;Negative;0.7605146765708923;while some were open to considering such a rule others viewed that approach as unlikely to reliably produce appropriate policy outcomes
2013-10-16;2013;October;Minute;Neutral;0.9916753768920898;participants generally expressed reservations about the possibility of introducing a simple mechanical rule that would adjust the pace of asset purchases automatically based on a single variable such as the unemployment rate or payroll employment
2013-10-16;2013;October;Minute;Neutral;0.993259608745575;in those circumstances it might well be appropriate to offset the effects of reduced purchases by undertaking alternative actions to provide accommodation at the same time
2013-10-16;2013;October;Minute;Neutral;0.6728355288505554;nonetheless some participants noted that if the committee were going to contemplate cutting purchases in the future based on criteria other than improvement in the labor market outlook such as concerns about the efficacy or costs of further asset purchases it would need to communicate effectively about those other criteria
2013-10-16;2013;October;Minute;Positive;0.9618952870368958;a couple of participants thought it premature to focus on this latter eventuality observing that the purchase program had been effective and that more time was needed to assess the outlook for the labor market and inflation moreover international comparisons suggested that the federal reserves balance sheet retained ample capacity relative to the scale of the us economy
2013-10-16;2013;October;Minute;Neutral;0.6653316020965576;however participants also considered scenarios under which it might at some stage be appropriate to begin to wind down the program before an unambiguous further improvement in the outlook was apparent
2013-10-16;2013;October;Minute;Neutral;0.9894930124282837;they generally expected that the data would prove consistent with the committees outlook for ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and would thus warrant trimming the pace of purchases in coming months

2013-10-30;2013;October;Minute;Neutral;0.9349914789199829;participants also weighed the merits of stating that even after the unemployment rate dropped below 612 percent the target for the federal funds rate would not be raised so long as the inflation rate was projected to run below a given level
2013-10-30;2013;October;Minute;Negative;0.9941650032997131;a couple of participants favored simply reducing the 612 percent unemployment rate threshold but others noted that such a change might raise concerns about the durability of the committees commitment to the thresholds
2013-10-30;2013;October;Minute;Neutral;0.9915910959243774;as part of the planning discussion participants also examined several possibilities for clarifying or strengthening the forward guidance for the federal funds rate including by providing additional information about the likely path of the rate either after one of the economic thresholds in the current guidance was reached or after the funds rate target was eventually raised from its current exceptionally low level
2013-10-30;2013;October;Minute;Negative;0.9171850085258484;however some others indicated that they could back trimming the pace of treasury purchases more rapidly than those of mbs perhaps to signal an intention to support mortgage markets and one participant thought that trimming mbs first would reduce the potential for distortions in credit allocation
2013-10-30;2013;October;Minute;Neutral;0.9900535345077515;a number of participants believed that making roughly equal adjustments to purchases of treasury securities and mbs would be appropriate and relatively straightforward to communicate to the public
2013-10-30;2013;October;Minute;Neutral;0.9779729247093201;with regard to future reductions in asset purchases participants discussed how those might be split across asset classes
2013-10-30;2013;October;Minute;Neutral;0.9884347915649414;as an alternative some participants mentioned that it might be preferable to adopt an even simpler plan and announce a total size of remaining purchases or a timetable for winding down the program
2013-10-30;2013;October;Minute;Negative;0.7605146765708923;while some were open to considering such a rule others viewed that approach as unlikely to reliably produce appropriate policy outcomes
2013-10-30;2013;October;Minute;Neutral;0.9916753768920898;participants generally expressed reservations about the possibility of introducing a simple mechanical rule that would adjust the pace of asset purchases automatically based on a single variable such as the unemployment rate or payroll employment
2013-10-30;2013;October;Minute;Neutral;0.993259608745575;in those circumstances it might well be appropriate to offset the effects of reduced purchases by undertaking alternative actions to provide accommodation at the same time
2013-10-30;2013;October;Minute;Neutral;0.6728355288505554;nonetheless some participants noted that if the committee were going to contemplate cutting purchases in the future based on criteria other than improvement in the labor market outlook such as concerns about the efficacy or costs of further asset purchases it would need to communicate effectively about those other criteria
2013-10-30;2013;October;Minute;Neutral;0.9554250240325928;a calendarbased stepdown would run counter to the datadependent statecontingent nature of the current asset purchase program but it would be easier to communicate and might help the public separate the committees purchase program from its policy for the federal funds rate and the overall stance of policy
2013-10-30;2013;October;Minute;Positive;0.9618952870368958;a couple of participants thought it premature to focus on this latter eventuality observing that the purchase program had been effective and that more time was needed to assess the outlook for the labor market and inflation moreover international comparisons suggested that the federal reserves balance sheet retained ample capacity relative to the scale of the us economy
2013-10-30;2013;October;Minute;Neutral;0.991827130317688;a number of participants noted that recent movements in interest rates and other indicators suggested that financial markets viewed the committees toolsasset purchases and forward guidance regarding the federal funds rateas closely linked
2013-10-30;2013;October;Minute;Neutral;0.9924869537353516;one possible explanation for this view was an inference on the part of investors that a change in asset purchases reflected a change in the committees outlook for the economy which would be associated with adjustments in both the purchase program and the expected path of policy rates another was a perspective that a change in asset purchases would be read as providing information about the willingness of the committee to pursue its economic objectives with both tools
2013-10-30;2013;October;Minute;Positive;0.8274613618850708;a couple of participants observed that the decision at the september fomc meeting might have strengthened the credibility of monetary policy as suggested by the downward shift in the expected path of shortterm interest rates that had brought the path more closely into alignment with the committees forward guidance
2013-10-30;2013;October;Minute;Neutral;0.9904387593269348;participants broadly endorsed making the committees communications as simple clear and consistent as possible and discussed ways of doing so
2013-10-30;2013;October;Minute;Neutral;0.9877346158027649;with regard to the asset purchase program one suggestion was to repeat a set of principles in public communications for example participants could emphasize that the program was data dependent that any reduction in the pace of purchases would depend on both the cumulative progress in labor markets since the start of the program as well as the outlook for future gains and that a continuing assessment of the efficacy and costs of asset purchases might lead the committee to decide at some point to change the mix of its policy tools while maintaining a high degree of accommodation
2013-10-30;2013;October;Minute;Neutral;0.882091224193573;voting for this
2013-10-30;2013;October;Minute;Neutral;0.986369252204895;during this general discussion of policy strategy and tactics participants reviewed issues specific to the committees asset purchase program
2013-10-30;2013;October;Minute;Neutral;0.9894930124282837;they generally expected that the data would prove consistent with the committees outlook for ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and would thus warrant trimming the pace of purchases in coming months
2013-10-30;2013;October;Minute;Neutral;0.6653316020965576;however participants also considered scenarios under which it might at some stage be appropriate to begin to wind down the program before an unambiguous further improvement in the outlook was apparent
2013-10-30;2013;October;Minute;Neutral;0.9921453595161438;another suggestion for enhancing communications was to use the summary of economic projections to provide more information about participants views
2013-10-30;2013;October;Minute;Neutral;0.9865756630897522;in this context participants discussed the financial market response to the committees decisions at its june and september meetings and more generally the complexities associated with communications about the committees current policy tools
