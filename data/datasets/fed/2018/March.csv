2018-03-21;2018;March;Minute;Neutral;0.9892505407333374;several participants expressed the judgment that it would likely become appropriate at some point for the committee to set the federal funds rate above its longerrun normal value for a time
2018-03-21;2018;March;Minute;Negative;0.9885883331298828;participants agreed that the longerrun normal federal funds rate was likely lower than in the past in part because of secular forces that had put downward pressure on real interest rates
2018-03-21;2018;March;Minute;Positive;0.9870280027389526;a number of participants indicated that the stronger outlook for economic activity along with their increased confidence that inflation would return to 2 percent over the medium term implied that the appropriate path for the federal funds rate over the next few years would likely be slightly steeper than they had previously expected
2018-03-21;2018;March;Minute;Positive;0.8059737682342529;several participants commented that this gradual approach was most likely to be conducive to maintaining strong labor market conditions and returning inflation to 2 percent on a sustained basis without resulting in conditions that would eventually require an abrupt policy tightening

2018-03-21;2018;March;Minute;Neutral;0.8564013838768005;a couple of participants pointed to possible benefits of postponing an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate until a subsequent meeting these participants suggested that waiting for additional data to provide more evidence of a sustained return of the 12month inflation rate to 2 percent might more clearly demonstrate the data dependence of the committees decisions and its resolve to achieve the pricestability component of its dual mandate
2018-03-21;2018;March;Minute;Positive;0.9903092980384827;these participants agreed that even after such an increase in the target range the stance of monetary policy would remain accommodative supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation

2018-03-21;2018;March;Minute;Neutral;0.8874894380569458;a few participants suggested that a modest inflation overshoot might help push up longerterm inflation expectations and anchor them at a level consistent with the committees 2 percent inflation objective
2018-03-21;2018;March;Minute;Positive;0.9908932447433472;most participants commented that the stronger economic outlook and the somewhat higher inflation readings in recent months had increased the likelihood of progress toward the committees 2 percent inflation objective
2018-03-21;2018;March;Minute;Neutral;0.97703617811203;this expectation partly reflected the arithmetic effect of the soft readings on inflation in early 2017 dropping out of the calculation it was noted that the increase in the inflation rate arising from this source was widely expected and by itself would not justify a change in the projected path for the federal funds rate

2018-03-21;2018;March;Minute;Negative;0.993802547454834;a few participants argued that either an absence of pricing power among at least some firmsperhaps stemming from globalization and technological innovations including ones that facilitate price comparisonsor the ability of firms to find ways to cut costs of production has been damping inflationary pressures
2018-03-21;2018;March;Minute;Neutral;0.8710799813270569;in their discussion of developments in financial markets some participants observed that financial conditions remained accommodative despite the rise in market volatility and repricing of assets that had occurred in february
