2020-01-29;2020;January;Minute;Neutral;0.9928455948829651;in addition a few participants suggested that an inflation range could convey the uncertainty associated with the available array of inflation measures or that the committees communications could more explicitly reference other measures of inflation
2020-01-29;2020;January;Minute;Negative;0.9566332697868347;some market participants suggested that the federal reserves actions in the fourth quarter to maintain ample reserve levels might have contributed to some degree to the rise in equity and other risk asset prices
2020-01-29;2020;January;Minute;Positive;0.9525980353355408;several participants also stated that employing an asymmetric operational range for a timeâwith 2 percent being at or near the lower end of that rangeâwhile still maintaining the longerrun target of 2 percent could help communicate that the committee intended inflation to average 2 percent over time which in turn could help keep longerrun inflation expectations at levels consistent with its objective

2020-01-29;2020;January;Minute;Neutral;0.6676888465881348;market commentary attributed the stability in federal funds rate expectations despite the perceived reduction in downside risks partly to the committees communications some market participants reportedly regarded those communications as signaling a relatively high bar for changes to the target range

2020-01-29;2020;January;Minute;Neutral;0.9951422214508057;while inflation is inherently variable the committee then could emphasize its intention for inflation to be centered on the 2 percent objective

2020-01-29;2020;January;Minute;Neutral;0.9879087805747986;some participants remarked that because financial stability risks are a consideration for achieving the committees dual mandate a clear communications strategy would be needed to convey the committees assessments of financial vulnerabilities and their potential implications for the monetary policy outlook
2020-01-29;2020;January;Minute;Negative;0.9871827363967896;many participants agreed that an uncertainty range could be misinterpreted as an indifference range and hence as a lack of commitment by the committee to its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective
2020-01-29;2020;January;Minute;Negative;0.6395999789237976;a few participants commented that this is especially the case when addressing risks associated with structural features such as the current low level of neutral interest rates

2020-01-29;2020;January;Minute;Neutral;0.7716965675354004;however various participants noted that while these tools could be deployed proactively to lean against the buildup of financial vulnerabilities they have some limitations in the context of the us financial system where the few available tools are for the most part not designed to address vulnerabilities outside the banking sector
2020-01-29;2020;January;Minute;Neutral;0.9878270030021667;in addition these tools are not within the authority of the committee and their use requires coordination with other prudential regulators
2020-01-29;2020;January;Minute;Neutral;0.9402782917022705;recognizing these limitations many participants remarked that the committee should not rule out the possibility of adjusting the stance of monetary policy to mitigate financial stability risks particularly when those risks have important implications for the economic outlook and when macroprudential tools had been or were likely to be ineffective at mitigating those risks
2020-01-29;2020;January;Minute;Neutral;0.9677218794822693;nevertheless many participants noted that the current knowledge of the interactions between the stance of monetary policy and financial vulnerabilities is too imprecise to warrant systematically adjusting monetary policy in response to the evolution of financial stability risks
2020-01-29;2020;January;Minute;Neutral;0.9854004979133606;as a result monetary policy should be guided primarily by the outlook for employment and inflation and it should respond to financial stability risks only insofar as such risks significantly threaten the achievement of the committees mandate
2020-01-29;2020;January;Minute;Negative;0.5795934796333313;several participants observed that the monetary policy measures needed to curb financial stability risks could be quite large and the resulting effects on employment and inflation could place a high hurdle for such measures
2020-01-29;2020;January;Minute;Neutral;0.9889208078384399;several participants noted that a communications strategy could include the possible use of financial instability escape clauses to help explain the rationale for policy actions when a buildup of financial vulnerabilities poses risks to the achievement of the committees goals
2020-01-29;2020;January;Minute;Neutral;0.992997407913208;the staffs briefing on considerations regarding the use of an inflation range focused on three different concepts of an inflation range
2020-01-29;2020;January;Minute;Neutral;0.977963924407959;first an uncertainty range could communicate the magnitude of the inherent variability of inflation that would still be consistent with achieving the committees symmetric inflation objective
2020-01-29;2020;January;Minute;Neutral;0.9934037327766418;second an operational range could signal that under some conditions the committee would prefer inflation to be away from its longerrun objective for a time such a range could potentially be used as part of a makeup policy strategy including one based on average inflation targeting or in other strategies aimed at offsetting the adverse effects of a binding effective lower bound on policy rates
2020-01-29;2020;January;Minute;Neutral;0.9823009967803955;third an indifference range could communicate that monetary policy would not respond to deviations of inflation within that range
2020-01-29;2020;January;Minute;Neutral;0.992987334728241;the briefing also summarized the experiences of foreign central banks that use inflation ranges these ranges were typically put in place many years ago often in conjunction with adopting an inflation target
2020-01-29;2020;January;Minute;Neutral;0.8307521343231201;the staff highlighted the communications challenges that could arise if an inflation range were introduced at a time when inflation had been running below the central banks objective for a number of years
2020-01-29;2020;January;Minute;Negative;0.9922477006912231;in this environment the introduction of a symmetric range around the point objective could be misinterpreted as a sign that the central bank was not concerned about inflation remaining below its stated goal a situation that could lead to inflation expectations drifting down to the lower end of the range
2020-01-29;2020;January;Minute;Neutral;0.9921767115592957;participants expressed a range of views on the potential benefits and costs of different types of inflation ranges
2020-01-29;2020;January;Minute;Negative;0.9920181632041931;most participants expressed concern that introducing a symmetric inflation range around the 2 percent objective following an extended period of inflation mostly running somewhat below 2 percent could be misperceived as a signal that the committee was comfortable with continued misses below its symmetric inflation objective
2020-01-29;2020;January;Minute;Neutral;0.9348587393760681;some participants suggested that it was not clear that introducing a range would help much in achieving the committees inflation objective they noted that introducing a range could make that objective less clear to the public
