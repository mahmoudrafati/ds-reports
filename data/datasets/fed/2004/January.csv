2004-01-28;2004;January;Minute;Neutral;0.9774025082588196;in this view even the replacement language would tend to shape expectations in ways that could complicate the conduct of policy and with the economy in a strong uptrend the committee no longer needed to utilize such special language
2004-01-28;2004;January;Minute;Neutral;0.9779115915298462;a few members while expressing agreement with respect to the merits of a language change nonetheless preferred to drop the reference to a considerable period entirely without substituting a reference to the committees ability to be patient
2004-01-28;2004;January;Minute;Negative;0.7284782528877258;a number of members commented that expectations of sustained policy accommodation appeared to have contributed to valuations in financial markets that left little room for downside risks and the change in wording might prompt those markets to adjust more appropriately to changing economic circumstances in the future
2004-01-28;2004;January;Minute;Negative;0.6918472051620483;however some differences of opinion arose with regard to the specific proposal under consideration namely to remove the reference to considerable period and to substitute one referring to patience those who fully endorsed the proposal believed that the new wording conveyed important information about the committees strategy in an environment of price stability and economic slack and under those circumstances was unlikely to have outsized effects in financial markets
2004-01-28;2004;January;Minute;Neutral;0.851361870765686;with regard to the wording of the committees press statement to be released shortly after the meeting members discussed at some length the desirability of retaining a reference from earlier statements to the prospect that an accommodative policy could be maintained for a considerable period the existing language had been explicitly qualified at the december meeting by tying it to low inflation and slack in resource use thereby underscoring the notion that a move away from the current degree of policy accommodation would depend on economic conditions rather than simply on the passage of time
2004-01-28;2004;January;Minute;Neutral;0.5832232236862183;members acknowledged that there were risks in maintaining what might eventually prove to be an overly accommodative policy stance but for now they judged that it was desirable to take risks on the side of assuring the rapid elimination of economic slack
2004-01-28;2004;January;Minute;Neutral;0.9515995383262634;in this regard they stressed that unused labor and other resources remained substantial that inflation was at a very low level and that inflation was not expected to change appreciably in either direction over the year ahead

2004-01-28;2004;January;Minute;Neutral;0.9922395944595337;all the members agreed that a change in wording was desirable not to signal a policy tightening move in the near term but rather to increase the committees flexibility to take such an action when it was deemed to be desirable and to underline that any such decision would be made on the basis of evolving economic conditions
2004-01-28;2004;January;Minute;Positive;0.9407084584236145;the members also viewed business inventory investment as likely to provide some support to the economic expansion over the year ahead
2004-01-28;2004;January;Minute;Negative;0.9862253665924072;subsequently however the release of the minutes for the october fomc meeting which indicated that at that time the committee was concerned about the possibility of persistent slack arising from rapid productivity growth and the publication of surprisingly modest growth in employment in december led most market participants to push back the date of the expected onset of tightening by several months to some time in the fall

2004-01-28;2004;January;Minute;Neutral;0.9551529884338379;the rise last year was due almost entirely to substantial increases in food and energy prices as core producer prices rose only a little after having edged down over 2002 with regard to labor costs the average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls rose modestly in the twelve months ending in december an increase somewhat below that over 2002 at its meeting on december 9 2003 the federal open market committee fomc adopted a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets consistent with keeping the federal funds rate at around 1 percent
