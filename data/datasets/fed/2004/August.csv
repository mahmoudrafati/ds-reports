2004-08-10;2004;August;Minute;Negative;0.6586069464683533;moreover the economy seemed to have responded in some past episodes to sharp increases in energy costs by much more than could be explained by most models
2004-08-10;2004;August;Minute;Negative;0.9929261803627014;while the direct effect of higher energy prices on real disposable income could account for only a relatively small part of the reduction in the growth of consumer spending some members suggested that those effects may have been exacerbated by substantial increases in expected future energy costs as well as greater uncertainty about those costs
2004-08-10;2004;August;Minute;Neutral;0.9913190007209778;regarding the outlook for inflation the most recent data were seen as consistent with an assessment that a portion of the higher rates of price increases recorded earlier in the year had reflected transitory factors
2004-08-10;2004;August;Minute;Positive;0.9922479391098022;indeed the limited available evidence pointed to a rebound in household spending especially on motor vehicles in july and early august and some indicators suggested continued improvement in labor market conditions
2004-08-10;2004;August;Minute;Positive;0.9903156161308289;with economic growth buoyed by accommodative monetary policy and supportive credit conditions more generally as well as by robust underlying growth in productivity the committee believed that conditions were in place for the pace of expansion to strengthen enough to continue to trim margins of slack in resource utilization

2004-08-10;2004;August;Minute;Negative;0.9685205221176147;while the recent moderation in growth might portend a substantially slower expansion going forward than had previously been expected the committee did not see such a sizable shortfall as the most likely outcome
2004-08-10;2004;August;Minute;Negative;0.9951629638671875;at the same time growth in payrolls had fallen back in june and july after posting significant gains in the spring
2004-08-10;2004;August;Minute;Negative;0.9953212141990662;in particular consumer spending which had previously provided considerable support to aggregate demand had slowed sharply in the second quarter

2004-08-10;2004;August;Minute;Positive;0.9613075256347656;slack resource utilization through 2005 was also expected to help hold down inflation

2004-08-10;2004;August;Minute;Negative;0.8889093399047852;committee members generally agreed that higher energy prices had played an important role in the recent moderation of economic growth
2004-08-10;2004;August;Minute;Neutral;0.6469913125038147;however policymakers noted that the monthly payrolls data might be providing an incomplete picture of expansion in economic activity because of nearterm variation in the rate of growth of productivity
2004-08-10;2004;August;Minute;Negative;0.9799250364303589;the committee discussed a number of other factors that may have contributed to the slowdown including a waning of the stimulus from last years tax cuts which had previously provided considerable impetus to spending and the possibility that with stock prices down saving rates near historic lows and the outlook more uncertain households may have felt the need to boost saving
2004-08-10;2004;August;Minute;Negative;0.9833569526672363;higher labor costs particularly those related to health benefits were also reportedly weighing on some firms hiring decisions

2004-08-10;2004;August;Minute;Positive;0.9877277612686157;a few members also noted that the commercial real estate sector which had been weak for some time was showing signs of improvement
2004-08-10;2004;August;Minute;Positive;0.9926275610923767;however the us trade deficit was expected to remain large as imports increased in response to solid growth in the united states
2004-08-10;2004;August;Minute;Negative;0.9939236044883728;indeed some members suggested that heightened uncertainty reflecting the effects of higher energy prices and increased concerns about geopolitical risks might have contributed to greater business caution of late

2004-08-10;2004;August;Minute;Positive;0.9922475814819336;continued strength in home construction did not suggest that households were in the process of retrenching and gains in income low interest rates and robust consumer confidence were seen as undergirding further gains in household spending going forward
2004-08-10;2004;August;Minute;Neutral;0.7726694345474243;although a complete accounting for the moderation in growth was not possible the committee agreed that a resumption of faster growth in consumer spending was very likely
2004-08-10;2004;August;Minute;Positive;0.992519736289978;nonetheless business confidence generally remained high and the fundamentals for investmentincluding solid growth in productivity robust profits and cash flow and accommodative financial marketspointed to continued healthy gains in business outlays
