2017-02-01;2017;February;Minute;Negative;0.5108416080474854;the committee expected that economic conditions would evolve in a manner that would warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate and that the federal funds rate was likely to remain for some time below levels expected to prevail in the longer run
2017-02-01;2017;February;Minute;Neutral;0.9891586303710938;participants also generally agreed that the committee should begin discussions at upcoming meetings about the economic conditions that could warrant changes in the existing policy of reinvesting proceeds from maturing treasury securities and principal payments from agency debt and mortgagebacked securities as well as how those changes would be implemented and communicated
2017-02-01;2017;February;Minute;Positive;0.761539101600647;however with inflation still short of the committees objective and inflation expectations remaining low a few others continued to see downside risks to inflation or anticipated only a gradual return of inflation to the 2 percent objective as the labor market strengthened further

2017-02-01;2017;February;Minute;Neutral;0.9926342368125916;most participants continued to judge that while the outlook was subject to considerable uncertainty a gradual pace of rate increases over time was likely to be appropriate to promote the committees objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation
2017-02-01;2017;February;Minute;Negative;0.9858186841011047;some participants viewed a gradual pace as likely to be warranted because inflation was still running below the committees objective or because the proximity of the federal funds rate to the effective lower bound placed constraints on the ability of monetary policy to respond to adverse shocks to the aggregate demand for goods and services
2017-02-01;2017;February;Minute;Negative;0.9055652618408203;in addition it was noted that the downward pressure on longerterm interest rates exerted by the federal reserves asset holdings was expected to diminish in the years ahead in light of an anticipated gradual reduction in the size and duration of the federal reserves balance sheet
2017-02-01;2017;February;Minute;Neutral;0.5400403738021851;finally the view that gradual increases in the federal funds rate were likely to be appropriate also reflected the assessment that the neutral real ratedefined as the real interest rate that is neither expansionary nor contractionary when the economy is operating at or near its potentialwas currently quite low and was likely to rise only slowly over time
2017-02-01;2017;February;Minute;Neutral;0.9629431366920471;participants emphasized that the committee might need to change its communications regarding the anticipated path for the policy rate if economic conditions evolved differently than the committee expected or if the economic outlook changed
2017-02-01;2017;February;Minute;Neutral;0.9734178185462952;they pointed to a number of risks that if realized might call for a different policy trajectory than they currently thought most likely to be appropriate
2017-02-01;2017;February;Minute;Negative;0.9503014087677002;these included upside risks such as appreciably more expansionary fiscal policy or a more rapid buildup of inflationary pressures as well as downside risks associated with a possible further appreciation of the dollar or financial vulnerabilities in some foreign economies together with the proximity of the federal funds rate to the effective lower bound
2017-02-01;2017;February;Minute;Negative;0.9913524389266968;moreover most participants continued to see heightened uncertainty regarding the size composition and timing of possible changes to fiscal and other government policies and about their net effects on the economy and inflation over the medium term and they thought some time would likely be required for the outlook to become clearer
2017-02-01;2017;February;Minute;Neutral;0.9491003155708313;a couple of participants argued that such uncertainty should not deter the committee from taking further steps in the near term to remove monetary policy accommodation because fiscal and other policies were only some of the many factors that were likely to influence progress toward the committees dualmandate objectives and thus the appropriate course of monetary policy
2017-02-01;2017;February;Minute;Neutral;0.9868112206459045;however other participants cautioned against adjusting monetary policy in anticipation of policy proposals that might not be enacted or that if enacted might turn out to have different consequences for economic activity and inflation than currently anticipated

2017-02-01;2017;February;Minute;Neutral;0.6467536091804504;a few participants noted that continuing to remove policy accommodation in a timely manner potentially at an upcoming meeting would allow the committee greater flexibility in responding to subsequent changes in economic conditions
2017-02-01;2017;February;Minute;Negative;0.992841362953186;several judged that the risk of a sizable undershooting of the longerrun normal unemployment rate was high particularly if economic growth was faster than currently expected
2017-02-01;2017;February;Minute;Negative;0.9346118569374084;if that situation developed the committee might need to raise the federal funds rate more quickly than most participants currently anticipated to limit the buildup of inflationary pressures
2017-02-01;2017;February;Minute;Negative;0.9787675738334656;a couple of participants expressed concern that the committees communications about a gradual pace of policy firming might be misunderstood as a commitment to only one or two rate hikes per year and stressed the importance of communicating that policy will respond to the evolving economic outlook as appropriate to achieve the committees objectives
2017-02-01;2017;February;Minute;Neutral;0.9915263056755066;however members emphasized that the actual path of the federal funds rate would depend on the evolution of the economic outlook as informed by incoming data
