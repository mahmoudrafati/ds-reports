2017-06-14;2017;June;Minute;Positive;0.9420821070671082;several participants expressed confidence that a series of further increases in the federal funds rate in coming years along the lines implied by the medians of the projections for the federal funds rate in the june sep would contribute to a stabilization over the medium term of the inflation rate around the committees 2 percent objective especially as this tightening of monetary policy would affect the economy only with a lag and would start from a point at which policy was still accommodative
