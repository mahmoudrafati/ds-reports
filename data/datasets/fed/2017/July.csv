2017-07-26;2017;July;Minute;Negative;0.9950055480003357;on the one hand many financial market indicators of uncertainty remained subdued and the uncertainty associated with the foreign outlook still appeared to be less than late last year on the other hand uncertainty about the direction of some economic policies was judged to have remained elevated
2017-07-26;2017;July;Minute;Neutral;0.5140388607978821;the staff continued to project that inflation would increase in the next couple of years and that it would be close to the committees longerrun objective in 2018 and at 2 percent in 2019 the staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years
2017-07-26;2017;July;Minute;Neutral;0.7299386858940125;beyond 2017 the forecast was little revised from the previous projection as the recent weakness in inflation was viewed as transitory
2017-07-26;2017;July;Minute;Negative;0.7699293494224548;a couple of participants noted that favorable macroeconomic factors provided backing for current equity valuations in addition as recent equity price increases did not seem to stem importantly from greater use of leverage by investors these increases might not pose appreciable risks to financial stability
2017-07-26;2017;July;Minute;Negative;0.9929026961326599;it was also observed that the budgets of some state and local governments were under strain limiting growth in their expenditures

2017-07-26;2017;July;Minute;Negative;0.8027953505516052;according to another view recent rises in equity prices might be part of a broadbased adjustment of asset prices to changes in longerterm financial conditions importantly including a lower neutral real interest rate and therefore the recent equity price increases might not provide much additional impetus to aggregate spending on goods and services
2017-07-26;2017;July;Minute;Positive;0.9921149611473083;participants noted that labor market conditions had strengthened further over the intermeeting period
2017-07-26;2017;July;Minute;Negative;0.9065064191818237;according to one view the easing of financial conditions meant that the economic effects of the committees actions in gradually removing policy accommodation had been largely offset by other factors influencing financial markets and that a tighter monetary policy than otherwise was warranted
2017-07-26;2017;July;Minute;Neutral;0.9914189577102661;however different assessments were expressed about the implications of this development for the outlook for aggregate demand and consequently appropriate monetary policy
2017-07-26;2017;July;Minute;Positive;0.9752041101455688;several participants noted that the further increases in equity prices together with continued low longerterm interest rates had led to an easing of financial conditions
2017-07-26;2017;July;Minute;Negative;0.9955558180809021;a number of participants pointed to potential concerns about low longerterm interest rates including the possibility that inflation expectations were too low that yields could rise abruptly or that low yields were inducing investors to take on excessive risk in a search for higher returns
2017-07-26;2017;July;Minute;Negative;0.992625892162323;asset purchases by foreign central banks and the federal reserves securities holdings were also likely contributing to currently low term premiums although the exact size of these contributions was uncertain
2017-07-26;2017;July;Minute;Neutral;0.8736882209777832;the level of such yields appeared to reflect both low expected future shortterm interest rates and depressed term premiums
2017-07-26;2017;July;Minute;Negative;0.5976409316062927;in assessing recent developments in financial market conditions participants referred to the continued low level of longerterm interest rates in particular those on us treasury securities
2017-07-26;2017;July;Minute;Negative;0.9634310007095337;these included a diminished responsiveness of prices to resource pressures a lower natural rate of unemployment the possibility that slack may be better measured by labor market indicators other than unemployment lags in the reaction of nominal wage growth and inflation to labor market tightening and restraints on pricing power from global developments and from innovations to business models spurred by advances in technology
2017-07-26;2017;July;Minute;Negative;0.9334374070167542;participants discussed possible reasons for the coexistence of low inflation and low unemployment
2017-07-26;2017;July;Minute;Neutral;0.803816020488739;however most participants thought that the framework remained valid notwithstanding the recent absence of a pickup in inflation in the face of a tightening labor market and real gdp growth in excess of their estimates of its potential rate
2017-07-26;2017;July;Minute;Neutral;0.9179215431213379;a few participants cited evidence suggesting that this framework was not particularly useful in forecasting inflation
2017-07-26;2017;July;Minute;Neutral;0.941241443157196;a number of participants noted that much of the analysis of inflation used in policymaking rested on a framework in which for a given rate of expected inflation the degree of upward pressures on prices and wages rose as aggregate demand for goods and services and employment of resources increased above longrun sustainable levels
2017-07-26;2017;July;Minute;Neutral;0.5271382927894592;one participant pointed to the stability of a number of measures of inflation expectations in recent months but a few others suggested that continuing low inflation expectations may have been a factor putting downward pressure on inflation or that inflation expectations might need to be bolstered in order to ensure their consistency with the committees longerterm inflation objective
2017-07-26;2017;July;Minute;Positive;0.9780954122543335;a couple of participants argued that the response of inflation to resource utilization could become stronger if output and employment appreciably overshot their full employment levels although other participants pointed out that this hypothesized nonlinear response had little empirical support
2017-07-26;2017;July;Minute;Neutral;0.8166680932044983;the absence of sizable wage pressures also seemed to be confirmed by most aggregate wage measures
2017-07-26;2017;July;Minute;Negative;0.9886474013328552;many participants however saw some likelihood that inflation might remain below 2 percent for longer than they currently expected and several indicated that the risks to the inflation outlook could be tilted to the downside
2017-07-26;2017;July;Minute;Neutral;0.9745436906814575;still most participants indicated that they expected inflation to pick up over the next couple of years from its current low level and to stabilize around the committees 2 percent objective over the medium term
2017-07-26;2017;July;Minute;Negative;0.9929189085960388;nonetheless pce price inflation on a 12âmonth basis would likely continue to be held down over the second half of the year by the effects of those factors and the monthly readings might be depressed by possible residual seasonality in measured pce inflation

2017-07-26;2017;July;Minute;Negative;0.9710420370101929;however a few participants suggested that in a tight labor market measured aggregate wage growth was being held down by compositional changes in employment associated with the hiring of less experienced workers at lower wages than those of established workers
2017-07-26;2017;July;Minute;Neutral;0.9646888375282288;district contacts confirmed tightness in the labor market but relayed little evidence of wage pressures although some firms were reportedly attempting to attract workers with a variety of nonwage benefits
