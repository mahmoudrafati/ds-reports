2011-04-27;2011;April;Minute;Neutral;0.990044116973877;a couple of participants noted that any normalization strategy would likely involve an elevated balance sheet with the federal funds rate target near the ioer rateas in floortype systemsfor some time and therefore the committee would accumulate experience during the process of normalizing policy that would allow it to make a more informed choice regarding the longerterm framework at a later date
